(Nasdaq: TYRA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing next-generation precision medicines that target large opportunities in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) biology, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate progress.\n\n\"These are exciting times at TYRA. We are very pleased with the interim data reported with TYRA-300 at ENA 2024. TYRA-300 demonstrated impressive anti-tumor activity at dose levels ≥ 90 mg once daily and was generally well-tolerated with infrequent FGFR1 and FGFR2 toxicities that limit the tolerability of pan-FGFR inhibitors. These data provide clinical support that an FGFR3 inhibitor designed to be highly selective can deliver meaningful clinical benefit to heavily pretreated patients with cancer,\" said Todd Harris, CEO of TYRA. \"These results allow us to expand into larger studies for multiple bladder cancer indications, including metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), while aiming to achieve best-in-class annualized growth velocity in achondroplasia (ACH). We look forward to initiating the Phase 2 study for ACH in the first quarter of 2025 and submitting an IND for NMIBC by the end of this year.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n**TYRA-300**\n\n  * **Reported Interim Clinical Proof-of-Concept Results from SURF301 Phase 1/2 Study**(NCT05544552) **in Patients with mUC.** In October 2024, TYRA [reported](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=2767212167&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-reports-interim-clinical-proof-concept-data&a=reported) interim data with TYRA-300 during a late-breaking oral presentation at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Barcelona, Spain. The results included encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity observed in a heavily pre-treated population: at ≥ 90 mg once daily (QD), 6 out of 11 (54.5%) patients with FGFR3+ mUC achieved a confirmed partial response (PR), with 100% disease control rate and sustained duration of activity; positive safety results were reported across all once-daily (QD) doses, with infrequent FGFR2/FGFR1-associated toxicities. The interim results warrant continued development of TYRA-300 for mUC and the Company is prioritizing QD dosing in SURF301 and future oncology studies. TYRA-300 is currently being evaluated in Part B of SURF301 at potentially therapeutic QD doses in preparation for potential future Phase 2 studies in NMIBC and mUC.\n  * **Phase 2 IND Submission for NMIBC on Track for Year-End 2024.** TYRA plans to expand the clinical development of TYRA-300 into NMIBC to address the unmet needs in this cancer population with an efficacious, orally available therapy. TYRA remains on track to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study of TYRA-300 in NMIBC before year-end 2024.\n  * **IND Clearance Received for Phase 2 Achondroplasia (ACH) Study (BEACH301).** In October 2024, TYRA [announced](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=318844385&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-receives-ind-clearance-fda-proceed-phase-2&a=announced) that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its IND application for TYRA-300 allowing the company to proceed with a Phase 2 clinical trial of TYRA-300 for children with achondroplasia (BEACH301). The study will be a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study evaluating TYRA-300 in children ages 3 to 10 with achondroplasia with open growth plates. The study will enroll children who are treatment-naïve (Cohort 1) and those who have received prior growth-accelerating therapy (Cohort 2) at multiple sites across the globe. Each of these cohorts is expected to enroll up to 10 participants per dose level (0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50 mg/kg) for up to 12 months. Prior to initiation of Cohorts 1 and 2, the study will enroll a safety sentinel cohort of up to 3 treatment-naïve participants per dose level in children ages 5 to 10. TYRA expects to dose the first child with achondroplasia in BEACH301 in Q1 2025.\n  * **Peer-Reviewed Manuscript Published in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry**. In September 2024, a manuscript titled \"_Discovery of TYRA-300: First oral selective FGFR3 inhibitor for the treatment of urothelial cancers and achondroplasia_ \" was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (J. Chem) by the American Chemical Society. The published data provides preclinical evidence that TYRA-300 is a potentially best-in-class, novel precision small molecule designed to be selective for FGFR3 while sparing FGFR1 and 2 isoform toxicities and on-target gatekeeper resistant mutations. These results support the advancement of TYRA-300 in the ongoing SURF301 Phase 1/2 clinical study and the expansion into achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia. \n\n\n\n**TYRA-200**\n\n  * **Phase 1 SURF201 Study Continued to Advance.** The SURF201 (**S** tudy in Previo**U** sly treated and **R** esistant **F** GFR2+ Cholangiocarcinoma and Other Advanced Solid Tumors) (NCT06160752) continued to advance. The study is a multi-center, open label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TYRA-200 and determine the optimal and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D, as well as evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200. TYRA-200 is an investigational, FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor with potency against activating FGFR2 gene alterations and resistance mutations. The SURF201 study is currently enrolling and dosing adults with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other advanced solid tumors with activating FGFR2 gene alterations.\n\n\n\n**TYRA-430**\n\n  * **Continued Phase 1 Planning Following IND****Clearance.** TYRA [announced](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=3100900001&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results&a=announced) that the FDA cleared its IND to proceed with a Phase 1 clinical study of TYRA-430, an investigational, FGFR4/3-biased inhibitor for FGF19+/FGFR4-driven cancers. The Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of TYRA-430 in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumors with activating FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations (SURF431). We believe TYRA-430 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in HCC, where there are no approved biomarker-driven, targeted therapies. \n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * **Appointed Doug Warner, MD, as Chief Medical Officer (CMO).** In September 2024, TYRA [announced](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=388537080&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-appoints-doug-warner-md-chief-medical-officer&a=announced) the appointment of Dr. Warner as CMO, who brings over twenty years of proven clinical development leadership to TYRA having successfully led global development and secured approvals for medicines across oncology and skeletal disease. Prior to TYRA, Dr. Warner held roles of increasing responsibility over 18 years at Amgen where he oversaw clinical development for programs across oncology and bone diseases. This included being an Executive Director and Group Product Area Lead, where Dr. Warner led a team responsible for the development of a portfolio of medicines ranging from those in Phase 1 to those with approved indications, including Vectibix®, XGEVA®, and Prolia®. Most recently, Dr. Warner was Chief Medical Officer for eFFECTOR Therapeutics where he was responsible for overseeing eFFECTOR's clinical pipeline, including its KICKSTART Phase 2b trial of tomivosertib in non-small cell lung cancer, and its Phase 1/2 study of zotatifin in solid tumors. Dr. Warner is co-author of numerous peer-reviewed articles including those in The Lancet, The Lancet Oncology, and The Journal of Clinical Oncology. He received his B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, his M.D. from the Duke University School of Medicine, and his M.B.A. from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.\n\n\n\n**SNÅP****Platform and Pipeline**\n\n  * TYRA continued to advance its in-house precision medicine discovery engine, SNÅP, to develop therapies in targeted oncology and genetically defined conditions.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net loss was $24.0 million compared to $21.2 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * Third quarter 2024 research and development expenses were $22.7 million compared to $19.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by increased expenses incurred in connection with our ongoing and planned clinical trials and personnel-related costs, partially offset by decreased drug manufacturing and preclinical costs.\n  * Third quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses were $5.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, TYRA had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $360.1 million. The Company's current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are expected to allow TYRA to execute on its plans through at least 2026.\n\n\n\n**About TYRA-300**\n\nTYRA-300 is the Company's lead precision medicine program stemming from its in-house SNÅP platform. TYRA-300 is an investigational, oral, FGFR3-selective inhibitor currently in development for the treatment of cancer and skeletal dysplasias, including achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia. In oncology, TYRA-300 is being evaluated in a multi-center, open label Phase 1/2 clinical study, SURF301 (**S** tudy in **U** ntreated and **R** esistant **F** GFR3+ Advanced Solid Tumors) (NCT05544552). The study is designed to determine the optimal and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TYRA-300, as well as to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-300. Part A of the study included patients with all solid tumors who are FGFR3 +/-, and explored doses of TYRA-300 ranging from 10mg -120mg once-daily (QD). Part A of SURF301 is complete. The Company continues to advance TYRA-300 through dose expansion in Part B, which includes patients with solid tumors who are FGFR3+, to evaluate potentially therapeutic doses in preparation for potential future Phase 2 studies in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In skeletal dysplasia, TYRA-300 has demonstrated positive preclinical results in achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia and TYRA has received IND clearance from the FDA to proceed with its BEACH301 clinical trial in children with achondroplasia.\n\n**About TYRA-200**\n\nTYRA-200 is an investigational, oral, FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor with potency against activating FGFR2 gene alterations and resistance mutations currently in development for the treatment of cancer.

(Nasdaq: TYRA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing next-generation precision medicines that target large opportunities in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) biology, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for TYRA-300 allowing the company to proceed with a Phase 2 clinical trial of TYRA-300 for children with achondroplasia (BEACH301).\n\nTYRA-300 is a potential first-in-class, investigational, oral, FGFR3-selective inhibitor designed to avoid the toxicities associated with inhibition of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR4. TYRA-300 is also being evaluated for metastatic urothelial cancer in the ongoing SURF301 study, where interim clinical proof-of-concept data were recently [reported](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4287981-1&h=3682506833&u=https%3A%2F%2Furl.avanan.click%2Fv2%2F___https%3A%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-reports-interim-clinical-proof-concept-data___.YXAzOnR5cmExOmE6bzphMWQxYjdhZTk4NjY5ZWNiYTczZmE2NzdhMDc0ZTMwYjo2OjcxMjg6OWY3MmM2ZWE2NzEwN2EwYjM4NDNkYThlNmIzYzYyOTkyNzBmM2M5ODAxMGIyY2E2NDRmNGY2YjljNzRmMjBhNjpwOlQ6Rg&a=reported) at the ENA 2024 meeting.\n\n\"IND clearance to proceed with BEACH301 is a significant milestone for the achondroplasia community and for TYRA, as we move into the clinic to treat our first rare skeletal dysplasia indication,\" said Todd Harris, CEO of TYRA. \"We believe FGFR3 is the right target for achondroplasia, with almost one hundred percent of cases being driven by a specific mutation in the _FGFR3_ gene. TYRA-300 has the potential to precisely engage FGFR3 to potentially achieve a higher annualized growth velocity, and lead to important functional outcomes and clinical benefits such as improvements in reach, gait and spinal disease.\" \n\nMr. Harris continued, \"The currently available therapy is a once-daily injection that delivers modest increases in annualized growth velocity. As a highly selective FGFR3 inhibitor, we are hopeful that TYRA-300 may provide an improved therapeutic option for achondroplasia, and we are excited about our opportunity to potentially deliver improvements with our differentiated oral therapy in BEACH301.\"\n\nBEACH301 will be a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study evaluating TYRA-300 in children ages 3 to 10 with achondroplasia with open growth plates. The study will enroll children who are treatment-naïve (Cohort 1) and those who have received prior growth-accelerating therapy (Cohort 2) at multiple sites across the globe. Each of these cohorts is expected to enroll up to 10 participants per dose level (0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50 mg/kg) for up to 12 months. Prior to initiation of Cohorts 1 and 2, the study will enroll a safety sentinel cohort of up to 3 treatment-naïve participants per dose level in children ages 5 to 10.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study will be to assess safety and tolerability in children with achondroplasia and evaluate change from baseline in annualized growth velocity to determine the dose(s) for further development. Secondary objectives will include evaluating change from baseline in height z-score, proportionality and pharmacokinetics (PK). TYRA is also planning exploratory assessments of clinical outcomes such as functional improvements, changes in the spine, and quality of life measures.\n\n\"We are excited to expand the clinical development of TYRA-300 into achondroplasia with BEACH301. Our existing database from the SURF301 oncology study includes information on doses significantly higher than what we are planning in achondroplasia. We believe this information suggest TYRA-300 may be well tolerated at low doses in children,\" said Doug Warner, MD, Chief Medical Officer of TYRA. \"We are continuing to engage with the achondroplasia community, including advocates and physicians, as we actively work to initiate the BEACH301 study and commence dosing in the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\nIn July 2023 and January 2024, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Designation (RPD) to TYRA-300, respectively, for the treatment of achondroplasia. TYRA is committed to exploring the potential of TYRA-300 for functional impacts and quality of life measures in achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasia.\n\n**About TYRA-300**\n\nTYRA-300 is the Company's lead precision medicine program stemming from its in-house SNÅP platform. TYRA-300 is an investigational, oral, FGFR3-selective inhibitor currently in development for the treatment of cancer and skeletal dysplasia, including achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia. In oncology, TYRA-300 is being evaluated in a multi-center, open label Phase 1/2 clinical study, SURF301 (**S** tudy in **U** ntreated and **R** esistant **F** GFR3+ Advanced Solid Tumors) (_NCT05544552_). The study is designed to determine the optimal and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TYRA-300, as well as to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-300. Part A of the study included patients with all solid tumors who are FGFR3 +/-, and explored doses of TYRA-300 ranging from 10mg -120mg once-daily (QD). Part A of SURF301 is complete. The Company continues to advance TYRA-300 through dose expansion in Part B, which includes patients with solid tumors who are FGFR3+, to evaluate potentially therapeutic doses in preparation for potential future Phase 2 studies in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In skeletal dysplasia, TYRA-300 has demonstrated positive preclinical results in achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia and TYRA has received IND clearance from the U.S FDA to proceed with its BEACH301 clinical trial in children with achondroplasia.\n\n**About Achondroplasia**\n\nAchondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism with limited therapeutic options. It is estimated that 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 children are born have achondroplasia, with approximately 250,000 affected individuals worldwide. People living with achondroplasia may experience severe complications including foramen magnum and spinal stenosis, sleep apnea and disproportionate short stature. An _FGFR3_ G380R gain of function mutation accounts for approximately 99% of achondroplasia. TYRA-300 is a first-in-class oral FGFR3 selective inhibitor whose design may have a meaningful impact on achondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasia.\n\n**About Tyra Biosciences**\n\nTyra Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: TYRA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing next-generation precision medicines that target large opportunities in FGFR biology. The Company's in-house precision medicine platform, SNÅP, enables rapid and precise drug design through iterative molecular SNÅPshots that help predict genetic alterations most likely to cause acquired resistance to existing therapies. TYRA's expertise in FGFR biology has created a differentiated pipeline with three clinical-stage programs in targeted oncology and genetically defined conditions. The Company's lead precision medicine stemming from SNÅP, TYRA-300, is a potential first-in-class selective FGFR3 inhibitor that is designed to avoid the toxicities associated with inhibition of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR4, while being agnostic for the FGFR3 gatekeeper mutations. TYRA-300 is in development for the treatment of cancer in the SURF301 Phase 1/2 study and for achondroplasia in the BEACH301 Phase 2 study. TYRA is also developing TYRA-200, an investigational, FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor, in the SURF201 study for metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and TYRA-430, an investigational FGFR4/3-biased inhibitor for FGF19+/FGFR4-driven cancers.

(Nasdaq: TYRA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing next-generation precision medicines that target large opportunities in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) biology, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate progress.\n\n\"These are exciting times at TYRA. We are very pleased with the interim data reported with TYRA-300 at ENA 2024. TYRA-300 demonstrated impressive anti-tumor activity at dose levels ≥ 90 mg once daily and was generally well-tolerated with infrequent FGFR1 and FGFR2 toxicities that limit the tolerability of pan-FGFR inhibitors. These data provide clinical support that an FGFR3 inhibitor designed to be highly selective can deliver meaningful clinical benefit to heavily pretreated patients with cancer,\" said Todd Harris, CEO of TYRA. \"These results allow us to expand into larger studies for multiple bladder cancer indications, including metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), while aiming to achieve best-in-class annualized growth velocity in achondroplasia (ACH). We look forward to initiating the Phase 2 study for ACH in the first quarter of 2025 and submitting an IND for NMIBC by the end of this year.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n**TYRA-300**\n\n  * **Reported Interim Clinical Proof-of-Concept Results from SURF301 Phase 1/2 Study**(NCT05544552) **in Patients with mUC.** In October 2024, TYRA [reported](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=2767212167&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-reports-interim-clinical-proof-concept-data&a=reported) interim data with TYRA-300 during a late-breaking oral presentation at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Barcelona, Spain. The results included encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity observed in a heavily pre-treated population: at ≥ 90 mg once daily (QD), 6 out of 11 (54.5%) patients with FGFR3+ mUC achieved a confirmed partial response (PR), with 100% disease control rate and sustained duration of activity; positive safety results were reported across all once-daily (QD) doses, with infrequent FGFR2/FGFR1-associated toxicities. The interim results warrant continued development of TYRA-300 for mUC and the Company is prioritizing QD dosing in SURF301 and future oncology studies. TYRA-300 is currently being evaluated in Part B of SURF301 at potentially therapeutic QD doses in preparation for potential future Phase 2 studies in NMIBC and mUC.\n  * **Phase 2 IND Submission for NMIBC on Track for Year-End 2024.** TYRA plans to expand the clinical development of TYRA-300 into NMIBC to address the unmet needs in this cancer population with an efficacious, orally available therapy. TYRA remains on track to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study of TYRA-300 in NMIBC before year-end 2024.\n  * **IND Clearance Received for Phase 2 Achondroplasia (ACH) Study (BEACH301).** In October 2024, TYRA [announced](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=318844385&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-receives-ind-clearance-fda-proceed-phase-2&a=announced) that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its IND application for TYRA-300 allowing the company to proceed with a Phase 2 clinical trial of TYRA-300 for children with achondroplasia (BEACH301). The study will be a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study evaluating TYRA-300 in children ages 3 to 10 with achondroplasia with open growth plates. The study will enroll children who are treatment-naïve (Cohort 1) and those who have received prior growth-accelerating therapy (Cohort 2) at multiple sites across the globe. Each of these cohorts is expected to enroll up to 10 participants per dose level (0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50 mg/kg) for up to 12 months. Prior to initiation of Cohorts 1 and 2, the study will enroll a safety sentinel cohort of up to 3 treatment-naïve participants per dose level in children ages 5 to 10. TYRA expects to dose the first child with achondroplasia in BEACH301 in Q1 2025.\n  * **Peer-Reviewed Manuscript Published in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry**. In September 2024, a manuscript titled \"_Discovery of TYRA-300: First oral selective FGFR3 inhibitor for the treatment of urothelial cancers and achondroplasia_ \" was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (J. Chem) by the American Chemical Society. The published data provides preclinical evidence that TYRA-300 is a potentially best-in-class, novel precision small molecule designed to be selective for FGFR3 while sparing FGFR1 and 2 isoform toxicities and on-target gatekeeper resistant mutations. These results support the advancement of TYRA-300 in the ongoing SURF301 Phase 1/2 clinical study and the expansion into achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia. \n\n\n\n**TYRA-200**\n\n  * **Phase 1 SURF201 Study Continued to Advance.** The SURF201 (**S** tudy in Previo**U** sly treated and **R** esistant **F** GFR2+ Cholangiocarcinoma and Other Advanced Solid Tumors) (NCT06160752) continued to advance. The study is a multi-center, open label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TYRA-200 and determine the optimal and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D, as well as evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200. TYRA-200 is an investigational, FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor with potency against activating FGFR2 gene alterations and resistance mutations. The SURF201 study is currently enrolling and dosing adults with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other advanced solid tumors with activating FGFR2 gene alterations.\n\n\n\n**TYRA-430**\n\n  * **Continued Phase 1 Planning Following IND****Clearance.** TYRA [announced](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=3100900001&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results&a=announced) that the FDA cleared its IND to proceed with a Phase 1 clinical study of TYRA-430, an investigational, FGFR4/3-biased inhibitor for FGF19+/FGFR4-driven cancers. The Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of TYRA-430 in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumors with activating FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations (SURF431). We believe TYRA-430 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in HCC, where there are no approved biomarker-driven, targeted therapies. \n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * **Appointed Doug Warner, MD, as Chief Medical Officer (CMO).** In September 2024, TYRA [announced](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4297367-1&h=388537080&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.tyra.bio%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftyra-biosciences-appoints-doug-warner-md-chief-medical-officer&a=announced) the appointment of Dr. Warner as CMO, who brings over twenty years of proven clinical development leadership to TYRA having successfully led global development and secured approvals for medicines across oncology and skeletal disease. Prior to TYRA, Dr. Warner held roles of increasing responsibility over 18 years at Amgen where he oversaw clinical development for programs across oncology and bone diseases. This included being an Executive Director and Group Product Area Lead, where Dr. Warner led a team responsible for the development of a portfolio of medicines ranging from those in Phase 1 to those with approved indications, including Vectibix®, XGEVA®, and Prolia®. Most recently, Dr. Warner was Chief Medical Officer for eFFECTOR Therapeutics where he was responsible for overseeing eFFECTOR's clinical pipeline, including its KICKSTART Phase 2b trial of tomivosertib in non-small cell lung cancer, and its Phase 1/2 study of zotatifin in solid tumors. Dr. Warner is co-author of numerous peer-reviewed articles including those in The Lancet, The Lancet Oncology, and The Journal of Clinical Oncology. He received his B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, his M.D. from the Duke University School of Medicine, and his M.B.A. from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.\n\n\n\n**SNÅP****Platform and Pipeline**\n\n  * TYRA continued to advance its in-house precision medicine discovery engine, SNÅP, to develop therapies in targeted oncology and genetically defined conditions.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net loss was $24.0 million compared to $21.2 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * Third quarter 2024 research and development expenses were $22.7 million compared to $19.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by increased expenses incurred in connection with our ongoing and planned clinical trials and personnel-related costs, partially offset by decreased drug manufacturing and preclinical costs.\n  * Third quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses were $5.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, TYRA had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $360.1 million. The Company's current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are expected to allow TYRA to execute on its plans through at least 2026.\n\n\n\n**About TYRA-300**\n\nTYRA-300 is the Company's lead precision medicine program stemming from its in-house SNÅP platform. TYRA-300 is an investigational, oral, FGFR3-selective inhibitor currently in development for the treatment of cancer and skeletal dysplasias, including achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia. In oncology, TYRA-300 is being evaluated in a multi-center, open label Phase 1/2 clinical study, SURF301 (**S** tudy in **U** ntreated and **R** esistant **F** GFR3+ Advanced Solid Tumors) (NCT05544552). The study is designed to determine the optimal and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TYRA-300, as well as to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-300. Part A of the study included patients with all solid tumors who are FGFR3 +/-, and explored doses of TYRA-300 ranging from 10mg -120mg once-daily (QD). Part A of SURF301 is complete. The Company continues to advance TYRA-300 through dose expansion in Part B, which includes patients with solid tumors who are FGFR3+, to evaluate potentially therapeutic doses in preparation for potential future Phase 2 studies in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In skeletal dysplasia, TYRA-300 has demonstrated positive preclinical results in achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia and TYRA has received IND clearance from the FDA to proceed with its BEACH301 clinical trial in children with achondroplasia.\n\n**About TYRA-200**\n\nTYRA-200 is an investigational, oral, FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor with potency against activating FGFR2 gene alterations and resistance mutations currently in development for the treatment of cancer. TYRA-200 is being evaluated in a multi-center, open label Phase 1 clinical study, SURF201 (**S** tudy in Previo**U** sly treated and **R** esistant **F** GFR2+ Cholangiocarcinoma and Other Advanced Solid Tumors). SURF201 (NCT06160752) was designed to determine the optimal and MTD and the RP2D of TYRA-200, as well as to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200. SURF201 is currently enrolling adults with advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other advanced solid tumors with activating alterations in FGFR2.\n\n**About Tyra Biosciences**\n\nTyra Biosciences, Inc.
