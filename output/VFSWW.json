(“VinFast” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VFS), a pure-play electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer with the mission of making EVs accessible to everyone, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024.**_\n\n  * VinFast reported strong third-quarter results, delivering 21,912 vehicles, a 115% year-over-year increase. Revenue reached US$511.6 million, up 49.3% year-over-year.\n\n  * The Company became thetop-selling automotive brand in Vietnam for September, October, and for the first ten months of 2024while continuing to make strides in its global expansion.\n\n  * VinFast remains committed to its growth strategy and has secured capital commitments to support its expansion plans. The Company is focused on balancing revenue growth and optimizing costs.\n\n\n\n\n_**Madam Thuy Le, Chairwoman of VinFast,** said: “The third quarter’s result was underpinned by a robust September, as we recorded the highest monthly deliveries in our home market, Vietnam. This marks a historic milestone for Vietnam’s automotive industry where, for the first time since we were established seven years ago, a domestic OEM has outperformed international competitors to become the market leader across the passenger vehicle market. We expect to finish 2024 on a strong note and meet our 80,000-vehicle delivery target, as the momentum in Q3 has continued into Q4. Producing high-quality electric vehicles is a complex task, one that requires unwavering dedication and fortitude to navigate ongoing uncertainties. Every day we are learning how to make durable and exciting EVs that will be a key part of the global transition to green mobility. The path to green mobility is challenging, but our commitment to this future is resolute—because the future is, without question, electric.”_\n\n_**Ms. Lan Anh Nguyen, Chief Financial Officer of VinFast,** added: “I am pleased to share that Q3’24 was in line with our internal forecast, driven by an acceleration in our top line and an improvement in profitability as gross loss and net loss narrowed significantly. Increasing scale, ongoing BOM and production cost optimization and improved operating efficiencies have already started to have a positive impact on gross margin and will continue to be key drivers for our path to profitability. Our overall liquidity position has been enhanced by the recently announced loans from Vingroup and grants from our Founder, whereby we expect to receive a potential of $3.5 billion injection by the end of 2026.” _\n\n**EV Deliveries Up 115%, Revenue Up 4****9****.****3****%**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, VinFast delivered 21,912 electric vehicles. This represents a substantial increase of 66% compared to the second quarter of the same year and a significant 115% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. Notably, B2C deliveries experienced a considerable quarterly increase of 163%, highlighting strong market demand for VinFast's EVs.\n\nTotal revenues were VND12,326,537 million (US$511.6million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 49.3% from the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 42.2% from the second quarter of 2024. \n\nGross loss was VND2,957,886 million (US$122.8million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 45.6% from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was negative 24.0%. This represents a significant improvement compared to the negative 27.0% margin in the same quarter of the previous year and the negative 62.7% margin in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNet loss was VND13,251,944 million (US$550.0 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 14.8% from the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 29.4% from the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**The Vietnamese Market Significantly Contributes to Revenue Growth**\n\nIn September, VinFast recorded robust monthly deliveries in its home market of Vietnam, firmly positioning VinFast as the top-selling car brand in Vietnam for the month. This marked the first time ever that a Vietnamese EV brand outperformed all international competitors to become the market leader in terms of monthly sales.\n\nIn October, VinFast delivered more than 11,000 EVs to customers in Vietnam, representing a 21% increase compared to September and bringing total deliveries in Vietnam to more than 51,000 EVs from January 1 to October 31, 2024. This positioned VinFast as the best-selling automotive brand in the Vietnamese market for October and the first ten months of 2024.\n\nIn response to increasing demand for affordable EVs and to improve production efficiencies, the Company plans to add a new completely knocked down (CKD) factory in Ha Tinh, Vietnam focusing on VF 3 and VF 5. The factory will be under a long-term lease structure to optimize initial spendings. \n\nThe factory targets a maximum capacity of 300,000 EVs per year, subject to demand and general market conditions, with a gradual ramp up in capacity and production overtime. The construction of the factory will begin in early December, and the factory is expected to commence operations in 2025.\n\n**VinFast Expands Global Footprint**\n\nVinFastcontinues to expand its global reach. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had 173 showrooms globally for EVs and 160 showrooms and service workshops for e-scooters, including VinFast showrooms and dealer showrooms.\n\nThe Company’s acceleration towards a dealership model as part of its international strategy is starting to pay off. September was a record-breaking month for VinFast in North America, driven by a growing dealer network and continuous improvements to its electric vehicles. In November, VinFast started delivering the VF 9 to customers in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn Indonesia, VinFast has initiated the delivery of its first right-hand drive VF e34 and VF 5, with a growing network of 17 dealerships spanning 15 cities as of October 31, 2024. The Company is also working on its plant in Subang, scheduled to commence operations in 2025.\n\nIn the Philippines, VinFast opened reservations for three models – the VF 3, VF 5, and VF 7. As of October 31, VinFast had eight dealer stores in six Philippine cities.\n\nVinFast's Indian plant, with an annual capacity of 50,000 electric vehicles, is gearing up for equipment and machinery installation. The plant is scheduled to begin operations in 2025.\n\nVinFast alsoofficially launched its brand in the Middle East in October, opening its first dealership in United Arab Emirates, located in downtown Dubai.\n\n**VinFast Secures Significant Funding**\n\nVinFast has received financial backing from its founder and parent company. VinFast’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pham Nhat Vuong, and his associated companies intend to provide up to VND50 trillion (US$2.1 billion) in free grants to the Company and its subsidiaries through the end of 2026.\n\nIn addition, Vingroup Joint Stock Company intends for it and its subsidiaries (collectively “Vingroup”) to provide VinFast’s subsidiaries incorporated in Vietnam with up to VND35 trillion (US$1.5 billion) in loans through the end of 2026. \n\nVingroup has approved the plan for additional capital contributions to VFTP, a direct subsidiary of VinFast holding the Company’s EV manufacturing business in Vietnam, by converting up to VND80 trillion (US$3.3 billion) of loans extended by Vingroup to VFTP into preference shares issued by VFTP.\n\n**VinFast Poised for Strong Finish to 2024**\n\nThe Vietnamese Nasdaq-listed electric vehicle manufacturer is optimistic about its performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. Building on the strong momentum from the third quarter, particularly in key markets like Vietnam and North America, VinFastis reiterating its annual delivery target of 80,000 vehicles.\n\nTo ensure sustainable growth, VinFast remains committed to prudent financial management and cost optimization. The Company is actively working to improve its profitability while continuing to expand its global footprint.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company's management will host its 3Q24 earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on November 26, 2024.

This is the second electric car model VinFast has delivered in Indonesia, reinforcing its mission to make electric vehicles accessible for all and contributing to the green transportation revolution in Indonesia and throughout the region.**_\n\n**In just nine months since entering the Indonesian market, VinFast has delivered two electric car models in two of the most popular segments: the VF 5 (A-segment) and the VF e34 (C-segment).**\n\nThe VF 5 has become one of VinFast's best-selling models in 2024, significantly contributing to the company’s top market share in Vietnam. Building on this success, VinFast seeks to establish the VF 5 as a key model in Indonesia as it continues to penetrate the market through three core pillars: premium-quality vehicles, inclusive pricing, and exceptional after-sales policies.\n\n**The A-segment model combines a robust, compact design with superior safety features compared to gasoline cars in the same segment, making it an ideal choice for urban drivers. It targets Indonesian consumers interested in the green transportation movement, especially in the Jakarta metropolitan area.**\n\n**The VF 5 is currently available in Indonesia with a promotional on-the-road price in Jakarta of****286,450,000 IDR****(with battery purchase) and****218,250,000 IDR****(with battery subscription). VinFast offers flexible purchasing options: customers can buy the VF 5 with the battery included or opt for a battery subscription plan starting at just 990.000 IDR per month. Additionally, customers choosing** installment**plans will benefit from 0% interest, no administrative fees, and no service charges for the first year.**\n\n**To alleviate potential concerns about transitioning to electric vehicles in Indonesia, VinFast has introduced an attractive resale value guarantee. Vehicles that have been used for 6 months will retain up to 90% of their original value, after one year, 86%, after two years, 78%, and after three years, 70%.**\n\n**Furthermore, in Indonesia, the VF 5 comes with the market-leading warranty: seven years or 160,000 kilometers (whichever comes first) for the vehicle and eight years with no distance traveled limit for the battery.**\n\n**Nguyen Thuy Linh, CEO of VinFast Indonesia,****shared:**_**\"By delivering the first VF 5 cars at Gaikindo Jakarta Auto Week, we are proud to provide Indonesian consumers with more exciting, reliable and smart EV options. By introducing our dynamic urban vehicles, VinFast is committed to accompanying Indonesian customers in the green transportation revolution and contributing to building a better and more sustainable future for everyone.\"**_\n\n**VinFast’s booth at Gaikindo Jakarta Auto Week will be open to visitors from November 22 to December 1, 2024. The VF 5 delivery ceremony is scheduled for November 22. Starting from November 24, attendees can also test drive the VF 5 and VF e34 to experience these smart and modern electric vehicles, tailored for urban lifestyles.**\n\n***\n\n**About VinFast**\n\nVinFast (NASDAQ: VFS), a subsidiary of Vingroup JSC, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, is a pure-play electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer with the mission of making EVs accessible to everyone.

This launch reinforces VinFast’s commitment to establishing a foothold in one of the world’s most competitive automotive markets while offering eco-conscious consumers premium choices in the full-size SUV segment, which currently has limited electric vehicle options.**_\n\nBeginning in November, the VF 9 will be available for delivery across VinFast’s retail store network in California and through its dealerships, with prices starting at **$69,800** for the Eco version and **$73,800** for the Plus version. The first VF 9 customers received their vehicles during a customer event at VinFast’s Los Angeles headquarters.\n\nAs part of a limited-time promotion for the first 100 VF 9 vehicles delivered in the U.S., VinFast is offering qualified lessees the Plus version for a lease price of **$529** per month. This rate includes a direct discount of $3,500 and a down payment of $2,000. VinFast VF 9 Eco will be available in the U.S. market later this year. \n\n**Mr. Mike Nolte, Network Sales Vice President of VinFast U.S.,** stated: _“We are very excited to officially hand over the VF 9, VinFast’s second e-SUV model in the U.S. market. VF 9 is one of the few seven-passenger, 3-row electric car models on the market. We believe that the VF 9 will be the ideal vehicle for large families, delivering premium quality and a luxurious experience while maintaining excellent value.”_\n\nThe VF 9 is positioned as a seven-passenger, 3-row, all-electric SUV with dimensions of **201.5 inches in length, 78.9 inches in width, and 66.7 inches in height** , making it ideal for families seeking spacious, eco-friendly transport. Its impressive ground clearance of 7.2 inches is ideal for a full-size SUV in today’s market.\n\nThe vehicle offers an EPA-estimated range of **330 miles** for the Eco model and **291 miles** for the Plus model. It includes the VinFast app, which offers an extensive network of public charging options, more than most other OEM or third-party apps, making it easier for drivers to locate charging stations.\n\nAs the flagship model in VinFast’s lineup, the VF 9 showcases a striking Pininfarina design and is equipped with advanced features, including an enhanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and a smart infotainment suite. It includes 11 airbags, ensuring safety at every mile of the owner’s journey. Ongoing software updates will provide optimal user experience.\n\nWithout an internal combustion engine, the electric VF 9 offers increased cargo capacity compared to its internal combustion counterparts and includes an additional frunk under the hood. The interior features a customizable 15.6-inch touchscreen with internet capabilities, allowing for streaming, web browsing, and navigation.\n\nThe VF 9 comes with an industry-leading warranty and service package, covering 10 years or 125,000 miles for the vehicle, along with 24/7 roadside assistance and mobile repair services.\n\nVF 9 owners will also benefit from VinFast’s customer support network, which currently includes **15** stores and 4 service centers in California and partnerships with **36** dealerships across **15** states nationwide. This network is continually growing as VinFast strives to provide a reliable and premium EV ownership experience for U.S. drivers.\n\n***\n\n**About VinFast**\n\nVinFast (NASDAQ: VFS), a subsidiary of Vingroup JSC, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, is a pure-play EV manufacturer with the mission of making EVs accessible to everyone.
