(\"EverCommerce\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: EVCM), a leading service commerce platform, today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** of $176.3 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to $174.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. **Pro Forma Revenue** , which excludes fitness, increased 4.3% compared to $169.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Subscription and transaction fee revenue** of $137.6 million, an increase of 3.7% compared to $132.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. **Pro Forma subscription and transaction fee revenue** , which excludes fitness, increased 8.3% compared to $127.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net loss** was $9.2 million, or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $0.6 million, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** was $44.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $41.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n“EverCommerce's third quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range for both Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong execution across our SaaS business lines,” said Eric Remer, EverCommerce’s Founder and CEO. “Looking ahead to 2025, our focus is on implementing our transformation and optimization initiatives, which include strategic investments with an eye towards future growth acceleration.”\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included at the end of this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Metrics.”\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nThe Company repurchased and retired 1.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $14.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, $39.4 million remained available under the Repurchase Program.\n\nRepurchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company expects to fund repurchases with cash on hand.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nBased on information as of today, November 12, 2024, the Company is issuing the following financial guidance for the fourth quarter 2024; full year 2024 guidance is unchanged. Note that the revenue guidance excludes now-divested fitness assets.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024:**\n\n  * **Revenue** is expected to be in the range of $168 million to $172 million.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** is expected to be in the range of $43 million to $46 million.\n\n\n\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to certain charges excluded from this non-GAAP measure; in particular, the measures and efforts of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. It is important to note that these charges could be material to EverCommerce's results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nEverCommerce’s management team will hold a conference call to discuss our third quarter 2024 results and outlook today, November 12, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET. Please visit the \"Investor Relations\" page of the Company's website (https://investors.evercomerce.com) for both telephonic and webcast access to this call as well as a copy of the presentation materials used on the call. An archive replay will be available following the conclusion of the call.\n\n**Investor Contact**\n\nBrad KorchSVP and Head of Investor Relations720-796-7664IR@evercommerce.com\n\n**Media Contact** Jeanne TroganVP of Communications737-465-2897Press@evercommerce.com\n\n**About EverCommerce**\n\nEverCommerce (Nasdaq: EVCM) is a leading service commerce platform, providing vertically-tailored, integrated SaaS solutions that help more than 690,000 global service-based businesses accelerate growth, streamline operations, and increase retention.

All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding our future operations and financial results, implementation of our transformation and optimization initiatives, our market opportunity, future stock repurchases, our potential for growth and our strategy.

These factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Metrics**\n\nEverCommerce has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). EverCommerce uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing EverCommerce’s financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with EverCommerce’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of EverCommerce’s historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\n_Pro Forma Revenue and Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate._ Pro Forma Revenue and Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our consolidated operating performance over time. Management also uses this metric for planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nOur year-over-year Pro Forma Revenue and Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate are calculated as though all acquisitions and divestitures completed as of the end of the latest period were completed as of the first day of the prior year period presented. In calculating Pro Forma Revenue and Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate, we add the revenue from acquisitions for the reporting periods prior to the date of acquisition (including estimated purchase accounting adjustments) and exclude revenue from divestitures for the reporting periods prior to the date of divestiture, and then, for Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate, calculate our revenue growth rate between the two reported periods. As a result, these metrics include pro forma revenue from businesses acquired and excludes revenue from businesses divested of during the period, including revenue generated during periods when we did not yet own the acquired businesses and excludes revenue prior to the divestiture of the business. In including such pre-acquisition revenue and excluding pre-divestiture revenue, these metrics allow us to measure the underlying revenue growth of our business as it stands as of the end of the respective period, which we believe provides insight into our then-current operations. Pro Forma Revenue and Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate do not represent organic revenue generated by our business as it stood at the beginning of the respective period. Pro Forma Revenue and Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rates are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or actual results that might have been achieved had the acquisitions and divestitures been consummated on the first day of the prior year period presented. We believe that these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing our financial and operational performance period over period and evaluating the growth of our business, normalizing for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. These metrics are particularly useful to management due to the number of acquired entities.\n\n_Adjusted Gross Profit_. Adjusted Gross Profit is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operational performance, as it represents the results of revenues and direct costs, which are key components of our operations. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it reflects the gross profitability of our operations, and excludes the indirect costs associated with our sales and marketing, product development, general and administrative activities, and depreciation and amortization, and the impact of our financing methods and income taxes.\n\nGross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), amortization of developed technology, amortization of capitalized software and depreciation expense (allocated to cost of revenues). We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization allocated to cost of revenues. Adjusted Gross Profit should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss) or profitability.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin_. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it provides a comparable overview of our operations across historical periods. In addition, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different tax rates, and/or different forms of employee compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used by our management team as additional measures of our performance for purposes of business decision-making, including managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin help our management identify additional trends in our financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees. Our Management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude interest and other expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, other amortization, stock-based compensation and transaction-related and other non-recurring costs. Other amortization includes amortization for capitalized contract acquisition costs. Transaction-related costs are specific deal-related costs such as legal fees, financial and tax due diligence, consulting and escrow fees. Other non-recurring costs are expenses such as impairment charges, (gains) losses from divestitures, system implementation costs, executive separation costs, severance expense related to planned restructuring activities, and costs associated with integration and transformation improvements. Transaction-related and other non-recurring costs are excluded as they are not representative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss).\n\n**EverCommerce Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets****(in thousands, except per share and share amounts)****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**
