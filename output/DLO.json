After an admittedly soft first quarter, we see\nourselves consistently gaining momentum. Despite a tough 2023 comparison, driven by extraordinary\ngains in Argentina, we have once again returnedtodeliveringaquarterofrecordresultsinTotalPayment\nVolume and Gross Profit.Ourmargins,cashposition,andcashconversionhaveallimprovedquarterafter\nquarterthroughout2024.Ayearthatstartedoffadmittedlyweak,hasgainedpositivemomentum.\nLet me go into greater detail now, starting off with our top line results. We continuetodeliversignificant\ngrowth, with TPV re-accelerating to over 40% year-over-year, drivenbyourcontinuedabilitytoexpandour\nshare of wallet of our existing global merchant base, as well as onboard new merchants. Both things\nunderscoring our position as a trusted partner for global companies seeking to do business across\nemerging markets. Our performance this quarter was strong across diverse verticals, countries and\nproducts,notably:\nQ3 2024 Earnings - Transcript\n● We rampedupoperationsinmorecountries,offeredmorepaymentmethodsandgainedshareof\nwallet across important logos in the financial services, SaaS, on-demand delivery, advertising,\nride-hailingandcommerceverticals.\n● WeincreasedpaymentsvolumeinArgentina,Mexico,EgyptandOtherLatam-mainlyinColombia\nandPeru-aswellasOtherAfricaandAsia,withstrongperformanceinSouthAfrica.\n● We reported record volume in our higher take ratecross-border(XB)business,surpassingthe$3\nbillionquarterlymarkinflowsforthefirsttime.\nOur pipeline remains robust, including both growth opportunities with existing merchants aswellasnew\nmerchants. During the period, we successfullyintegratedmajorplayers,includingMoneyGram,oneofthe\nlargest global providers of money transfer and payment services, and other significant remittance\ncompanies to serve them across countries in Latam, Africa and Asia. We also continued to ramp up\nvolumes with one of the main Asian commerce players, expanding the regions in which we serve them,\nandhavenowgoneliveinBrazilwithoneofthelargestglobalfintechcompanies,alsooutofAsia.\nMoving on to profitability, this quarter’s results showcase the resilience of our business model. We\nreached record gross profit of $78 million with net take rate stable at 1.2% since Q1 2024. This is a\nconsequence of our differentiated value proposition, continuous pursuit of cost efficiencies such as\nrenegotiation with processors, andtherealvalueinsolvingcomplexitiesacrossemergingmarketsforour\nglobal merchants, which grants pricing power and differentiates us from more commoditized payments\nofferings in the developed world. We achieve those results despite weakness in most emerging market\ncurrencies. From a currency perspective, applying constant currency growth rates across our main\nmarkets - Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Egypt and Nigeria - our gross profit would have been approximately\n6% higher during the third quarter 2024 or over 18% quarter-over-quarter growth and TPV growth would\nhavebeen14%quarter-over-quarter.\nOur Adjusted EBITDA reached $52 million, despite continued investments in our engineering team,\nback-office capabilities and our license portfolio, allcrucialforourlong-termsuccess.AlthoughAdjusted\nEBITDAwasdownyear-over-year,thisrepresentsthesecondconsecutivequarterofincreasedoperational\nleverage, with adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin now at 67%. This demonstrates the operational\nleverage inherent in our business model, general philosophy of expense control and disciplined\ninvestmenttodeliverourlong-termgrowthambitions.\nCash generation, another strength of our financial model, was also solid. During the past 3 months we\nhad net cashfromoperatingactivities,excludingmerchantfunds,lessCAPEXamountingto$26million,a\ncashconversionofpractically100%toNetIncome.\nNow I would like to cover some technology and product development deployments during the quarter,\nthat shed further light on what our core offering is, and how we differentiate from competitors. For\ncontext, always remember that the backdrop of where we operate is an emerging market landscape\nwherepaymentsarestillcharacterisedbythreemainfactors:fragmented,costly,andlowerperforming.\nDuring this quarter, we have launched our Smart Requests functionality, boosting our transaction\nperformance, therebyimprovingconversionratebyanaverageof1.22percentagepoints.Thismaysound\nminor but this actually represents in practical terms 1.2% additional revenue to our merchants. Smart\nrequests rely on per country machine learning models that optimise routing and chaining so as to\nmaximiseauthorizationrates.\nQ3 2024 Earnings - Transcript\nWe have also continued to develop increasingly advanced real-time cost calculation models to optimise\nprocessingcosts,whichalsocontributedtoourgrossprofitachievementandstablenettakerate.\nA thirdareaofinnovationhasbeenourlaunchofnewandpromisingalternativepaymentmethods(APM).\nAs part of ourongoingeffortstodeepenourinfrastructureinvariouscountriesandaddmorevaluetoour\nmerchants, we have successfully deployed integrations with Nupay in Brazil for global merchants. This\nrepresents an expansion of our payment method footprint with this widely adopted and advanced\nfeature-setAPM.\nFinally, we launched a new product to our suiteofofferings,astandalonePaymentOrchestrationoption,\nwhich allows merchants to retain our Smart Routing, fraud detection, and unified reporting, while\nobtaining their ownlicencesandcontractingdirectlywithprocessorsineachmarket.Althoughthismodel\nmay result in a lowernettakeratenetofacquiringcosts,itenhancesourabilitytocaptureshareofwallet\nwith relevant clients, and continues to add value to merchants through our single API connection and\nproductfunctionalities,whiledeliveringoptimisedconversionandcostresults.\nAll of these improvements to our platform, as well asthedevelopmentofnewsolutions,servetodeepen\nour competitive advantages in our markets, enhance the stickiness ofourproducts,andpotentiallybring\nfuturerevenuestreams.\nLastly,wecontinuetoinvestinexpandingourlicencesportfolio,obtaining(i)InternationalMoneyTransfer\nOperators licence in Nigeria; (ii) Financial System Auxiliary Services licence inEcuador;and(iii)Payment\nService Provider and Payment System Operator licences in Uganda.

Most of the year-over-year decline is explained by (i) Argentina, due to\nlower FX spreads following the currency devaluation in December 2023; and (ii) Brazil, given the repricing with\nour largest merchant which occurred in the first quarter of 2024 and share losses on credit cards, as explained\nbefore. Both effects were partially offset by Mexico, due to volume growth and lower processing costs from\nrenegotiations with processors in the first quarter of 2024. Sequentially, the growth was mainly driven by Mexico\nand Other Latam markets, where we experienced around US$2 million from widening FX spreads, that may\neventually fade away in the case of currencies devaluation. These positive factors were partially offset by (i)\nBrazil, as previously explained; and (ii) Argentina, as we had higher expatriation costs.\nAfrica and Asia gross profit increased by 49% year-over-year to US$22.6 million, accounting for the remaining\n29% of total gross profit. This annual comparison is explained by our overall growth in Egypt and ramp-up of our\ncommerce merchants in South Africa.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProfit for the period 26,811 40,364 90,768 120,605\nIncome tax expense 2,286 8,897 19,460 21,952\nDepreciation and amortization 4,438 3,237 12,289 8,621\nFinance income and costs, net 10,085 (1,548) (18,259) (10,398)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 6,204 3,322 17,441 7,072\nOther operating loss¹ 578 - 3,950 -\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets 8 (2,508) (93) (2,478)\nInflation adjustment 1,954 3,817 6,263 6,497\nOther non-recurring costs - - - 1,229\nAdjusted EBITDA 52,364 55,581 131,819 153,100\nNote: 1 The company wrote-off certain amounts related to merchants/processors off-boarded by dLocal.\n13 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1In 2022, the Company utilized FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) services for the repatriation of funds from one country. On November 11, 2022, when\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been\nprocessed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a\nthird-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and\na gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. In Q1 2024, the company has identified specific\ncollection entities from which it anticipates non-receipt of outstanding amounts.3 In Q4 2023, other non-recurring costs were related to class\naction expense, which included fees from independent global expert services. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report and class action expense, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included.\nUnaudited quarterly results.\nNote: 1Correspond to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel,\nindependent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\nNote: 1 XXXXX. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to\nclass action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting\nadvisory firm were included.\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal, Adjusted Net Income is defined as the profit for the\nperiod (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment\nnon-cash charges, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation (see detailed methodology\nfor Adjusted EBITDA on page 13). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to the fair value gain from the\nArgentine dollar-linked bonds, the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted\nto our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds, and the hedging cost associated with the Argentina treasury notes. In\naddition, it excludes the inflation adjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net\nIncome is a useful measure for understanding our results of operations while excluding certain non-cash effects such as\ncurrency devaluation, inflation, and hedging costs. Our calculation for Adjusted Net Income may differ from similarly-titled\nmeasures presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for our measure of\nprofit for the period as presented in accordance with IFRS.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income as reported 26,811 40,364 90,768 120,605\nInflation adjustment 1,954 3,817 6,263 6,497\nLoan - exchange difference 7,710 27,351 20,270 29,166\nArgentina Treasury Notes Hedging Costs 4,272 - 4,272 -\nFair value (loss) / gains of financial assets at FVTPL 95 (24,232) (33,494) (27,886)\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets 8 (2,508) (93) (2,478)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 6,204 3,322 17,441 7,072\nOther operating (gain)/loss 578 - 3,950 -\nOther non-recurring costs - - - 1,229\nTax effect on adjustments (4,227) 1,092 411 448\nAdjusted net income 43,405 49,206 109,788 134,653\nUnaudited quarterly results.\n14 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nEarnings per share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nOur diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group of dLocal by the\nweighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of common\nshares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential common shares into common shares.\nThe following table presents the information used as a basis for the calculation of our\nearnings per share:\nThree months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProfit attributable to common shareholders (USD) 26,782,000 40,308,000 90,734,000 120,449,000\nWeighted average number of common shares 282,212,297 289,411,641 291,582,333 292,058,528\nAdjustments for calculation of diluted earnings per\n14,108,758 16,620,498 15,154,672 16,509,161\nshare\nWeighted average number of common shares for\n296,321,055 306,032,139 306,737,005 308,567,689\ncalculating diluted earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share 0.09 0.14 0.31 0.41\nDiluted earnings per share 0.09 0.13 0.30 0.39\nThis press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in\nInternational Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by\nInternational Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one\ncontract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally\nwithout the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local\nentities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from any\nupselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant customers,\nand is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes revenue from\nnew customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come from existing\nmerchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for investors in order\nto assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing customer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\nRounding\nWe have made rounding adjustments to some of the figures included in this interim report. Accordingly,\nnumerical figures shown as totals in some tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that\npreceded them.\n17 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.

While the Company believes that our\nassumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable given currently available information, you are\ncautioned not to place undue reliance on those forward-looking statements.

The evolution of this key metric demonstrates our continued ability to grow as we\ngain share of wallet from our global merchant base and add new merchants to the mix as well. It also\nunderscores our unique value proposition as a trusted partner for some of the largest and most\nsophisticatedglobalcompaniesacrossemergingmarkets.\nThismomentumissolid,andourpipelineremainsrobust,bothwithinexistingmerchantopportunitiesand\nalsonewmerchantlogos,whichisapromisingleadingindicatoroflong-termgrowthpotential.Duringthis\nquarter we have started processing for a few more marquee global names, such as a leading global\nChinese fintech and one of the world's largest events and ticketing marketplaces. We also assisted\nmultiple existing merchants that are among the world's largest e-commerce players in their initialforays\ninto Africa, as they launched operations in South Africa during the last quarter, signalling our success\nQ2 2024 Earnings - Transcript\nacross the very promising African continent. Finally worth noting, we continue to power the growth of\ncross border payments in Brazil, being a part oftherecentlaunchofaglobalmarketplacepowerhousein\nthatmarket.\nThis $6 billioninTPVrepresentsa38%year-over-yeargrowth,despitethetoughcomparisonbasisof80%\ngrowth from the stellar second quarter of last year. Performance was good for us across multiple\nverticals, including continued strong growth in the commerce, on-demand delivery, and remittance\nverticals; accelerating growth from SaaS and Ride-Hailing merchants, which grew 72% and 51%\nrespectively year-over-year. This kind of sustained and well diversified TPV growth, with a focused\ncommitment to low-risk high-reputation verticals, sets us up well for long-term success. We believe that\nour year-over-year growth showcases a unique in class combination of growth while focusing on\nreputable verticals, which is unique among relevant comps base, who either grow less, over index\nhigh-riskverticals,ordoboth.\nNet take rates have held up sequentially, despite unfavourable events, like repricing by our largest\nmerchant at the beginning of the year, material currency devaluationsinNigeriaandEgyptmorerecently,\nandcontinuedweakeningacrossmostemergingmarketscurrencies.\nThis type of stable sequential pricing and growing TPV during the quarter translated to 11%\nquarter-over-quartergrossprofitgrowth.\nOur OPEX excluding non-cash share-based compensation, only grew byonly$1millionsequentially,after\nprevious quarters ofsequentialgrowthabove$4million,andthishappensasweadjustedourcashspend\ntotheweakergrossprofitthatbegantoflowthroughourP&L.AsI’vementionedpreviously,thereisalimit\nto how much we are willing to defend margins in the short term, as we are truly committed to certain\ninvestments, which are crucial for our long-term success, particularly those in our engineering pool,\nback-office capabilities and behind our licence portfolio. But, to balance this out, we are always revising\nother discretionary spending to make sure it matches our topline performance and is aligned with our\ngeneral philosophy of frugality. As a consequence of this, our Adjusted EBITDA reached $43 million,\nreflecting our still lean structure and disciplined spending, while our cash generation also accelerated\nversusthepriorquarter.\nThese highlights also come with certain challenges that we are focusedonrapidlyaddressing.Primarily,\nthe year-over-year gross profit performance was flat, drivenbyLatinAmericathatwasactuallydown13%\non Argentine FX devaluation; andtherepricingbyourlargestmerchantinBrazilandMexico.StellarAfrica\nand Asian gross profit growth of 79% year-over-year unfortunately did not suffice to offset those two\neventsinLatAm-stillourlargestregion.\nLet me wrap up my part by stating that, not only do we see more good than bad in the reportedquarter,\nbut, taking a step back from a short-term quarterly prism, dLocal is an incrediblystrongcompany,witha\nfantastic TAM, attractive business model and extremely promising future, that at some point will be\nreflectedincapitalmarketperformance.Tokeepthingsinperspective:\n● We maintainstrongproductmarketvalidationaswitnessedbynearly40%year-over-yearand14%\nquarter-over-quarterTPVgrowth;\n● Still run a highmarginfinancialmodelwithAdjustedEBITDAtoGrossProfitat60%+andabilityto\nscalefromheretopreviouslevelsgoingforward;\nQ2 2024 Earnings - Transcript\n● Cash conversion that remains very strong and growing, as EBITDA increases sequentially,witha\ncashconversioncyclethatisstillinthe100%rangeoverthelasttwelvemonths.\nWhen we analyse the potential of all this to compound over time,itishardtonotbeoptimisticaboutour\nfuture, despite the inherent challenges and volatility existent throughout the global south.

During the quarter, gross profit was $70 million, a slight\ndecreaseof1%year-over-year.\nStarting with LatAm, gross profit was $54 million, down 13% year-over-year. Most of this decline was\ndrivenbyArgentina,duetolowerFXspreadsfollowingthecurrencydevaluationinDecember2023.\nMexico also impacted LatAm gross profit, decreasing 17% year-over-year due to merchant repricing and\nlocal-to-local increase. Gross profit in Chile contracted 7% year-over-year due to lower cross-border\nvolumes. Other LatAm markets showed a 10% year-over-year increase in gross profit, driven by Tier 0\nmerchants’growth.\nIn Africa & Asia, gross profit grew 79% year-over-year, supported by (i) our overall growth in Egypt; (ii)\nramp-up of our merchants in South Africa, primarily in the commerce vertical, and (iii) temporary FX\ndynamicsinNigeria.\nGrossProfitQoQ\nOnaquarter-over-quarterbasis,grossprofitincreasedby11%.\nIn LatAm, gross profit increased by 10% quarter-over-quarter.

We are\nconfident that this type of efficient investment,giventheopportunitiesaheadofus,willpayoffinthemid\ntolongterm.\nWith that, total operating expenses reached$40millionforthequarter,anincreaseof72%year-over-year.\nOPEX,excludingshare-basedcompensationandcertainothernon-cashitems,grew46%.\nOPEX growth has a clear allocation tilt towards investments focused on Product Development & IT\ncapabilities.

However, our long-term view remains optimistic as I mentioned earlier. During our quarterly\nbottom-up review of our pipeline and existing contracts, where we project out share of wallet, probable\nmarket growth, and new commercial opportunities on a merchant-by-merchant basis, we are getting to\nthefollowingrevisedoutlookfor2024:\n- Our new TPV expectation is explained by lower probability of volumes ramp-up on certain\nmerchants, pipeline development skewed even more towards tier 0 merchants with lower take\nrates,andweakeremergingmarketscurrenciesexpectationsgoingforward;\n- For Gross profit, our forecast takes into consideration these impacts that I just mentioned for\nTPV, while also assuming a growth ofvolumesinourlocal-to-localflows,asourlocalbusinesses\ncontinuetothrive.\n- Our current expectation for Adjusted EBITDA reflects our desire of not wanting to slow down\ninvestments in certain key long term projects, and hence, the decision to not defend short term\nmargin structure as aggressively as we could givenourabilitytotightlycontrolcostsandflexible\ncosts structure. We need tocontinuehiringmoreITandproducttalent,strengtheningourinternal\ncontrols for the ever more complex business we manage, and investing in controlfunctionsthat\nprotect our merchants business and reputations across the global south.

Our commitment to our merchants and our expertise in the regions we operate,\nenable us to consistently win business from these global merchants. As we scale, this growth will help\nmitigate short-term volatility and dilute market fluctuations.

This quarter-over-quarter\ndecline was mostly driven by the currency devaluation in Nigeria and Egypt, despite the healthy TPV growth.\nGross profit was US$69.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, down 1% compared to US$70.8 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2023 and up 11% compared to US$63.0 million in the first quarter of 2024. The improvement in\ngross profit quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to (i) temporary FX dynamics in Nigeria; (ii) positive\nperformance of Argentina, Other LatAm and Other Africa and Asia countries; and (iii) Brazil, with lower processing\ncosts following renegotiation with processors, and change in payment mix, which partially offset the impact of key\nmerchant repricing (full impact in second quarter of 2024 versus two months in first quarter of 2024).\nAs a result, gross profit margin was 41% in this quarter, compared to 44% in the second quarter of 2023 and 34%\nin the first quarter of 2024.\nGross profit over TPV was at 1.2% decreasing from 1.6% in the second quarter of 2023 and flat compared to the\nQuarter (YoY) 2Q23 1Q24 2Q24\nfirst quarter of 2024, mainly due to FX dynamics in Nigeria and Egypt and renegotiation with processors in Brazil, QoQ Growth YoY Growth CAGR\nTPV $4.4 $5.3 $6.0 14% 38% 8%\nwhich combined were sufficient to offset the incremental sequential impact of the above-mentioned top merchant\nrepricing.

In this context, operating expenses grew by 72% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, Adjusted EBITDA $52 $37 $43 16% -18% -5%\nwith a clear allocation tilt towards investments focused on Product Development & IT capabilities; coupled with Net Income $45 $18 $46 161% 3% 1%\ninvestment to strengthen our back-office capabilities for future growth. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024,\nwe recorded an extraordinary US$1.6 million operating loss as we wrote-off certain amounts related to\nmerchants/processors off-boarded by dLocal.\nAs a result, Adjusted EBITDA was US$42.7 million , down 18% compared to US$52.0 million in the second quarter\nof 2023 and up 16% compared to US$36.8 million in the first quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 25%, compared to the 32% recorded in the second quarter of 2023 and 20% in the\nfirst quarter of 2024. On the annual comparison, the decrease is explained by the gross profit dynamics and our\ndecision to sustain many of the long-term investments, as previously mentioned. Following the same trend,\nAdjusted EBITDA over gross profit of 61% decreased compared to 74% in the second quarter of 2023 and\nincreased compared to 58% in the first quarter of 2024.\nNet financial income was US$28.0 million, compared to US$7.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 and US$0.3\nmillion in the first quarter of 2024.\nEffective income tax rate was 18%, compared to 16% in the second quarter of 2023 and 29% in the first quarter of\n2024, closer to levels of previous quarters.\n7 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 was US$46.2 million, or US$0.15 per diluted share, up 3% compared to\na profit of US$44.8 million, or US$0.15 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023 and up 161% compared to\na profit of US$17.7 million, or US$0.06 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. During the second quarter of\n2024, net income was mostly impacted by higher finance income, given the $23 million non-cash mark to market\neffect related to Argentine bonds investments used to hedge our local currency position in that market.\nAs of June 30, 2024, dLocal had US$531.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, including US$186.2 million of own\nfunds and US$345.4 million of merchants’ funds. The consolidated cash position decreased by US$17.8 million\nfrom US$549.4 million as of June 30, 2023. When compared to the US$572.4 million cash position as of March\n31, 2024, it decreased by US$40.7 million, mainly explained by the US$81.8 million of own funds used to buy back\nthe company’s own shares, in connection to the US$200 million Share Buyback Program announced in May 2024.\nThe following table summarizes our key performance metrics:\nThree months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\nKey Performance metrics (In millions of US$ except for %)\nTPV 6,035 4,373 38% 11,346 7,948 43%\nRevenue 171.3 161.1 6% 355.7 298.4 19%\nGross Profit 69.8 70.8 -1% 132.8 132.6 0%\nGross Profit margin 41% 44% -3p.p 37% 44% -7p.p\nAdjusted EBITDA 42.7 52.0 -18% 79.5 97.5 -19%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 25% 32% -7p.p 22% 33% -10p.p\nAdjusted EBITDA/Gross Profit 61% 74% -12p.p 60% 74% -14p.p\nProfit 46.2 44.8 3% 64.0 80.2 -20%\nProfit margin 27% 28% -1p.p -9p.p\n18% 27%\n8 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nSecond quarter 2024\nbusiness highlights\n2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, pay-ins TPV increased 34% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter to\nPO 1183.5 1189.2 1410.5 1653.0 1762.8\nUS$4.3 billion, accounting for 71% of the TPV.

The currency devaluation is also the main\ndriver of the sequential decrease.\nLatAm gross profit decreased by 13% year-over-year and increased by 10% quarter-over-quarter to US$53.5\nmillion, accounting for 77% of total gross profit. Most of the year-over-year decline is explained by Argentina,\ndue to lower FX spreads following the currency devaluation in December 2023. In the region, gross profit was\nalso impacted by Mexico, due to merchant repricing and local-to-local increase; and by Chile, given lower\ncross-border volumes. Other LatAm markets showed a 10% year-over-year increase in gross profit, driven by Tier\n0 merchants’ growth. Sequentially, the growth was mainly driven by the (i) growth in Argentina, and other LatAm\nmarkets, primarily Colombia and Costa Rica; and (ii) Brazil, with lower processing costs following renegotiation\nwith processors, coupled with change in payment mix. Those two factors partially offset the impact of a key\nmerchant repricing, with full impact in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2 months in previous one.\nAfrica and Asia gross profit increased by 79% year-over-year to US$16.3 million, accounting for the remaining\n23% of total gross profit. This annual comparison is explained by our overall growth in Egypt; ramp-up of our\nmerchants in South Africa, primarily in the commerce vertical; and temporary FX dynamics in Nigeria.\nSequentially, gross profit increased by 13%, attributable to temporary FX dynamics in Nigeria and growth in\nOther Africa and Asia.\nDuring the quarter, Revenue from Existing Merchants reached US$161.7 million compared to US$ 177.1 million\nin the first quarter of 2024. The quarter-over-quarter comparison was negatively affected by the currency\ndevaluation, as previously discussed, despite healthy volume growth. On the annual comparison, Revenue from\nExisting Merchants increased by 8% and the net revenue retention rate, or NRR, reached 100%, which was\nimpacted by Nigeria currency devaluation.\nRevenue from New Merchants accounted for US$9.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to US$\n11.2 million in the same quarter of the prior year.\n9 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24\nThe tables below present the breakdown of dLocal’s TPV by product and type of flow: PO 1071.7 1183.5 1189.2 1410.5 1653.0\nYoY 133% 114% 73% 47% 54%\nQoQ 11% 10% 0% 19% 17%\n% share 30% 27% 26% 28% 31%\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\nPI 2502.8 3189.8 3429.1 3700.8 3657.3\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share YoY 52% 70% 68% 59% 46%\nQoQ 7% 27% 8% 8% -1%\nPay-ins 4,273 71% 3,190 73% 7,930 70% 5,693 72%\n% share 70% 73% 74% 72% 69%\nPay-outs 1,763 29% 1,184 27% 3,416 30% 2,255 28% Total 3574.5 4373.4 4618.3 5111.2 5310.3\nCheck 7.73E-12 -1.27E-11 0 8.21E-05 0\nTotal TPV 6,035 100% 4,373 100% 11,346 100% 7,948 100%\n-20.73045863\nXB 1959.7 2219.3 2255.9 2235.1 2426.2\nYoY 51% 49% 46% 28% 24%\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June QoQ 12% 13% 2% -1% 9%\n% share 55% 51% 49% 44% 46%\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share\nL2L 1614.8 2154.1 2362.4 2876.1 2884.1\nCross-border 2,701 45% 2,219 51% 5,127 45% 4,179 53% YoY 101% 128% 99% 86% 79%\nQoQ 4% 33% 10% 22% 0%\nLocal to Local 3,334 55% 2,154 49% 6,219 55% 3,769 47%\n% share 45% 49% 51% 56% 54%\nTotal TPV 6,035 100% 4,373 100% 11,346 100% 7,948 100% Total 3574.5 4373.4 4618.3 5111.2 5310.3\n1.18E-11 -2.00E-11 2.00E-11 8.21E-05 0\nThe tables below present the breakdown of dLocal’s revenue by geography:\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share\nLatin America 138.7 81% 126.9 79% 264.1 74% 225.1 75%\nBrazil 42.3 25% 41.2 26% 85.3 24% 64.0 21%\nArgentina 20.5 12% 20.7 13% 34.3 10% 40.7 14%\nMexico 35.8 21% 28.3 18% 69.9 20% 51.0 17%\nChile 12.3 7% 14.2 9% 24.7 7% 28.4 10%\nOther LatAm 27.8 16% 22.5 14% 49.9 14% 41.0 14%\nAfrica & Asia 32.6 19% 34.3 21% 91.6 26% 73.3 25%\nNigeria 1.1 1% 20.4 13% 8.3 2% 47.3 16%\nEgypt 15.0 9% 4.7 3% 54.0 15% 8.1 3%\nOther Africa & Asia 16.5 10% 9.2 6% 29.2 8% 17.9 6%\nTotal Revenue 171.3 100% 161.1 100% 355.7 100% 298.4 100%\n10 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe tables below present the breakdown of dLocal’s gross profit by geography:\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share\nLatin America 53.5 77% 61.7 87% 102.1 77% 114.5 86%\nBrazil 19.2 28% 19.6 28% 37.1 28% 30.6 23%\nArgentina 7.6 11% 13.8 19% 12.8 10% 31.6 24%\nMexico 8.8 13% 10.6 15% 18.7 14% 17.5 13%\nChile 8.3 12% 8.9 13% 15.7 12% 18.0 14%\nOther LatAm 9.6 14% 8.7 12% 17.7 13% 16.8 13%\nAfrica & Asia 16.3 23% 9.1 13% 30.7 23% 18.1 14%\nNigeria 2.0 3% 0.2 0% 2.5 2% 2.6 2%\nEgypt 9.8 14% 4.2 6% 20.1 15% 6.9 5%\nOther Africa & Asia 4.5 7% 4.7 7% 8.1 6% 8.5 6%\nTotal Gross Profit 69.8 100% 70.8 100% 132.8 100% 132.6 100%\n11 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOperating\nacross 40+\ncountries in\nemerging\nmarkets\nSanto Domingo, D.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities. Finally, dLocal\nis unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA over\ngross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal cannot reliably predict certain of their necessary\ncomponents, such as impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProfit for the period 46,239 44,791 63,957 80,241\nIncome tax expense 10,060 8,774 17,174 13,055\nDepreciation and amortization 4,089 2,869 7,851 5,384\nFinance income and costs, net1 (28,045) (7,459) (28,344) (8,850)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 6,776 1,421 11,237 3,750\nOther operating loss2 1,553 - 3,372 -\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets 76 (21) (101) 30\nInflation adjustment 1,941 1,661 4,309 2,680\nOther non-recurring costs - - - 1,229\nAdjusted EBITDA 42,689 52,036 79,455 97,519\nNote: 1In Q2 2024, the Finance income and costs, net line was impacted by the non-cash mark to market effect related to Argentine bonds\ninvestments in the amount of US$22.8 million. 2In Q2 2024, the company wrote-off certain amounts related to merchants/processors\noff-boarded by dLocal.\n13 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1In 2022, the Company utilized FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) services for the repatriation of funds from one country. On November 11, 2022, when\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been\nprocessed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a\nthird-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and\na gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. In Q1 2024, the company has identified specific\ncollection entities from which it anticipates non-receipt of outstanding amounts.3 In Q4 2023, other non-recurring costs were related to class\naction expense, which included fees from independent global expert services. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report and class action expense, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included.\nUnaudited quarterly results.\nNote: 1Correspond to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel,\nindependent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\nNote: 1 XXXXX. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to\nclass action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting\nadvisory firm were included.\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal Adjusted net income is defined as the profit for the\nperiod (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment\nnon-cash charges, secondary offering expenses, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation\n(see detailed methodology for Adjusted EBITDA in page 13). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to\nthe fair value gain from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan\ndenominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds. In addition, it excludes the inflation\nadjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for\nunderstanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and\ninflation. Our calculation for Adjusted Net Income may differ from similarly-titled measures presented by other companies\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for our measure of profit for the period as presented in\naccordance with IFRS.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income as reported 46,239 44,791 63,957 80,241\nInflation adjustment 1,941 1,661 4,309 2,680\nLoan - exchange difference 5,831 1,815 12,560 1,815\nFair value (loss) / gains of financial assets at FVTPL (bonds) (22,774) (3,565) (33,589) (3,654)\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets 76 (21) (101) 30\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 6,776 1,421 11,237 3,750\nOther operating (gain)/loss 1,553 - 3,372 -\nOther non-recurring costs - - - 1,229\nTax on adjustments 5,998 (613) 4,638 (644)\nAdjusted net income 45,640 45,490 66,383 85,447\nNote: Adjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure.

The investor presentation will also\nbe filed on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.\nAbout dLocal\ndLocal powers local payments in emerging markets, connecting global enterprise merchants\nwith billions of emerging market consumers in more than 40 countries across Africa, Asia,\nand Latin America. Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one\ncontract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally\nwithout the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local\nentities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\nRounding\nWe have made rounding adjustments to some of the figures included in this interim report. Accordingly,\nnumerical figures shown as totals in some tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that\npreceded them.\n17 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking\nstatements convey dLocal’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, including\nguidance in respect of total payment volume, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit margin. Forward-looking statements regarding dLocal and amounts\nstated as guidance are based on current management expectations and involve known and\nunknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause dLocal’s actual results,\nperformance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances\nor achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Certain of these risks\nand uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and\n“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of dLocal’s filings\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, dLocal undertakes\nno obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect\ncircumstances or events after the date hereof. In addition, dLocal is unable to present a\nquantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal\ncannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment\ngains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\n18 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\ndLocal Limited\nCertain financial information\nConsolidated Condensed Interim Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three-month\nand six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\nThree months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContinuing operations\nRevenues 171,279 161,138 355,709 298,425\nCost of services (101,468) (90,378) (222,927) (165,828)\nGross profit 69,811 70,760 132,782 132,597\nTechnology and development expenses (6,408) (2,640) (11,873) (4,930)\nSales and marketing expenses (4,505) (3,106) (9,136) (7,963)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (27,074) (17,268) (51,406) (32,548)\nNet impairment losses on trade receivables (76) 21 101 (30)\nOther operating (loss)/gain (1,553) -

TPV growth was solid across many verticals, with Ecommerce nearly tripling,\nRemittances practically doubling, and Ride-hailing, SaaS, each growing north of 50% YoY. All this is a\ntestament to the value our solution offers merchants from varying verticals, and our increasingly strong\ncompetitive position and sustained SoW gains. We believe nothing sets us up better for long term\nsuccessthanthiskindofsustainedTPVgrowthcompoundingovermultipleyears.\nAs we move down our P&L, the quarter is less of a clear cut successthanourTPVgrowthindicates.We\ndelivered solid revenue growth, north of 30% YoY, while gross profit growth was flat YoY, leading to\ndecliningAdjustedEBITDA.\n1Q 2024 Earnings - Transcript\nMixedresultsduringthefirstquarterareexplainedbyafewrelevantdrivers.\nFirst, we saw one of our largest merchants achieve a new level in our tiered pricing scheme, and also\nre-negotiate fees, as their contract came up for renewal.

We have confidence our gross profit will rebound, and see these\nOPEX investments in capability building, internal mechanisms, and technology, as strategic for our long\ntermsuccess.\nTrendwise, performance got better as the quarter progressed, with a weak first two months of the year,\ntotalling$37M,whileMarchgrossprofitcameinat$25M,aboveQ4levels.\nMaria and Mark will now takeyouthroughgreaterdetailonourQ1resultsindetailinjustafewmoments;\nbutletmefirstspendsometimeprovidinganupdateonourexecutionagainstourexecutionpriorities.\nOur cross border businesses returned to 9% QoQ growth,andhitanewrecordof$2.4BinTPVduringthe\nfirst quarter, after witnessing declining growth in the fourth quarter driven by, among other things, a\ntemporary slowdown in XB transactions in Argentina. XB remains the core of our value proposition, and\nseeingareturntosequentialgrowthisagreatindicator.\nThe local to local processing business, despite being flat QoQ driven by seasonal effects, delivered TPV\ngrowth at nearly 80% YoY.

We continue to believe our growing portfolio ofregulatoryapprovalswill\nconstitute an increasing competitive advantage as our global merchants seek to navigate complex\nregulatoryenvironmentsinemergingmarkets.\nWiththat,I'llhanditovertoMariatotakeyouthroughamoredetailedoverviewofourfirstquarterresults.\nMariaOldham,SVPofCorporateDevelopment\nThankyouPedro.Goodafternooneveryone.\nAs Pedro just mentioned, during the first quarter we delivered strong TPV growth of 49% year-over-year\nand 4% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 5.3 billion dollars. Record TPV was achieved despite Q1 being\nseasonallyweakforourlargestvertical,e-commerce,andstrongdevaluations,mostnotablyinArgentina.\nFocusing on Revenue. During the quarter we experienced 34% YoY growth reaching 184 million dollars.\nThis growth was driven by continued strong performance in our most competitive markets: Brazil, with\nrevenues up 89% year-over-year; and Mexico, up 50% YoY. Alongside the growth inBrazilandMexico,we\nsaw a 20% YoY increase in Other LatAm including growth in Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic\nandEcuadorcomingfromstreaming,SaaS,on-demanddeliveryandride-hailingverticals.\nRevenue growth was negatively impactedbyArgentina,down31%YoY.TheannualArgentinacomparison\nis a tough one. First of all, the official rate has devalued more than 70%. Second, FX spreads have\ntightened, generating less fx revenues in our mix, combined with a higher proportion of L2L volume.\nFinally, Argentina also saw a decline in TPVgiventhatmanyofourmerchantshavepulledbackfromthat\nmarketgiventhemacroinstabilityofthelast12months.\nChile, was also a drag on YoY revenue growth, down 13% primarily due to customer churn at one of our\nfinancial services merchants. This is not that we lost a merchant, but that one of our major FS partners\nsaw their volumes in Chile decline significantly as they lost a key client for that market, negatively\naffectingourRevenuethere.\nIn Africa and Asia the main contributors of revenue growth were Egypt, South Africa, Turkey and\nPhilippines.Egyptgrowthwasdrivenby(i)thegeneralgrowthofourbusinessthere,withTPVup71%YoY,\n(ii) the wide spreads on FX rates between official and market rates, and (iii) our strong liquidity position\nforthatmarket,giventhatwehadasolidcombinationofXBPay-inandPay-outflowsduringthequarter.\nSouth Africa Revenue was driven by the expansion of twolargee-commercemerchantsintothatmarket:\none of these merchants grew volumes significantly during 2023, the other one is a merchant that we\nonboarded at the end of 2023andstartedprocessingvolumesinSouthAfricainthefirstquarterof2024,\nrapidlybecomingthesecondlargestmerchantintheregion.\nAnd finally the biggest drag on YoY revenue growth was Nigeria where revenues were down $20M over\nlast year, mostly driven by: (i) the tightening of spreads between market and official ratesaftertheNaira\n1Q 2024 Earnings - Transcript\ndevaluation in February 2024, generating less FX fees and (ii) higher proportion of L2L volumes in 1Q\n2024.\nNowletmegiveabriefoverviewofthekeydriversofQoQevolutionofRevenues.\nCompared to Q4 2023, revenue decreased by 2%. This sequential decline was mostly driven by\nseasonality, with Q4 being a very strong quarter for our ecommerce vertical. Additionally, we sawoneof\nourlargestmerchantsachieveanewlevelinourtieredpricingscheme,andalsore-negotiatefees,astheir\ncontract came up for renewal. As Pedro mentioned, given that our merchant concentration still remains\nhigh, such a renegotiationdirectlyimpactsrevenuegrowth.Thesetwofactorslargelyexplainthe14%and\n4%decreaseinBrazilandMexicorevenues,respectively.\nIn addition, we saw a decrease in revenues in Chiledrivenbylowervolumesfromsomemerchantsinthe\ncommerce vertical due to seasonality, compensated by higher volumes from financial services pay out\nflows,albeitatlowergrosstakeratecomparedtothecommercevolumes.\nThe lower revenues in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, were partially offset by Argentina, with revenues up 31%\nquarter-over-quarter, mainly explained by higher cross-border settlement.

Therefore, I'd like to walk you through in somegreaterdetail\nontheGPvariationweexperienced.\nDuring the quarter we experienced 2% YoY growth, to 63 million dollars. In LatAm gross profit was 49\nmillion dollars, decreasing 8% YoY. This result was significantly impacted by Argentina, with gross profit\ndown 71% YoY, given the lower FX revenue, as in the past we benefited from the wide FX spreads. This,\ntogether with the lower cross border share, explains the contraction in gross profit margin in Argentina\n1Q 2024 Earnings - Transcript\nfrom 89% a year ago to 37% in 1Q 2024. In 1Q 2023 Argentina corresponded to 29% of our gross profit\nandin1Q24,8%.\nExcluding Argentina, gross profit in LatAm grew 24% YoY, driven primarily by the strong performance in\nour most competitive markets with Brazil up 63% and Mexico up 44% YoY. Gross profit margin in Brazil\ncontracted 7pps YoY driven by: (i) recent renegotiation as explained by Pedro; (ii) growth of other Tier 0\nmerchants, and (iii) higher share of PO and L2L.

Thank you, Maria. I am delighted to be here today and very excited about our future\nprospectsaftermyinitialmonthatdLocal.\nWhile we will continue to invest in our capabilities, as Pedro mentioned in his opening remarks, we are\nalso lookingforwaystobemoreefficient acrossallareasofourbusiness.\nDuring the quarter we have continued to further invest in building out the team, capabilities, and\nestablishing processes and systems to support our long term growth ambitions. As a result of these\ninvestments, which we trust will pay off in the mid term, overall operating expenses reached 36 million\ndollars for the quarter. The main areas of expense increases QoQ were: tech-relatedexpenses,including\nengineers, software licences and infrastructure expenses; and salariesandwagesacrossouroperations,\ncompliance and finance teams. As a result, Operating expenses represented 57% of gross profit. For a\nmore detailed view, please refer to slide 16 from the accompanying earnings material. Let me also add\nthat our global team has grown to 951 people after adding 50-net FTEs during the quarter, with most of\nthehiresintech,salesandoperationsinUruguay,Argentina,BrazilandSpain.\nAll of thisresultedinanOperatingProfitof27milliondollarsforthequarter,down32%YoYand34%QoQ.\nSimilarly, Adjusted EBITDA came in at 37 million dollars, down 19% YoY and 25% QoQ with Adjusted\nEBITDA margin of 20%,down6percentagepointsQoQ.Approximatelyhalfofthisdecreasewasdrivenby\nthe gross profit compression discussed earlier and the other half by increased OperatingexpensesIjust\nmentioned.Alongthesamelines,theratioofAdjustedEBITDAtoGrossProfitwas58%forthequarter.\nNet income was 18 million dollars for the quarter, decreasing 50% YoY and 38% QoQ. The earnings\npresentation provides a detail of the QoQ evolution of net income which was mostly impacted by the\nlower EBITDA. In addition, our effective income tax rate increased to 29% from 21% last quarter, as a\nresultofthemixinrevenuesshiftingtowardshighertaxentities.\nMovingontocashflow,duringthequarterwegenerated12milliondollarsofFreeCashFlow(ownfunds).\nAnd with that Our net income to free cash flow conversion came in at 69% for the quarter.

The plan will expire on the earliest of May 2025 or upon\nreachingthe$200milliondollarrepurchaselimit.\nOur business continues to generate strong margins and solid cash conversion. This Share buyback\nprogramreflectswhereourcurrentcapitalallocationframeworkstands.\nWe are allocating a portion of that cash, as we have already mentioned a few times, towards\nstrengthening company capabilities by improving our internal systems and teams. This is seen in the\nmargincompressionintheshortterm inourP&L.\n1Q 2024 Earnings - Transcript\nOn the corporate development front, we will take a very disciplined approach, but should attractive\nopportunities arise, we still have an under leveraged balance sheet to deploy to complement our cash\nreserves.\nAnd finally, takingintoconsiderationthatcashgenerationshouldcontinuetobestronggoingforward, we\nare confident thisbuybackprogramrepresentsanaddedelementtothecapitalallocationframework.Itis\nan attractive use of capital given the trajectory we believe dLocal can have over time, as it executes\nagainst its enormous opportunity.

We manage and de-risk these variables as much as\npossible, but they still hold a level of unpredictability that is characteristic of emerging markets. That is\nsimplytherealityofourbusiness.\nWith that context in mind, weareworkingondeliveringonour2024planthatisalignedwiththeguidance\nthat we shared at the beginning of the year. At this point, and to the best of our current data and\nexpectations, we believe we are tracking towards those objectives, although with greater likelihood of\ncoming in towards the lower end of the issued ranges. Our mandate for theremainderof2024istoland\nandimproveonthat.\nShort term volatility aside, we are highly encouraged by our general progress, and remain incredibly\npositive on the bigger picture opportunity to compound profitable growth over the long term. Emerging\nmarkets still represent an unrivalled market opportunity for digital businesses, and payments remain a\nmajor friction point.

YoY revenue growth was\nnegatively impacted by Argentina, down 31% YoY. Lower revenues in Argentina were driven by several factors\nincluding more than 70% devaluation of the official rate; tighter FX spreads, combined with a higher proportion\nof local-to-local volume; in addition to lower TPV given that many of our merchants have pulled back from that\nmarket given the macro instability of the last 12 months. Nevertheless, we continue to see Argentina as a key\ngeography for our business and believe as the country stabilizes, it should come back to growth. Sequentially,\nLatAm revenue contracted by 5% mainly driven by seasonality, with Q4 being a very strong quarter for our\necommerce vertical, in addition to the new price tiering and renegotiation with one of our largest merchants.\nThese two factors largely explain the 14% and 4% quarter-over-quarter decreases in Brazil and Mexico\nrevenues, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by Argentina, that increased by 31%\nquarter-over-quarter, mainly driven by higher cross border settlements.\nAfrica and Asia revenue grew by 51% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to US$59.0 million,\naccounting for the remaining 32% of total revenue. Part of the growth was driven by Egypt with revenues\ngrowing by 11x year-over-year and 2x quarter-over-quarter. The growth in Egypt and other Africa and Asia more\nthan offset the -73% year-ver-year and -74% quarter-over-quarter decrease in Nigeria revenues mostly driven by:\n(i) the tightening of spreads between market and official rates after the Naira devaluation in February 2024, and\n(ii) higher proportion of L2L volumes and (iii) a sequential decline in TPV as our Financial Services vertical saw\na material drop in volume after the devaluation, with less fx trades occurring on our merchants’ platforms.\nLatAm gross profit decreased by 8% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter to US$48.6 million,\naccounting for 77% of total gross profit. This result was significantly impacted by Argentina, with gross profit\ndown 71% YoY, given the lower FX revenue, as in the past we benefited from the wide FX spreads, alongside\nlower cross border share. Excluding Argentina, gross profit in LatAm grew 24% YoY, driven primarily by the\nstrong performance in our most competitive markets with Brazil up 63% and Mexico up 44% YoY. Sequentially,\nthe contraction was mainly driven by Brazil due to the following drivers: (i) the previously mentioned key\nmerchant new price tiering and renegotiation, (ii) the ecommerce seasonality, and (iii) the increased pay-out\nmix.\nAfrica and Asia gross profit increased by 60% year-over-year to US$14.4 million, accounting for the remaining\n23% of total gross profit. This result was supported by a strong growth in Egypt with gross profit up 4x driven\nby our merchants' growth in that country. Similarly to Argentina, in Egypt we benefited from the wide spreads\nand our liquidity position having developed XB flows of pay-ins and pay-outs. The gross profit growth in Egypt\nwas partially offset by Nigeria, where gross profit was down 78% YoY as a consequence of a strong\ndevaluation of the Naira. Sequentially, gross profit decreased by 4%, also attributable to Nigeria.\n9 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24\nPO 1071.7 1183.5 1189.2 1410.5 1653.0\nDuring the quarter, dLocal continued delivering strong revenue growth both from existing and from new YoY 133% 114% 73% 47% 54%\ncustomers.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 31 of March\n2024 2023\nProfit for the period 17,718 35,450\nIncome tax expense 7,114 4,281\nDepreciation and amortization 3,762 2,515\nFinance income and costs, net (299) (1,391)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 4,461 2,329\nOther operating loss¹ 1,819 -\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets (177) 51\nInflation adjustment 2,368 1,019\nOther non-recurring costs² - 1,229\nAdjusted EBITDA 36,766 45,483\nNote: 1In Q1 2024, the company wrote-off certain amounts related to merchants off-boarded by dLocal. 2It includes non-recurring costs related\nto an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and forensic accounting advisory firm.\n13 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1In 2022, the Company utilized FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) services for the repatriation of funds from one country. On November 11, 2022, when\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been\nprocessed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a\nthird-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and\na gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. In Q1 2024, the company has identified specific\ncollection entities from which it anticipates non-receipt of outstanding amounts.3 In Q4 2023, other non-recurring costs were related to class\naction expense, which included fees from independent global expert services. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report and class action expense, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included.\nUnaudited quarterly results.\nNote: 1Correspond to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel,\nindependent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\nNote: 1 XXXXX. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to\nclass action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting\nadvisory firm were included.\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal Adjusted net income is defined as the profit for the\nperiod (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment\nnon-cash charges, secondary offering expenses, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation\n(see detailed methodology for Adjusted EBITDA in page 9). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to\nthe fair value gain from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan\ndenominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds. In addition, it excludes the inflation\nadjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for\nunderstanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and\ninflation. Our calculation for Adjusted Net Income may differ from similarly-titled measures presented by other companies\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for our measure of profit for the period as presented in\naccordance with IFRS.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 31 of March\n2024 2023\nNet income as reported 17,718 35,450\nInflation adjustment 2,368 1,019\nLoan - exchange difference 6,729 -\nFair value (loss) / gains of financial assets at FVTPL (bonds) (10,815) (89)\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets (177) 51\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 4,461 2,329\nOther operating (gain)/loss 1,819 -\nOther non-recurring costs - 1,229\nTax on adjustments (1,361) (31)\nAdjusted net income 20,742 39,958\n14 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nEarnings per share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted\naverage number of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-months period ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023.\nOur diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group of dLocal by\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average\nnumber of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential common shares into\ncommon shares.\nThe following table presents the information used as a basis for the calculation of our\nearnings per share:\nThree months ended 31 of March\n2024 2023\nProfit attributable to common shareholders (thousands USD) 17,708 35,444\nWeighted average number of common shares 296,093,840 295,125,862\nAdjustments for calculation of diluted earnings per share 14,028,247 16,441,184\nWeighted average number of common shares for calculating diluted earnings per share 310,122,087 311,567,046\nBasic earnings per share 0.06 0.12\nDiluted earnings per share 0.06 0.11\nThis press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in\nInternational Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by\nInternational Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one contract),\nglobal companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally without the\nneed to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local entities, and\nintegrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\n17 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.

Thank you.\nINTRODUCTION\nLooking back on 2023, dLocal is celebrating remarkable achievements. Within a span of 5 years, our company\nexperienced an extraordinary 14-fold expansion, achieving a record TPV of $18 billion, increasing by 67% YoY. This is\na testament to the trust our merchants, among the most demanding and sophisticated companies in the world, placed\nin our solution.\nMost of the growth has been fueled by our existing merchants as we continue to gain wallet share. The trust our\nmerchants place in our solution is also evidenced in our stellar NRR of 150%.\nWe are committed to unlocking the power of emerging markets. (pause)\nIn 2023, we enabled 154 million people in emerging markets to access global products and services. This is a 62%\nincrease compared to 2022.\nDuring 2023, we proudly served more than 600 merchants across 40 markets and we continued onboarding new\nmerchants to our platform. Of the world's leading technology companies by market cap, we serve 5 of the top 6.\nRevenue witnessed significant growth in Brazil (89%) and Mexico (72%), our most mature and highly competitive\nmarkets. Africa and Asia delivered an impressive 114% year-over-year increase.\nWe over-delivered on our revenue guidance, reaching $650M, +55% YoY. We remain focused on achieving gross profit\ngrowth, our key metric. Gross profit grew 37% YoY to $277 million. Our continued disciplined investment approach,\ncoupled with a focus on sustainable growth, has delivered another outstanding year with a Rule of 40 at an impressive\n4Q 2023 Earnings - Transcript\n110%. Our Adjusted EBITDA surpassed $200M in line with our guidance. Furthermore, we've maintained a best-in-class\nAdjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin of 73%, even amidst ongoing investments to support our long-term\nambitions.\nHow did we achieve these remarkable results?\nThrough our strategy, focus on execution, and our people. We efficiently grew our global team from 726 to 901 people,\nlocated across 49 countries.\nVery importantly, by continuing to be obsessed about our merchants and having them at the centre of everything we\ndo. We delivered innovative solutions and products, against highly demanding merchant needs. In 2023, our platform\nsolution gained traction, especially in marketplaces, expanding into 5 key markets in just one year. We have onboarded\nmore than 230,000 sellers on behalf of our merchants, in our marketplaces, with automated KYC capabilities, and\nflexible settlements for complex platform configurations.\nLast, and certainly not least, we are building upon our existing strengths by making investments in key capabilities,\nincluding growing our license portfolio, deepening our relationships with global banking partners, and ramping up our\noperations and back-office effectiveness. In 2023 alone, we were granted licenses in strategic markets, such as: Brazil,\nNigeria, Kenya and Rwanda, and registries in South Africa, Philippines, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, and Peru.\nAnd we are carrying this momentum forward. In 2024, we are relentlessly focusing on serving our customers and\nsolidifying our position as the preferred infrastructure solution for Global Merchants across Emerging Markets.\nWe are committed to making 2024 our most remarkable chapter yet!\ndLocal: built for success in emerging markets.\nQ4 2023 REMARKS\nPedro Arnt, co-Chief Executive Officer\nHi everyone. As the video illustrates, we just delivered an incredibly strong year that has finished on a high note with\nregards to increases in both TPV and revenue. As a growth company, these two metrics are really important to us, since\nthey reflect our merchants choices, remembering that our TPV is their revenue, and is the best indicator of our ability\nto capture and retain share of wallet. We think in terms of decades, not quarters. Over the long run, which is what we\nare focused on, consistent growth in these two metrics drive operational leverage, which in turn drives increased\nprofitability and cash flow, which is ultimately what generates shareholder value creation.\nNow let me walk you through a more short term view, reviewing our fourth quarter of 2023 results.\nWe delivered what we consider stellar TPV growth of 55% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 5.1\nbillion dollars; another quarterly record, proving our solution's strong competitive position.\nThe strong TPV performance we delivered translated into revenue growth of 59% YoY and 15% quarter-over-quarter\nreaching a record 188 million dollars. This growth was driven by very strong performance in our most competitive\nmarkets, Brazil, with revenues doubling year-over-year and up 12% QoQ, and Mexico, up 59% YoY and 18% quarter-over-\nquarter. Additionally, Nigeria revenues doubled year-over-year and increased by 3x quarter-over-quarter driven by the\nwidening spread between the official and the market exchange rates, which conversely, also resulted in higher\nexpatriation costs.\n4Q 2023 Earnings - Transcript\nThis strength in our biggest markets, combined with continued growth across other markets, was offset by a -26% YoY\nand -56% quarter-over-quarter contraction in Argentina. The weakness in Argentina was driven by two factors. First, a\nQoQ decline in our higher take rate cross border business as a consequence of tighter capital controls leading up to\nthe year end government transition, which resulted in what we believe to be a temporary shift towards more local to\nlocal settlement. Second, the country’s currency devalued significantly towards the end of the quarter, further affecting\nour performance in dollars, not unlike the impact felt by most other companies with relevant exposure to Argentina.\nDespite the short term headwinds, we continue with our long term view that Argentina is a relevant market for us and,\nmore importantly, for our merchants. In complexity, we thrive and we will continue to serve global merchants and\nconsumers in that market.\nThis impact carried over to the gross profit line, resulting in the quarterly decrease in total gross profit to 70 million\ndollars, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. However, if we exclude the Argentine segment, gross profit grew by 7% quarter-\nover-quarter. When we go to a year-over-year basis, gross profit grew by a sound 27% or by a very strong 48% when we\nexclude Argentina.\nOur net take rate decreased during the quarter by 25 bps QoQ to 1.4%, as a result of shifts in business mix, with lower\nshare of pay-ins and cross-border volumes. We believe that these results indicate that, although downward pressure\non take rates continues as we have repeatedly signalled, it is happening at a slow pace, and more importantly driven\nprimarily by mix shift, as we still continue to see limited pricing pressure derived from competitive dynamics.\nLet’s move on to our OPEX structure. During the quarter we continued to invest further in building out our team and\nestablishing processes and systems to support our long term growth ambitions. As a consequence of these\ninvestments, overall OPEX increased to 29 million dollars. The main areas of expense increases were: (i) tech related\nexpenses, including engineers, software licences and other IT and technology security expenses; (ii) non IT salaries\nand wages as we continue to strengthen our team, including important leadership positions; and (iii) office expenses\nas we’ve grown our global footprint. Overall OPEX represented 41% of gross profit, compared to 31% in Q3 2023. For a\nmore detailed view, see slide 18 from the accompanying earnings material. I’d like to stress that we are convinced that\nthese investments in technology, product and people are very relevant to continue building a sustainable, high growth\nbusiness. As we continue to gain scale, we expect to see operating leverage in the mid term.\nAs we go down the P&L, all this resulted in Adjusted EBITDA of 49 million dollars, up by 22% YoY while down by 11%\nQoQ. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted QoQ to 26%, primarily driven by previously noted gross profit compression.\nDespite the slowdown in Adjusted EBITDA, we continue to deliver best-in-class profitability. Our ratio of Adjusted\nEBITDA to Gross Profit came in at 71% for the quarter, notwithstanding the investments undertaken I just walked you\nthrough.\nNet income totaled 28 million dollars during the quarter, growing by 47% YoY. Sequentially, it decreased by 29% QoQ.\nAs detailed in the accompanying presentation, the quarterly evolution of net income was negatively affected by lower\nEBITDA, inflation adjustments under IFRS, which are accounting impacts, and increased stock based compensation.\nWe also observed an increase in our effective income tax rate, from 18% in Q3 to 21% in Q4, as a result of higher local-\nto-local share of pre-tax income and the fact that the IFRS inflation adjustments are non-deductible.\nMoving on to cash flow, during the quarter we generated 36 million dollars of Free Cash Flow (own funds) and 166\nmillion dollars during the year. Our net income to free cash flow conversion continued to be above 100%. Strong own\nfunds cash flow generation was mainly driven by the net income profile of our financial model and also by the recovery\nof 13 million dollars of the restricted cash we held as guarantees for standby letters of credit. During Q4, we also used\npart of our own funds to acquire an additional 16 million dollars in Argentine dollar-linked treasury bonds, in order to\nsuccessfully hedge against FX exposure in that market.\nConsequently, we ended the year with a robust liquidity position of 326 million dollars including 223 million dollars of\navailable cash for general corporate purposes and 103 million dollars of short term investments. We remain committed\n4Q 2023 Earnings - Transcript\nto evaluating opportunities to take advantage of our differentiated financial profile, that combines profitable growth\nwith very strong cash generation, which allows us to explore (i) inorganic growth, (ii) possible buybacks, and (iii)\ninstituting a dividend policy.\nOverall, we are very proud of what we achieved in 2023 and we are also excited about our outlook for 2024 and even\nbeyond. As I said before, I came to dLocal with the strong belief this is an outstanding business with significant\nopportunities ahead. That conviction has done nothing but increase in my time here.\nAs a team we remain focused on capturing the huge market opportunity ahead of us by continuing to execute our land-\nand-expand strategy with our merchants, maximising opportunities and gaining share of wallet from them. We will\ncontinue investing behind and tightening foundations for future growth because we trust that there will be a lot of future\ngrowth. First of all, we will further strengthen the dLocal team, investing in human capital, with a particular emphasis\non the engineering pool. Second, we will further upgrade our back office capabilities and third, we want to continue\ninvesting behind our licence portfolio throughout emerging markets, which we are convinced can become a unique\nasset in coming years. On this last point, it is worth pointing out that we were granted incremental licences and\nregistries across 10 markets during 2023 as the initial video shows. These three factors will contribute to further\nwidening our competitive position over the long run.\nI’d like to now hand it over to Maria who will walk you through how everything I’ve just outlined for you translates in\nterms of our financial outlook for 2024.\nMaria Oldham, SVP of Corporate Development\nThank you Pedro. Good morning everyone. I would like to share our expectations for the full year 2024.\nWe are adding TPV expectations this year, as we believe this is the most relevant operational metric for our Company.\nIt is the cleanest indicator of market share. As we mentioned earlier, ultimately our merchants choose us by routing\nmore and more volume through our systems than other alternatives they may have.\nWe are guiding for TPV growth of 40% to 50%, surpassing 26 billion dollars of TPV at the midpoint.\nAs we currently see things, incremental volume growth will be back ended in the year, starting off at a similar level to\nhow we exited 2023 and picking up pace as the year progresses, given our growth in the highly seasonal ecommerce\nvertical, and how we currently see our late stage pipeline panning out.\nThis strong TPV growth will be driven mainly by increased share of wallet from existing merchants and continued\nscaling of tier 0 merchants. We continue to benefit from structural tailwinds associated with the digital economy and\nthe growth of the middle class in emerging markets.\nAfrica and Asia are expected to grow at a faster pace, signaling the long term potential for global growth.\nVerticals with most expected growth are: e-commerce, advertising, and ride hailing.\nAs we always emphasise, our main financial focus is on maximising absolute dollar gross profit growth. Thus, we\ndecided to guide for gross profit instead of revenue as we believe this metric better reflects how we run our business.\nWe see gross profit for 2024 between 320 and 360 million dollars.\nOur gross profit range assumes:\n1. increased mix coming from Tier 0 merchants as we continue to ramp up those global relationships, driving\nincremental TPV and wallet share from the world's leading tech companies, but at lower take rates.\n2. sustained growth in our local to local business. We see this as validation of our orchestration approach to\n4Q 2023 Earnings - Transcript\npayments, and proves that we are competitive versus local acquirers.\n3. normalisation, or tightening of fx spreads in certain dual currency rate markets such as Argentina and Egypt\nthat generated windfall benefits in 2023. Despite the tightening of FX spreads being a headwind for our 2024\nplan, it also represents a more sustainable and lower risk gross profit profile.\n4. and mix of growth shifting to less mature markets, where we haven’t scaled yet.\nFinal guidance is on Adjusted EBITDA. We are committed to running a financial model that combines robust mid term\nGross Profit growth with an EBITDA margin that is among the best in our comp set. This is our model of highly profitable\ngrowth. As such we are re-affirming our mid term guidance of:\na. 25% - 35% Gross Profit growth\nb. 75%+ Adjusted EBITDA to Gross Profit margin\nThe trajectory towards that mid-term guidance comes in for 2024 at around 70% Adjusted Ebitda to Gross Profit. This\nis an Adjusted Ebitda of 220 to 260 million dollars.\nWe foresee OPEX increasing around 45% YoY. When compared to Q4 run rate, OPEX growth will be around 25%, despite\na 2X growth rate expected for TPV in 2024, confirming the operational leverage existent in our business model, and\nindicating that much of the incremental OPEX spend necessary for the long-term growth has already been incurred\nduring H2 2023.\nThis growth in YoY OPEX will be driven primarily by tech investments, as we aim to grow our talent pool by around 50%.\nOther main areas of OPEX growth will include Sales and Operations.\nAs our short term guidance indicates, we are investing with discipline, so as to not deviate significantly from our mid-\nterm margin guidance. And, by reiterating our mid term outlook, as we look beyond 2024, we are signalling that once\nwe conclude our short term investment cycle in tools, processes, and people to secure our ability to scale the company\nfor long-term growth, we believe we will start to see the operational leverage inherent to our business model kick in\neven more clearly.\nAs mentioned in the opening remarks, that kind of scaling is what generates the cash flows that drive shareholder value\ncreation over time. The clear potential of dLocal becomes obvious if one compounds our growth in line with our mid\nterm targets, over a multi year period.\nLet me now hand it over to Seba.\nSebastian Kanovich, co-Chief Executive Officer\nIn my carefully planned transition that has been unfolding since August, Pedro is now set to take on the role of sole\nCEO.\nMy commitment to dLocal remains strong, and I will actively lead the newly established Commercial and M&A\nCommittee as part of the company's board of directors.\nOver the past few months, Pedro and I have not only worked together but learned from each other, capitalising on our\ncomplementary skills to enhance the company's performance, especially in navigating intricate situations.\nAs we progress to the next phase of our transition plan, emphasising efficiency in daily decision-making, we are\nconfident that Pedro is the ideal person to oversee dLocal's day-to-day operations. His instrumental role in scaling one\nof the most successful emerging market technology companies speaks volumes about his capabilities.\nPedro's focus will be on the ongoing mission of \"company building,\" while my attention turns towards identifying pivotal\ngrowth opportunities for dLocal in the future.\n4Q 2023 Earnings - Transcript\nNow, I'll hand it back to Sergio to unveil further details about upcoming management changes.\nSergio Fogel, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer\nHi everyone. Thank you, Seba, for sharing this news with us. On behalf of dLocal's Board of Directors and the\nshareholders, I express our deep gratitude for your significant contributions to our company since inception. Working\nwith you has been and will continue to be an absolute pleasure. Witnessing your journey, steering dLocal from its\nhumble beginnings to a thriving startup in Latin America, and now to a global powerhouse, fills me with pride.\nAs we move forward, we anticipate a shift in the leadership style needed by the company, according to the various\nstages in its evolution. The challenges of 2023 prompted a defensive approach, leading to operational consolidation.\nWith these changes now on track, we are transitioning to an offensive strategy. Our focus is on re-accelerating our long\nterm growth prospects through a combination of innovation with new product launches, expanded coverage in high\npotential verticals and growing our Commercial team to ensure it is fit for purpose, and when the right opportunities\narise, inorganic growth through M&A. Sebastian's pivotal role in leading the newly constituted Commercial, Business\nDevelopment & M&A Committee will be instrumental in executing this more assertive strategy, geared towards long-\nterm value creation for our shareholders.\nIn my capacity as founder, principal shareholder, and active manager, it's immensely gratifying to observe Pedro, Seba,\nand the Board collaborating to navigate this transition seamlessly. Our unwavering objective remains to preserve the\ncore values and the capabilities that fueled our growth while embracing new opportunities as we scale into a much\nlarger organisation that can best serve our merchants throughout emerging markets. We firmly believe in this strategy.\nAs proof of this, during 2023, as the main shareholders of the company, we have bought back 160 million dollars worth\nof dLocal shares, showing our confidence in the long-term success of the business.\nIn many ways, I see myself as the custodian of our company's legacy and culture, steering the course to maintain\ncontinuity while also bridging the path towards the essential changes that will secure our future success.\nWith this, let me hand it over back to Pedro.\nPedro Arnt, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Sergio. As we reconfigure our leadership structures, I am also pleased to announce the newest addition to our\nteam.\nMark Ortiz will be joining the company as Chief Financial Officer, starting his role in April, overseeing various functions\nwithin dLocal.\nAs we continue our upward trajectory, we sought a robust financial leader capable of guiding us through the next phase\nof our growth trajectory. Mark brings a wealth of experience in that sense, boasting over 30 years of senior financial\nleadership, primarily at GE Capital, where he held roles as Global FP&A Leader, and Global Controller across multiple\ndepartments. Mark's extensive background includes not only key financial expertise that fit to our current requirements,\nbut also working assignments across over 20 markets, making him well suited for the global complexity that our\ncompany presents.\nI trust Mark is the optimal CFO choice to propel us to the next level of growth and reinforce our standing as a frontrunner\nin payment solutions for emerging markets. I hope everyone has the chance to meet Mark over the coming years and\nshare the same enthusiasm we have with his arrival.\n4Q 2023 Earnings - Transcript\nI also want to make sure we all extend our gratitude to Diego Cabrera Canay for his invaluable contributions to dLocal.\nDiego played a pivotal role in establishing numerous finance functions at the company, prepping it for substantial\ninternational expansion and growth, and guiding the company through its public listing process. Over the last 3 and a\nhalf years, Diego has been the steward of a business that has grown 10X in TPV, opened over 20 country operations,\nand multiplied its market cap by 4X. We wish Diego the best.\nIn summary, I would like to thank our global team, our valued customers, and our investors for their continued support.\nAnd before we head back to your questions, I’d like to wrap up today's prepared remarks with one last thought. 2023\nwas a watershed year for dLocal. Despite facing significant market tests and macro challenges, we believe we have\ndemonstrated the resilience of both our value proposition to our merchants and also of our business model, persistently\ngrowing and thriving through turbulent times. We believe we emerge strengthened and focused on tapping into the\nimmense business opportunity ahead of us. We are committed to realising the long-term company purpose of\nunlocking the potential of emerging markets. What we mean by this is building a bridge between the growing base of\nbillions of consumers in the Global South and the products and services they demand, but that until very recently were\nexclusive to the minority of consumers who had access to payment mechanisms from developed markets. And as we\naccomplish this mission of closing the digital divide for emerging market consumers, we are also tapping into the\nincredibly attractive long term market opportunity that is the one that underlies the investment thesis in dLocal. I look\nforward to giving you updates on our progress along this journey as the quarters evolve."

(“FTX”) services for the repatriation of funds from one country. On November 11, 2022, when FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the\nCompany had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been processed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5\nmillion. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and a gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance.3 Other non-recurring costs related to class action expense, which include fees from independent global expert 19\nservices. 4During Q4 2023 we recognized a fair value gain of $50.8 million ($24.2 million in Q3 2023) from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and an exchange difference loss of $51.9 million (-$27.4 million in Q3 2023) from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted\nto our Argentine subsidiary to purchase part of these bonds.\nStrong balance sheet position; with own funds cash\nconversion > 100%\nConsolidated cash reconciliation ($M)\nRobust own liquidity of\n+$38M\n$326M: $223M own cash +\n+$50M $103M short-term\ninvestments (Argentine\ndollar-linked bonds)\nStrong FCF1 (own-funds)\nRecovery of the Further investments in\nrestricted cash mainly Argentine dollar-linked generation of $166M in\nheld as guarantees bonds to hedge own\nFY23 before bonds and\nfor standby letters of 313 cash against\nMerchants 306 credit devaluation 3 31 13 3 share buyback with 111%\nfunds cash conversion2 ($36M and\n126% in Q4)\nNote: 1FCF (own-funds) is calculated as profit before\nincome tax less income tax paid, +/- non cash\nOwn 235 adjustments, +/- change in working capital (own)\n192 223 excluding movements in Other Assets +/- net collection\nfunds of interest & financial expenses, less additions of\nproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\nFCF excludes inflows & outflows due to movements in\nOther Assets, because these movements are expected\nto be non-recurring and temporary. 2Cash conversion is\ncalculated as Free Cash Flow (own-funds) divided by net\nincome\n20\n20\nFull year 2024 outlook\nTPV Gross Profit Adjusted EBITDA\n$25-27B $320-360M $220-260M\nPLACEHOLDER FOR\nGUIDANCE\n● The respective midpoints imply\n● Growth driven by increased ● Growth of “Tier 0” merchants\nAdjusted EBITDA over gross\nshare of wallet from existing\n● Sustained growth in our local to profit of around 70%\nTPV $2.4-2.5B merchants local business\n● Higher temporary OPEX increase\n● Increasing share from Africa\n● Growth expected from regions as we prepare the business for\nand Asia\nthat we have not fully scaled yet long term growth\n● High growth expected from:\nGross profit $340-370M ● Normalization of foreign ● Investments primarily in tech and\ne-commerce, advertising, and\nexchange spreads in certain product headcount.

It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to the fair value gain from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and the exchange difference loss from the\nintercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds. In addition, it excludes the inflation adjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary\neconomies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for understanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and inflation.

Despite what we view as short term headwinds, we continue with our long term\nview that Argentina is a relevant market for us and our merchants.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities. Finally, dLocal\nis unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA over\ngross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal cannot reliably predict certain of their necessary\ncomponents, such as impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 31 of December Twelve months ended 31 of December\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nProfit for the period 28,481 19,364 149,086 108,697\nIncome tax expense 7,476 3,935 29,428 11,586\nDepreciation and amortization 3,604 2,457 12,225 8,147\nFinance income and costs, net (996) 3,071 (11,394) 6,590\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 4,850 3,810 11,922 8,684\nOther operating (gain)/loss - (9) - 697\nSecondary offering expenses¹ - - - 89\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets2 (657) 5,640 (3,135) 5,534\nInflation adjustment 6,040 132 12,537 1,037\nOther non-recurring costs3 434 2,014 1,663 2,014\nAdjusted EBITDA 49,232 40,414 202,332 153,075\nNote: 1Corresponds to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2In 2022, the\nCompany utilized FTX Trading Ltd.

In addition, it excludes the inflation\nadjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for\nunderstanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and\ninflation.

In this sense, the financial statements of the Argentinian subsidiaries\nwere restated to reflect the purchasing power of the currency and therefore a gain on net monetary position arose. 2During Q4 2023 we recognized a fair value\ngain of US$ 50.8 million (US$24.2 million in Q3 2023 and US$ 3.6 million in Q2 2023) from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and an exchange difference loss of\nUS$ 51.9 million (-S$ 27.4 million in Q3 2023 and -US$ 1.8 million in Q2 2023) from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine\nsubsidiary to purchase part of the bonds. 3We calculated the tax impact on all adjustments based on their corresponding tax rate.\n13 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nEarnings per share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted\naverage number of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-months and twelve-month periods\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOur diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group of dLocal by\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average\nnumber of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential common shares into\ncommon shares.\nThe following table presents the information used as a basis for the calculation of our\nearnings per share:\nThree months ended 31 of December Twelve months ended 31 of December\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nProfit attributable to common shareholders (thousands USD) 28,515 19,357 148,964 108,683\nWeighted average number of common shares 290,657,015 295,455,429 291,982,305 295,623,703\nAdjustments for calculation of diluted earnings per share 5,008,261 17,783,776 10,976,123 17,514,944\nWeighted average number of common shares for calculating\n295,665,276 313,239,205 302,958,428 313,138,646\ndiluted earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share 0.10 0.07 0.51 0.37\nDiluted earnings per share 0.10 0.06 0.49 0.35\nThis press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in\nInternational Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by\nInternational Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The quarterly financial information\nin this press release has not been audited, whereas the annual results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and\nas of December 31, 2022 are audited.\n14 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOutlook full year 2024\nWe are including TPV guidance this year, as we believe this is the most relevant operational metric for the\ncompany and the cleanest indicator of market share. Additionally, along with adjusted EBITDA and as we always\nemphasize, we also focus on maximizing absolute dollar gross profit growth. Thus, we decided to guide for\ngrowth profit as well.\nAs outlook for the full year 2024, we expect to grow our TPV to between US$25 to US$27 billion and gross profit\nto between US$320 and US$360 million in 2024. Our expectations for TPV and gross profit assume increased\nmix coming from “Tier 0” merchants as we continue to ramp-up those global relationships, driving incremental\nTPV and wallet share from the world's leading tech companies, but at lower take rates. In addition, we see\nsustained growth in our local to local business, and mix of growth shifting to less mature markets, where our\noperations have not reached scale. Our gross profit outlook assumes normalization of foreign exchange spreads\nin certain dual currency rate markets.\nIn terms of profitability, we expect Adjusted EBITDA between US$220 to US$260 million and Adjusted EBITDA\nover gross profit margin around 70%.\nWe are committed to running a financial model that combines robust mid term gross profit growth with an\nEBITDA margin that is best-in-class. As such we are re-affirming our mid term outlook of: 1) 25%-35% gross profit\nCAGR growth and 2) 75%+ Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin. Our 2024 outlook implies a temporary\ndeviation from mid-term guidance as we prepare the business for sustainable long term growth. In 2024, we will\ninvest primarily in tech, mostly to grow our tech team, followed by investments in operations and sales. As we\nlook beyond 2024, once we conclude our short term investment cycle in tools, processes, and people, we believe\nwe will start to see the operational leverage inherent to our business to kick in.\nFY2023 FY2024 Outlook range YoY Growth range\nTPV (US$ billion) 18 25-27 40-50%\nGross profit (US$ million) 277 320-360 15-30%\nAdjusted EBITDA (US$ million) 202 220-260 10-30%\nOutlook amounts for the full year 2024 are estimates and are based on current management expectations.\nAmounts are subject to change and we undertake no duty to update this outlook.\n15 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nConference call and webcast\ndLocal’s management team will host a conference call and audio webcast on March 19th,\n2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one contract),\nglobal companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally without the\nneed to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local entities, and\nintegrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\n17 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking\nstatements convey dLocal’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, including\nguidance in respect of total payment volume, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit CAGR\nand Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin. Forward-looking statements regarding dLocal\nand amounts stated as guidance are based on current management expectations and involve\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause dLocal’s actual\nresults, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,\nperformances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nCertain of these risks and uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking\nStatements” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of\ndLocal’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law,\ndLocal undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to\nreflect circumstances or events after the date hereof. In addition, dLocal is unable to present a\nquantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal\ncannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment\ngains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\n18 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\ndLocal Limited\nCertain financial information\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three-month and twelve-month\nperiods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\nThree months ended 31 of December Twelve months ended 31 of December\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nContinuing operations\nRevenues 188,005 118,428 650,351 418,925\nCost of services (118,286) (63,326) (373,492) (216,758)\nGross profit 69,719 55,102 276,859 202,167\nTechnology and development expenses (4,024) (1,607) (12,650) (6,348)\nSales and marketing expenses (4,710) (3,891) (17,120) (13,335)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (20,641) (17,471) (70,567) (48,343)\nImpairment (loss)/gain on financial assets 657 (5,640) 3,135 (5,534)\nOther operating (loss)/gain -

On November 11, 2022, when\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been\nprocessed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a\nthird-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and\na gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. In Q1 2024, the company has identified specific\ncollection entities from which it anticipates non-receipt of outstanding amounts.3 In Q4 2023, other non-recurring costs were related to class\naction expense, which included fees from independent global expert services. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report and class action expense, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included.\nUnaudited quarterly results.\nNote: 1Correspond to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel,\nindependent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\nNote: 1 XXXXX. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to\nclass action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting\nadvisory firm were included.\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal, Adjusted Net Income is defined as the profit for the\nperiod (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment\nnon-cash charges, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation (see detailed methodology\nfor Adjusted EBITDA on page 13). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to the fair value gain from the\nArgentine dollar-linked bonds, the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted\nto our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds, and the hedging cost associated with the Argentina treasury notes.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one\ncontract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally\nwithout the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local\nentities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from any\nupselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant customers,\nand is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes revenue from\nnew customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come from existing\nmerchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for investors in order\nto assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing customer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\nRounding\nWe have made rounding adjustments to some of the figures included in this interim report. Accordingly,\nnumerical figures shown as totals in some tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that\npreceded them.\n17 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking\nstatements convey dLocal’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, including\nguidance in respect of total payment volume, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit margin. Forward-looking statements regarding dLocal and amounts\nstated as guidance are based on current management expectations and involve known and\nunknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause dLocal’s actual results,\nperformance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances\nor achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Certain of these risks\nand uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and\n“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of dLocal’s filings\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, dLocal undertakes\nno obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect\ncircumstances or events after the date hereof. In addition, dLocal is unable to present a\nquantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal\ncannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment\ngains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\n18 3rd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\ndLocal Limited\nCertain financial information\nConsolidated Condensed Interim Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three-month\nand nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\nThree months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContinuing operations\nRevenues 185,774 163,921 541,483 462,346\nCost of services (107,594) (89,378) (330,521) (255,206)\nGross profit 78,180 74,543 210,962 207,140\nTechnology and development expenses (6,930) (3,696) (18,803) (8,626)\nSales and marketing expenses (6,892) (4,447) (16,028) (12,410)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (22,636) (17,378) (74,042) (49,926)\nImpairment reversal on financial assets (8) 2,508 93 2,478\nOther operating losses (578) -

This quarter-over-quarter\ndecline was mostly driven by the currency devaluation in Nigeria and Egypt, despite the healthy TPV growth.\nGross profit was US$69.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, down 1% compared to US$70.8 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2023 and up 11% compared to US$63.0 million in the first quarter of 2024. The improvement in\ngross profit quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to (i) temporary FX dynamics in Nigeria; (ii) positive\nperformance of Argentina, Other LatAm and Other Africa and Asia countries; and (iii) Brazil, with lower processing\ncosts following renegotiation with processors, and change in payment mix, which partially offset the impact of key\nmerchant repricing (full impact in second quarter of 2024 versus two months in first quarter of 2024).\nAs a result, gross profit margin was 41% in this quarter, compared to 44% in the second quarter of 2023 and 34%\nin the first quarter of 2024.\nGross profit over TPV was at 1.2% decreasing from 1.6% in the second quarter of 2023 and flat compared to the\nQuarter (YoY) 2Q23 1Q24 2Q24\nfirst quarter of 2024, mainly due to FX dynamics in Nigeria and Egypt and renegotiation with processors in Brazil, QoQ Growth YoY Growth CAGR\nTPV $4.4 $5.3 $6.0 14% 38% 8%\nwhich combined were sufficient to offset the incremental sequential impact of the above-mentioned top merchant\nrepricing.

In this context, operating expenses grew by 72% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, Adjusted EBITDA $52 $37 $43 16% -18% -5%\nwith a clear allocation tilt towards investments focused on Product Development & IT capabilities; coupled with Net Income $45 $18 $46 161% 3% 1%\ninvestment to strengthen our back-office capabilities for future growth. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024,\nwe recorded an extraordinary US$1.6 million operating loss as we wrote-off certain amounts related to\nmerchants/processors off-boarded by dLocal.\nAs a result, Adjusted EBITDA was US$42.7 million , down 18% compared to US$52.0 million in the second quarter\nof 2023 and up 16% compared to US$36.8 million in the first quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 25%, compared to the 32% recorded in the second quarter of 2023 and 20% in the\nfirst quarter of 2024. On the annual comparison, the decrease is explained by the gross profit dynamics and our\ndecision to sustain many of the long-term investments, as previously mentioned. Following the same trend,\nAdjusted EBITDA over gross profit of 61% decreased compared to 74% in the second quarter of 2023 and\nincreased compared to 58% in the first quarter of 2024.\nNet financial income was US$28.0 million, compared to US$7.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 and US$0.3\nmillion in the first quarter of 2024.\nEffective income tax rate was 18%, compared to 16% in the second quarter of 2023 and 29% in the first quarter of\n2024, closer to levels of previous quarters.\n7 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 was US$46.2 million, or US$0.15 per diluted share, up 3% compared to\na profit of US$44.8 million, or US$0.15 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023 and up 161% compared to\na profit of US$17.7 million, or US$0.06 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. During the second quarter of\n2024, net income was mostly impacted by higher finance income, given the $23 million non-cash mark to market\neffect related to Argentine bonds investments used to hedge our local currency position in that market.\nAs of June 30, 2024, dLocal had US$531.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, including US$186.2 million of own\nfunds and US$345.4 million of merchants’ funds. The consolidated cash position decreased by US$17.8 million\nfrom US$549.4 million as of June 30, 2023. When compared to the US$572.4 million cash position as of March\n31, 2024, it decreased by US$40.7 million, mainly explained by the US$81.8 million of own funds used to buy back\nthe company’s own shares, in connection to the US$200 million Share Buyback Program announced in May 2024.\nThe following table summarizes our key performance metrics:\nThree months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\nKey Performance metrics (In millions of US$ except for %)\nTPV 6,035 4,373 38% 11,346 7,948 43%\nRevenue 171.3 161.1 6% 355.7 298.4 19%\nGross Profit 69.8 70.8 -1% 132.8 132.6 0%\nGross Profit margin 41% 44% -3p.p 37% 44% -7p.p\nAdjusted EBITDA 42.7 52.0 -18% 79.5 97.5 -19%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 25% 32% -7p.p 22% 33% -10p.p\nAdjusted EBITDA/Gross Profit 61% 74% -12p.p 60% 74% -14p.p\nProfit 46.2 44.8 3% 64.0 80.2 -20%\nProfit margin 27% 28% -1p.p -9p.p\n18% 27%\n8 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nSecond quarter 2024\nbusiness highlights\n2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, pay-ins TPV increased 34% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter to\nPO 1183.5 1189.2 1410.5 1653.0 1762.8\nUS$4.3 billion, accounting for 71% of the TPV.

The currency devaluation is also the main\ndriver of the sequential decrease.\nLatAm gross profit decreased by 13% year-over-year and increased by 10% quarter-over-quarter to US$53.5\nmillion, accounting for 77% of total gross profit. Most of the year-over-year decline is explained by Argentina,\ndue to lower FX spreads following the currency devaluation in December 2023. In the region, gross profit was\nalso impacted by Mexico, due to merchant repricing and local-to-local increase; and by Chile, given lower\ncross-border volumes. Other LatAm markets showed a 10% year-over-year increase in gross profit, driven by Tier\n0 merchants’ growth. Sequentially, the growth was mainly driven by the (i) growth in Argentina, and other LatAm\nmarkets, primarily Colombia and Costa Rica; and (ii) Brazil, with lower processing costs following renegotiation\nwith processors, coupled with change in payment mix. Those two factors partially offset the impact of a key\nmerchant repricing, with full impact in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2 months in previous one.\nAfrica and Asia gross profit increased by 79% year-over-year to US$16.3 million, accounting for the remaining\n23% of total gross profit. This annual comparison is explained by our overall growth in Egypt; ramp-up of our\nmerchants in South Africa, primarily in the commerce vertical; and temporary FX dynamics in Nigeria.\nSequentially, gross profit increased by 13%, attributable to temporary FX dynamics in Nigeria and growth in\nOther Africa and Asia.\nDuring the quarter, Revenue from Existing Merchants reached US$161.7 million compared to US$ 177.1 million\nin the first quarter of 2024. The quarter-over-quarter comparison was negatively affected by the currency\ndevaluation, as previously discussed, despite healthy volume growth. On the annual comparison, Revenue from\nExisting Merchants increased by 8% and the net revenue retention rate, or NRR, reached 100%, which was\nimpacted by Nigeria currency devaluation.\nRevenue from New Merchants accounted for US$9.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to US$\n11.2 million in the same quarter of the prior year.\n9 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24\nThe tables below present the breakdown of dLocal’s TPV by product and type of flow: PO 1071.7 1183.5 1189.2 1410.5 1653.0\nYoY 133% 114% 73% 47% 54%\nQoQ 11% 10% 0% 19% 17%\n% share 30% 27% 26% 28% 31%\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\nPI 2502.8 3189.8 3429.1 3700.8 3657.3\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share YoY 52% 70% 68% 59% 46%\nQoQ 7% 27% 8% 8% -1%\nPay-ins 4,273 71% 3,190 73% 7,930 70% 5,693 72%\n% share 70% 73% 74% 72% 69%\nPay-outs 1,763 29% 1,184 27% 3,416 30% 2,255 28% Total 3574.5 4373.4 4618.3 5111.2 5310.3\nCheck 7.73E-12 -1.27E-11 0 8.21E-05 0\nTotal TPV 6,035 100% 4,373 100% 11,346 100% 7,948 100%\n-20.73045863\nXB 1959.7 2219.3 2255.9 2235.1 2426.2\nYoY 51% 49% 46% 28% 24%\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June QoQ 12% 13% 2% -1% 9%\n% share 55% 51% 49% 44% 46%\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share\nL2L 1614.8 2154.1 2362.4 2876.1 2884.1\nCross-border 2,701 45% 2,219 51% 5,127 45% 4,179 53% YoY 101% 128% 99% 86% 79%\nQoQ 4% 33% 10% 22% 0%\nLocal to Local 3,334 55% 2,154 49% 6,219 55% 3,769 47%\n% share 45% 49% 51% 56% 54%\nTotal TPV 6,035 100% 4,373 100% 11,346 100% 7,948 100% Total 3574.5 4373.4 4618.3 5111.2 5310.3\n1.18E-11 -2.00E-11 2.00E-11 8.21E-05 0\nThe tables below present the breakdown of dLocal’s revenue by geography:\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share\nLatin America 138.7 81% 126.9 79% 264.1 74% 225.1 75%\nBrazil 42.3 25% 41.2 26% 85.3 24% 64.0 21%\nArgentina 20.5 12% 20.7 13% 34.3 10% 40.7 14%\nMexico 35.8 21% 28.3 18% 69.9 20% 51.0 17%\nChile 12.3 7% 14.2 9% 24.7 7% 28.4 10%\nOther LatAm 27.8 16% 22.5 14% 49.9 14% 41.0 14%\nAfrica & Asia 32.6 19% 34.3 21% 91.6 26% 73.3 25%\nNigeria 1.1 1% 20.4 13% 8.3 2% 47.3 16%\nEgypt 15.0 9% 4.7 3% 54.0 15% 8.1 3%\nOther Africa & Asia 16.5 10% 9.2 6% 29.2 8% 17.9 6%\nTotal Revenue 171.3 100% 161.1 100% 355.7 100% 298.4 100%\n10 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe tables below present the breakdown of dLocal’s gross profit by geography:\nIn millions of US$ except for % Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 % share 2023 % share 2024 % share 2023 % share\nLatin America 53.5 77% 61.7 87% 102.1 77% 114.5 86%\nBrazil 19.2 28% 19.6 28% 37.1 28% 30.6 23%\nArgentina 7.6 11% 13.8 19% 12.8 10% 31.6 24%\nMexico 8.8 13% 10.6 15% 18.7 14% 17.5 13%\nChile 8.3 12% 8.9 13% 15.7 12% 18.0 14%\nOther LatAm 9.6 14% 8.7 12% 17.7 13% 16.8 13%\nAfrica & Asia 16.3 23% 9.1 13% 30.7 23% 18.1 14%\nNigeria 2.0 3% 0.2 0% 2.5 2% 2.6 2%\nEgypt 9.8 14% 4.2 6% 20.1 15% 6.9 5%\nOther Africa & Asia 4.5 7% 4.7 7% 8.1 6% 8.5 6%\nTotal Gross Profit 69.8 100% 70.8 100% 132.8 100% 132.6 100%\n11 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOperating\nacross 40+\ncountries in\nemerging\nmarkets\nSanto Domingo, D.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities. Finally, dLocal\nis unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA over\ngross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal cannot reliably predict certain of their necessary\ncomponents, such as impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProfit for the period 46,239 44,791 63,957 80,241\nIncome tax expense 10,060 8,774 17,174 13,055\nDepreciation and amortization 4,089 2,869 7,851 5,384\nFinance income and costs, net1 (28,045) (7,459) (28,344) (8,850)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 6,776 1,421 11,237 3,750\nOther operating loss2 1,553 - 3,372 -\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets 76 (21) (101) 30\nInflation adjustment 1,941 1,661 4,309 2,680\nOther non-recurring costs - - - 1,229\nAdjusted EBITDA 42,689 52,036 79,455 97,519\nNote: 1In Q2 2024, the Finance income and costs, net line was impacted by the non-cash mark to market effect related to Argentine bonds\ninvestments in the amount of US$22.8 million. 2In Q2 2024, the company wrote-off certain amounts related to merchants/processors\noff-boarded by dLocal.\n13 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1In 2022, the Company utilized FTX Trading Ltd.

On November 11, 2022, when\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been\nprocessed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a\nthird-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and\na gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. In Q1 2024, the company has identified specific\ncollection entities from which it anticipates non-receipt of outstanding amounts.3 In Q4 2023, other non-recurring costs were related to class\naction expense, which included fees from independent global expert services. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report and class action expense, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included.\nUnaudited quarterly results.\nNote: 1Correspond to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel,\nindependent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\nNote: 1 XXXXX. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to\nclass action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting\nadvisory firm were included.\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one\ncontract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally\nwithout the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local\nentities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\nRounding\nWe have made rounding adjustments to some of the figures included in this interim report. Accordingly,\nnumerical figures shown as totals in some tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that\npreceded them.\n17 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking\nstatements convey dLocal’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, including\nguidance in respect of total payment volume, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit margin. Forward-looking statements regarding dLocal and amounts\nstated as guidance are based on current management expectations and involve known and\nunknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause dLocal’s actual results,\nperformance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances\nor achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Certain of these risks\nand uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and\n“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of dLocal’s filings\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, dLocal undertakes\nno obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect\ncircumstances or events after the date hereof. In addition, dLocal is unable to present a\nquantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal\ncannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment\ngains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\n18 2nd QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\ndLocal Limited\nCertain financial information\nConsolidated Condensed Interim Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three-month\nand six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\nThree months ended 30 of June Six months ended 30 of June\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContinuing operations\nRevenues 171,279 161,138 355,709 298,425\nCost of services (101,468) (90,378) (222,927) (165,828)\nGross profit 69,811 70,760 132,782 132,597\nTechnology and development expenses (6,408) (2,640) (11,873) (4,930)\nSales and marketing expenses (4,505) (3,106) (9,136) (7,963)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (27,074) (17,268) (51,406) (32,548)\nNet impairment losses on trade receivables (76) 21 101 (30)\nOther operating (loss)/gain (1,553) -

Additionally, we\nsaw one of our largest merchants achieve a new level in our tiered pricing scheme, and also re-negotiate fees, as\ntheir contract came up for renewal.\nGross profit was US$63.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 2% compared to US$61.8 million in the first\nquarter of 2023 and down 10% compared to US$69.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. QoQ gross profit was\nnegatively impacted by the abovementioned seasonality and renegotiation with a top merchant, in addition to\nbusiness mix with higher payout volumes.\nAs a result, gross profit margin was 34% in this quarter, compared to 45% in the first quarter of 2023 and 37% in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023.\nGross profit over TPV was at 1.2% decreasing from 1.7% in the first quarter of 2023 and from 1.4% in the fourth\nQuarter (YoY) 1Q23 4Q23 1Q24\nquarter of 2023, mainly due to shifts in business mix, with higher share of pay-outs, in addition to the QoQ Growth YoY Growth CAGR\nTPV $3.6 $5.1 $5.3 4% 49% 10%\nabovementioned new price tiering and renegotiation, and finally the continued growth of other Tier 0 merchants.\nGross Revenue $137.3 $188.0 $184.4 -2% 34% 8%\nOperating income was US$26.9 million, down 32% compared to US$39.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 and\nGross Profit $61.8 $69.7 $63.0 -10% 2% 0%\ndown 34% compared to US$41.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Sequentially, out of the 6 p.p. decline, half was driven by previously noted gross profit\ncompression and the remaining by incremental OPEX. Following the same trend, Adjusted EBITDA over gross\nprofit contracted to 58%, compared to 74% in the first quarter of 2023 and 71% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nNet financial income was US$0.3 million, compared to US$1.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 and US$1.0\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEffective income tax rate was 29%, compared to 11% in the first quarter of 2023 and 21% in the fourth quarter of\n2023, as a result of the mix in revenues shifting towards higher tax entities.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2024 was US$17.7 million, or US$0.06 per diluted share, down 50% compared\nto a profit of US$35.5 million, or US$0.11 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023 and down 38% compared\nto a profit of US$28.5 million, or US$0.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter\nof 2024, net income was mostly affected by lower EBITDA and higher tax rate.\n7 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nAs of March 31, 2024, dLocal had US$572.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, including US$211.9 million of\nown funds and US$360.5 million of merchants’ funds.

YoY revenue growth was\nnegatively impacted by Argentina, down 31% YoY. Lower revenues in Argentina were driven by several factors\nincluding more than 70% devaluation of the official rate; tighter FX spreads, combined with a higher proportion\nof local-to-local volume; in addition to lower TPV given that many of our merchants have pulled back from that\nmarket given the macro instability of the last 12 months. Nevertheless, we continue to see Argentina as a key\ngeography for our business and believe as the country stabilizes, it should come back to growth. Sequentially,\nLatAm revenue contracted by 5% mainly driven by seasonality, with Q4 being a very strong quarter for our\necommerce vertical, in addition to the new price tiering and renegotiation with one of our largest merchants.\nThese two factors largely explain the 14% and 4% quarter-over-quarter decreases in Brazil and Mexico\nrevenues, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by Argentina, that increased by 31%\nquarter-over-quarter, mainly driven by higher cross border settlements.\nAfrica and Asia revenue grew by 51% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to US$59.0 million,\naccounting for the remaining 32% of total revenue. Part of the growth was driven by Egypt with revenues\ngrowing by 11x year-over-year and 2x quarter-over-quarter. The growth in Egypt and other Africa and Asia more\nthan offset the -73% year-ver-year and -74% quarter-over-quarter decrease in Nigeria revenues mostly driven by:\n(i) the tightening of spreads between market and official rates after the Naira devaluation in February 2024, and\n(ii) higher proportion of L2L volumes and (iii) a sequential decline in TPV as our Financial Services vertical saw\na material drop in volume after the devaluation, with less fx trades occurring on our merchants’ platforms.\nLatAm gross profit decreased by 8% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter to US$48.6 million,\naccounting for 77% of total gross profit. This result was significantly impacted by Argentina, with gross profit\ndown 71% YoY, given the lower FX revenue, as in the past we benefited from the wide FX spreads, alongside\nlower cross border share. Excluding Argentina, gross profit in LatAm grew 24% YoY, driven primarily by the\nstrong performance in our most competitive markets with Brazil up 63% and Mexico up 44% YoY. Sequentially,\nthe contraction was mainly driven by Brazil due to the following drivers: (i) the previously mentioned key\nmerchant new price tiering and renegotiation, (ii) the ecommerce seasonality, and (iii) the increased pay-out\nmix.\nAfrica and Asia gross profit increased by 60% year-over-year to US$14.4 million, accounting for the remaining\n23% of total gross profit. This result was supported by a strong growth in Egypt with gross profit up 4x driven\nby our merchants' growth in that country. Similarly to Argentina, in Egypt we benefited from the wide spreads\nand our liquidity position having developed XB flows of pay-ins and pay-outs. The gross profit growth in Egypt\nwas partially offset by Nigeria, where gross profit was down 78% YoY as a consequence of a strong\ndevaluation of the Naira. Sequentially, gross profit decreased by 4%, also attributable to Nigeria.\n9 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24\nPO 1071.7 1183.5 1189.2 1410.5 1653.0\nDuring the quarter, dLocal continued delivering strong revenue growth both from existing and from new YoY 133% 114% 73% 47% 54%\ncustomers.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 31 of March\n2024 2023\nProfit for the period 17,718 35,450\nIncome tax expense 7,114 4,281\nDepreciation and amortization 3,762 2,515\nFinance income and costs, net (299) (1,391)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 4,461 2,329\nOther operating loss¹ 1,819 -\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets (177) 51\nInflation adjustment 2,368 1,019\nOther non-recurring costs² - 1,229\nAdjusted EBITDA 36,766 45,483\nNote: 1In Q1 2024, the company wrote-off certain amounts related to merchants off-boarded by dLocal. 2It includes non-recurring costs related\nto an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and forensic accounting advisory firm.\n13 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1In 2022, the Company utilized FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) services for the repatriation of funds from one country. On November 11, 2022, when\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been\nprocessed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a\nthird-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and\na gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. In Q1 2024, the company has identified specific\ncollection entities from which it anticipates non-receipt of outstanding amounts.3 In Q4 2023, other non-recurring costs were related to class\naction expense, which included fees from independent global expert services. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report and class action expense, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert\nservices and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included.\nUnaudited quarterly results.\nNote: 1Correspond to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel,\nindependent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\nNote: 1 XXXXX. 2Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to\nclass action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting\nadvisory firm were included.\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal Adjusted net income is defined as the profit for the\nperiod (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment\nnon-cash charges, secondary offering expenses, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation\n(see detailed methodology for Adjusted EBITDA in page 9). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to\nthe fair value gain from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan\ndenominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds. In addition, it excludes the inflation\nadjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for\nunderstanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and\ninflation. Our calculation for Adjusted Net Income may differ from similarly-titled measures presented by other companies\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for our measure of profit for the period as presented in\naccordance with IFRS.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 31 of March\n2024 2023\nNet income as reported 17,718 35,450\nInflation adjustment 2,368 1,019\nLoan - exchange difference 6,729 -\nFair value (loss) / gains of financial assets at FVTPL (bonds) (10,815) (89)\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets (177) 51\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 4,461 2,329\nOther operating (gain)/loss 1,819 -\nOther non-recurring costs - 1,229\nTax on adjustments (1,361) (31)\nAdjusted net income 20,742 39,958\n14 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nEarnings per share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted\naverage number of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-months period ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023.\nOur diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group of dLocal by\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average\nnumber of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential common shares into\ncommon shares.\nThe following table presents the information used as a basis for the calculation of our\nearnings per share:\nThree months ended 31 of March\n2024 2023\nProfit attributable to common shareholders (thousands USD) 17,708 35,444\nWeighted average number of common shares 296,093,840 295,125,862\nAdjustments for calculation of diluted earnings per share 14,028,247 16,441,184\nWeighted average number of common shares for calculating diluted earnings per share 310,122,087 311,567,046\nBasic earnings per share 0.06 0.12\nDiluted earnings per share 0.06 0.11\nThis press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in\nInternational Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by\nInternational Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one contract),\nglobal companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally without the\nneed to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local entities, and\nintegrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n16 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\n17 1st QUARTER 2024 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities. Finally, dLocal\nis unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA over\ngross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal cannot reliably predict certain of their necessary\ncomponents, such as impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nProfit for the period 40,364 32,338 120,605 89,333\nIncome tax expense 8,897 2,287 21,952 7,651\nDepreciation and amortization 3,237 2,110 8,621 5,690\nFinance income and costs, net (1,548) 2,479 (10,398) 3,519\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 3,322 1,599 7,072 4,874\nOther operating (gain)/loss - 706 - 706\nSecondary offering expenses¹ - - - 89\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets2 (2,508) (24) (2,478) (106)\nInflation adjustment 3,817 127 6,497 905\nOther non-recurring costs3 - - 1,229 -\nAdjusted EBITDA 55,581 41,622 153,100 112,661\nNote: 1Corresponds to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 During 2022, the Company utilized\nFTX Trading Ltd.

On November 11, 2022, when FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United\nStates, the Company had deposits of USD 5,576, whose withdrawals had not been processed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Group does not hold any positions in crypto assets.” During the three months ending September 2023, the Group\nreassessed the recovery probability of its deposits based on negotiations with third parties that are willing to acquire them and publicly available information.\nThus, the Group recognized a gain of USD 2,509 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance for the period ending September 30, 2023. 3 It includes\nnon-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel, independent global\nexpert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\n9 3rd QUARTER OF 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nSpecial note regarding Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal Adjusted net income is defined as the profit for the\nperiod (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment\nnon-cash charges, secondary offering expenses, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation\n(see detailed methodology for Adjusted EBITDA in page 9). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to\nthe fair value gain from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan\ndenominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds. In addition, it excludes the inflation\nadjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for\nunderstanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and\ninflation. Our calculation for Adjusted Net Income may differ from similarly-titled measures presented by other companies\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for our measure of profit for the period as presented in\naccordance with IFRS.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted net income:\n$ in thousands Three months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nProfit for the period, as reported 40,364 32,338 120,605 89,333\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 3,322 1,599 7,072 4,874\nOther operating (gain)/loss - 706 - 706\nSecondary offering expenses¹ - - - 89\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets2 (2,508) (24) (2,478) (106)\nInflation adjustment3 3,817 127 6,497 905\nOther non-recurring costs4 - - 1,229 -\nFair value (loss) / gains of financial assets at FVTPL5 (24,232) - (27,797) -\nExchange difference - intercompany loan in USD5 27,351 - 29,166 -\nIncome tax adjustments6 1,092 56 479 56\nAdjusted Net Income 49,206 34,802 134,773 95,857\nNote: 1 Corresponds to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2 During 2022, the Company utilized\nFTX Trading Ltd.

In this sense, the financial statements of the Argentinian subsidiaries were restated to reflect\nthe purchasing power of the currency and therefore a gain on net monetary position arose. 4 It includes non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the\nallegations made by a short-seller report, including fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and forensic accounting advisory firm.\n5During Q3 2023 we recognized a fair value gain of US$ 24.2 million (US$ 3.6 million in Q2 2023) from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and an exchange\ndifference loss of US$ 27.4 million (-US$ 1.8 million in Q2 2023) from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to\npurchase the bonds. 6We calculated the tax impact on all adjustments based on their corresponding tax rate.\n10 3rd QUARTER OF 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nEarnings per share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted\naverage number of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-months and nine-month periods\nended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nOur diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group of dLocal by\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average\nnumber of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential common shares into\ncommon shares.\nThe following table presents the information used as a basis for the calculation of our\nearnings per share:\nThree months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nProfit attributable to common shareholders (thousands USD) 40,308 32,462 120,449 89,326\nWeighted average number of common shares 289,411,641 295,918,751 292,058,528 295,455,429\nAdjustments for calculation of diluted earnings per share 16,620,498 17,246,606 16,509,161 17,783,776\nWeighted average number of common shares for calculating\n306,032,139 313,165,357 308,567,689 313,239,205\ndiluted earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share 0.14 0.11 0.41 0.30\nDiluted earnings per share 0.13 0.10 0.39 0.29\nThis press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in\nInternational Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by\nInternational Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one contract),\nglobal companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally without the\nneed to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local entities, and\nintegrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n12 3rd QUARTER OF 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\n13 3rd QUARTER OF 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking\nstatements convey dLocal’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, including\nguidance in respect of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit CAGR and Adjusted EBITDA\nover gross profit. Forward-looking statements regarding dLocal and amounts stated as\nguidance are based on current management expectations and involve known and unknown\nrisks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause dLocal’s actual results, performance or\nachievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or\nachievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Certain of these risks\nand uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and\n“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of dLocal’s filings\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, dLocal undertakes\nno obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect\ncircumstances or events after the date hereof. In addition, dLocal is unable to present a\nquantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal\ncannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment\ngains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment.\n14 3rd QUARTER OF 2023 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\ndLocal Limited\nCertain interim financial information\nConsolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three-month and\nnine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nThree months ended 30 of September Nine months ended 30 of September\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nContinuing operations\nRevenues 163,921 111,864 462,346 300,497\nCost of services (89,378) (57,992) (255,206) (153,432)\nGross profit 74,543 53,872 207,140 147,065\nTechnology and development expenses (3,696) (1,692) (8,626) (4,741)\nSales and marketing expenses (4,447) (3,472) (12,410) (9,444)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (17,378) (11,483) (49,926) (30,872)\nImpairment (loss)/gain on financial assets 2,508 24 2,478 106\nOther operating (loss)/gain -

For the full year, TPV reached US$10.6 billion, representing 75% year-over-year growth\ncompared to US$6.0 billion in 2021.\nRevenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 amounted to US$118.4 million, up 55% year-over-year compared to\nUS$76.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and up 6% compared to US$111.9 million in the third quarter of\n2022. The slower revenue growth relative to TPV was mainly driven by business mix. During the fourth quarter of\n2022, we had a combination of 1) higher local-to-local pay-outs, 2) some large global retail merchants, with lower\nthan average take rate growing faster, and 3) a decrease in revenue in Argentina, where we have higher than\naverage take rate. For the full year, revenues amounted to US$418.9 million, representing 72% year-over-year\ngrowth compared to US$244.1 million in 2021.\nGross profit was US$55.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 42% year-over-year compared to US$38.9\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and up 2% compared to US$53.9 million in the third quarter of 2022. For the\nfull year, gross profit amounted to US$202.2 million compared to US$130.4 million in 2021, representing 55%\nyear-over-year growth.\nGross profit margin was 47% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 48% in the third quarter of 2022 and 51%\nin the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was impacted by higher volumes from\nglobal merchants in certain geographies and a decrease in revenues in Argentina. For the full year, gross profit\nmargin was 48% compared to 53% in 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA was US$40.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 39% year-over-year compared to US$29.1\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and down 3% compared to US$41.6 million in the third quarter of 2022 as a\nresult of continued investments in expanding our team, marketing and travel expenses related to two main\nannual commercial events and higher legal fees. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA was US$153.1 million,\nrepresenting 54% year-over-year growth compared to US$99.2 million in 2021.\nAs a result, Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 37% in the third quarter\nof 2022 and 38% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37% compared to\n41% in 2021.\nDuring the quarter we recorded net financial losses of US$3.1 million, mainly driven by negative exchange rate\ndifferences. Net financial losses reached US$6.4 million in the full year 2022.\nProfit for the fourth quarter of 2022 was US$19.4 million, or US$0.06 per diluted share, down 18% compared to a\nprofit of US$23.5 million, or US$0.08 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2021 and down 40% compared to\na profit of US$32.3 million, or US$0.10 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2022. For the full year, profit was\nUS$108.7 million, or US$0.35 per diluted share, compared with profit of US$77.9 million, or US$0.25 per diluted\nshare, in 2021.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 included 1) deposits with FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) in the\namount of $5.6M, the withdrawals of which have not yet been processed by FTX and were recorded as a loss\nallowance, and 2) higher fees of US$2.0 million from independent counsel, independent global expert services\nand forensic accounting advisory related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report.\nExcluding these expenses that we believe are non-recurring in nature, profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 would\nhave amounted to US$27.0 million and to US$116.3 million in the full year 2022.\n7 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFourth quarter & full year 2022\nfinancial highlights\nAs of December 31, 2022, dLocal had US$468.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, including US$247.8 million\nof own funds and US$220.3 million of merchants’ funds. The consolidated cash position increased by US$131.9\nmillion from US$336.2 million as of December 31, 2021. When compared to the US$542.3 million cash position\nas of September 30, 2022, it decreased by US$74.2 million. The decrease of US$72.2 million in own funds was\nmainly driven by the short-term measures taken during the fourth quarter of 2022 to bring additional comfort to\nour merchants and partners in light of the short seller report. These measures required the use of US$52.9\nmillion of own funds, including providing short-term guarantees and advances to merchants, obtaining extended\nlines of credits in banks and payment methods requirements. We expect the situation to normalize over the next\nfew quarters. In addition, we cancelled a US$14.6 million loan with own funds and invested $2.0 million in our\nshare buy back program that commenced shortly before year end.\nThe following table summarizes our key performance metrics:\nThree Months Ended December 31 Twelve Months Ended December 31\n2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change\nKey Performance metrics (In millions of US$ except for %)\nTPV 3,296 1,856 78% 10,567 6,049 75%\nRevenue 118.4 76.3 55% 418.9 244.1 72%\nGross Profit 55.1 38.9 42% 202.2 130.4 55%\nGross Profit margin 47% 51% -5p.p 48% 53% -5p.p\nAdjusted EBITDA 40.4 29.1 39% 153.1 99.2 54%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 34% 38% -4p.p 37% 41% -4p.p\nProfit 19.4 23.5 -18% 108.7 77.9 40%\nProfit margin 16% 31% -15p.p 26% 32% -6p.p\n8 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\n900+\nlocal payment\nmethods\nFourth quarter & full year 2022\nbusiness highlights\nIn terms of products, during the quarter, pay-ins TPV increased by 65% year-over-year and 14%\nquarter-over-quarter to US$2.3 billion, accounting for 71% of the TPV. For the full year, pay-ins TPV increased by\n91% year-over-year to US$7.9 billion, accounting for 75% of the TPV.\nPay-outs TPV increased by 119% year-over-year and 40% quarter-over-quarter to US$1.0 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2022, accounting for the remaining 29% of the TPV. For the full year, pay-outs TPV increased by 39%\nyear-over-year to US$2.7 billion, accounting for the remaining 25% of the TPV.\nCross-border volume accounted for 53% of the TPV in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 56% in the third\nquarter of 2022 and with 63% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, cross-border volume accounted\nfor 58% of the TPV, compared to 65% in 2021. Local-to-local volumes continue to grow at very healthy rates\nand gain relevance as we continue to penetrate this solution with our merchants.\ndLocal is also well diversified across geographies. In 2022, the Company continued to focus on its expansion\nefforts and added Honduras to its geographic network during the fourth quarter, after adding Ivory Coast,\nNicaragua, Rwanda and Saudi Arabia during the first nine months of 2022, bringing the total number of\ncountries in which dLocal makes its services available to 40, of which 23 countries are outside Latin America.\nRevenue increased across all regions during the quarter. LatAm grew 30% compared to the fourth quarter of\n2021 to US$92.9 million and 6% quarter-over-quarter, accounting for 78% of total revenue. For the full year,\nLatAm increased by 54% compared to 2021 to US$345.4 million, accounting for 82% of the total revenue.\nAfrica and Asia revenue increased by 423% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter to US$25.6 million,\naccounting for the remaining 22% (compared to 6% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021). For the full\nyear, Africa and Asia revenue increased by 259% compared to 2021 to US$73.6 million, accounting for 18% of\nthe total revenue, which we believe demonstrates the solid execution capability of dLocal and its ability to\nexpand into new geographies.\nDuring the quarter, dLocal continued delivering strong revenue growth both from existing and from new\ncustomers. Revenue from Existing Merchants increased from US$68.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 to\nUS$111.4 million. The net revenue retention rate, or NRR, in the fourth quarter of 2022 reached 146%. During\nthe full year 2022, revenue from Existing Merchants increased from US$228.1 million in 2021 to US$401.8\nmillion and the NRR reached 165%, exceeding our internal targets.\nRevenue from New Merchants was US$7.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.

Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented\nunder IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by\nanalysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates\noperating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including\ncompetitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin to net income:\n$ in thousands Three-month period ended December 31 Twelve-month period ended December 31\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nProfit for the period1 19,364 23,549 108,697 77,853\nIncome tax expense 3,935 2,114 11,586 7,647\nDepreciation and amortization 2,457 1,507 8,147 4,747\nFinance income and costs, net 3,071 (1,234) 6,590 (1,996)\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 3,810 2,236 8,684 7,590\nOther operating (gain)/loss (9) - 697 (2,896)\nSecondary offering expenses2 - 716 89 5,158\nTransaction costs3 - 22 - 687\nImpairment loss / (gain) on financial assets4 5,640 25 5,534 33\nInflation adjustment 132 137 1,037 334\nOther non-recurring costs5 2,014 - 2,014 -\nAdjusted EBITDA 40,414 29,072 153,075 99,157\nNote: 1In 2022, includes a net gain of USD 14,559 related to the effective portion of the change in the spot rate of the hedged currency, which offsets a foreign exchange loss of USD 14,832 (together for a net foreign exchange\nloss of USD 273 included in Cost of Services).

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform,\nand one contract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds\nglobally without the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up\nnumerous local entities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each\nmarket.\n16 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are\navailable for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments\nindustry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways,\nprocessors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process.\n“Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a\ndifferent currency and/or in a different geography.\n“Enterprise Global Merchants” means merchants with at least US$6 million of annual TPV processed through\nour platform.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of\nthe merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments,\nbank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency.\n“Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s\nmerchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior\nPeriod/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior\nperiod. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same\ncustomers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from\nany upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant\ncustomers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes\nrevenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come\nfrom existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing\ncustomer base.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their\ncustomers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business\npartners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill\nrevenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant\ncustomers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all\npayments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly\non the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an\nindicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and\ngrowth of dLocal’s business.\n17 4th QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.

We saw robust growth in TPV and revenue, increasing by\n67% and 72% year-over-year, respectively, despite the high comparison base from last year, and both\nmetrics accelerating by 16% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to deliver profitable growth and our\nstrong performance over the past quarters has allowed us to build a strong cash position. Adjusted\nEBITDA was up by 47% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter to US$38 million, and for the\nfourth consecutive quarter we maintained our Adjusted EBITDA margin stable at 38% while increasing\nour headcount 48% year-over-year to 632 employees.\nWe remain focused on building the best financial infrastructure for our merchants across multiple\nemerging markets. Our expansion efforts outside Latin America continue to yield results, as revenues\nin Africa and Asia increased triple digit by 155% year-over-year, representing 13% of our total revenues\nin this quarter. We continue to cross sell to merchants that originally started their relationship with us\nin Latin America, having now 9 out of our Top 10 merchants (in terms of TPV) processing payments\nwith us in Africa and Asia, with significant opportunities to continue scaling. In addition, we continue to\nsee merchants initiating their relationship with us through markets in Asia and Africa and then\nexpanding to Latin America.\nOur business has shown resilience and sustained growth, supported by the diversity of our merchants\nacross industry verticals, geographies, and products. This, combined with our strong cash generation,\ngive us confidence that we are uniquely positioned to fulfill our long-term growth strategy while\nnavigating a challenging and uncertain global macro environment. We will continue to execute with\ndiscipline into the big opportunities ahead of us,” said Sebastian Kanovich.\n2ND QUARTER 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS 3\n\n2nd quarter 2022\nfinancial highlights\nTotal Payment Volume (“TPV”) reached US$2.4 billion in the quarter, representing 67%\nyear-over-year growth compared to US$1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and 16% growth\ncompared to $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022.\nRevenues in the second quarter of 2022 amounted to US$101.2 million, representing 72%\nyear-over-year growth compared to US$59.0 million in the second quarter of 2021 and 16%\ngrowth compared to $87.5 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nGross profit was US$49.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, representing 47% year-over-year\ngrowth compared to US$33.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 and 14% growth compared to\nUS$43.6 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA was US$38.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, representing 47%\nyear-over-year growth compared to US$25.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 and 16%\ngrowth compared to US$32.9 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin was 38% in the second quarter of 2022, in line with the 38% recorded in\nthe first quarter of 2022 and compared to 44% in the second quarter of 2021.\nProfit for the second quarter of 2022 was US$30.7 million, or US$0.10 per diluted share,\nincreasing 73% compared to a profit of US$17.7 million, or US$0.06 per diluted share, for the\nsecond quarter of 2021 and increasing 17% compared to a profit of US$26.3 million, or US$0.08\nper diluted share, for the first quarter of 2022.\n2ND QUARTER 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS 5\n2nd quarter 2022\nfinancial highlights\nAs of June 30, 2022, dLocal had US$454.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities, compared to US$410.1 million as of March 31, 2022 and US$266.0 million as of June\n30, 2021. The quarter-over-quarter increase of US$43.9 million reflects an increase of US$18.4\nmillion in our funds and an increase of US$25.5 million in funds due to our merchants with\nrespect to the first quarter of 2022.\nThe following tables summarises our key performance metrics:\nThree months ended Six months ended\n30 June 2022 30 June 2021 30 June 2022 30 June 2021\nKey Performance metrics (In millions of $US except for %) (In millions of $US except for %)\nTPV 2,433 1,456 4,537 2,382\nTPV Growth YoY 67% 319% 91% 224%\nRevenue 101.2 59.0 188.6 99.2\nRevenue Growth YoY 72% 186% 90% 157%\nAdj.

During the second quarter of 2022, dLocal saw strong year-over-year\nand quarter-over-quarter growth in TPV driven by the performance and continued growth of its\nmerchants across most verticals, particularly in on-demand commerce, on-demand delivery,\ntravel, SaaS (“software as a service”) and advertising.\ndLocal is also well diversified across geographies, having a presence in 37 countries, out of which\n22 are outside Latin America. During the second quarter of 2022, dLocal continued to focus on its\nexpansion efforts, strengthening its presence in the countries in which it operates.\nRevenue increased across all regions during the quarter, with LatAm growing 63% compared to\nthe second quarter of 2021, accounting for 87% of total revenue. Asia & Africa revenue, which\naccounted for the remaining 13% (compared to 9% in the second quarter of 2021), increased by\n155% year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, dLocal continued delivering robust revenue growth both from existing and\nfrom new customers. Revenue from Existing Merchants increased by US$33.5 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2022 to US$92.5 million. The net revenue retention rate, or NRR, in the second\nquarter of 2022 reached 157%. Revenue from New Merchants was US$8.7 million for the second\nquarter of 2022.\ndLocal continued to enhance its product portfolio with improvements in our features for pay-ins\nand pay-outs while continuing to run pilot programs for new solutions such as dLocal Go and\nissuing-as-a-service.\n2ND QUARTER 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS 7\nSpecial Note Regarding Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\ndLocal has only one operating segment. dLocal measures its operating segment’s performance by Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and uses these metrics to make decisions about allocating resources.\nAdjusted EBITDA as used by dLocal is defined as the profit from operations before financing and taxation for the year or period, as\napplicable, before depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of right-of-use assets and intangible assets, and\nfurther excluding the changes in fair value of financial assets and derivative instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss,\nimpairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment non-cash charges, secondary offering\nexpenses, and inflation adjustment. dLocal defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the Adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated\nrevenues.\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may be commonly viewed as non-IFRS measures in other contexts,\npursuant to IFRS 8, (“Operating Segments”), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are treated by dLocal as IFRS\nmeasures based on the manner in which dLocal utilizes these measures. Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented under IFRS.\ndLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by analysts and\ninvestors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates operating\nsegment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including competitors, and\ntherefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin to net income:\nIn thousands of U.S dollars Three months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nProfit for the period 30,722 17,708 56,995 34,635\nIncome tax expense 4,151 1,596 5,364 2,975\nDepreciation and amortization 1,857 1,344 3,580 1,859\nSecondary offering expenses - 3,042 89 3,747\nTransaction costs - 341 - 454\nShare-based payment non-cash charges 1,241 2,116 3,275 2,681\nOther operating loss/(gain) 688 - 688 (2,896)\nOther charges, net (476) (222) 1,048 311\nAdjusted EBITDA 38,183 25,925 71,039 43,766\nRevenues 101,180 58,961 188,633 99,217\nAdjusted EBITDA 38,183 25,925 71,039 43,766\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 37.7% 44.0% 37.7% 44.1%\n2ND QUARTER 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS 8\nEARNINGS PER SHARE:\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the\nweighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-months\nand six-months periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nOur diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of\ndLocal by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus\nthe weighted average number of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all\ndilutive potential common shares into common shares.\nThe following table presents the information used as a basis for the calculation of our earnings\nper share:\nFor the three month period ended June 30 For the six month period ended June 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nProfit attributable to common shareholders (U.S.\n30,572,332 17,708,117 56,864,047 34,628,192\nDollars)\nWeighted average number of common shares 295,393,168 288,524,686 295,219,928 279,830,237\nAdjustments for calculation of diluted earnings per\n17,599,775 20,061,500 17,619,241 23,432,500\nshare\nWeighted average number of common shares for\n312,992,943 308,586,186 312,839,169 303,262,737\ncalculating diluted earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share 0.10 0.06 0.19 0.12\nDiluted earnings per share 0.10 0.06 0.18 0.11\nThis press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in\nInternational Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by\nInternational Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.

Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one\ncontract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally\nwithout the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local\nentities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market.\n2ND QUARTER 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS 10\nDefinition of selected operational metrics\n“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming\ntechniques that are available for software developers when they integrate with a particular service\nor application. In the payments industry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in\nthe money flow (such as payment gateways, processors, and service providers) to facilitate the\nmoney transfer process.\n“Enterprise Global Merchants” means merchants with at least US$6 million of annual TPV\nprocessed through our platform.\n“Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where\nthe end user of the merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and\ndebit cards, cash payments, bank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets.\n“NRR” means net revenue retention rate, which is the U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and\ngrowth of our merchants. We calculate the NRR of a period by dividing the current period\nrevenue by the prior period revenue. The prior period revenue is the revenue billed by us to all of\nour merchant customers in the corresponding period for the prior fiscal year. The current period\nrevenue is the revenue billed by us in the corresponding period for the current fiscal year to the\nsame merchant customers included in the calculation of the prior period revenue. Current period\nrevenue includes any upsells and cross sells of products, geographies, and payment methods to\nsuch merchant customers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, but excludes revenue from\nnew customers on-boarded during the last 12 months.\n“Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment\nfrom their customers.\n“Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to\nthe business partners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers.\n“Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we\ndid not bill revenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n“Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to\nthe merchant customers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year.\n2ND QUARTER 2022 | FINANCIAL RESULTS 11\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.
