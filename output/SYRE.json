All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding Spyre's expectations regarding the consummation of the offering and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions with respect to the offering. The words \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"predict,\" \"target,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" the negatives of these terms, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the anticipated timing of the offering, market conditions and satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the offering, the expected or potential impact of macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, general economic slowdown or a recession, changes in monetary policy, volatile market conditions, financial institution instability, as well as geopolitical instability, including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, conflict in Israel and surrounding areas, and geopolitical tensions in China on the Company's operations, the potential impacts of the BIOSECURE Act bill if passed into law and those risks described in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as in other filings and reports that the Company makes from time to time with the SEC. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for the Company's management to predict all risks, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements it may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding Spyre's expectations regarding the proposed offering, including the timing, size, structure and completion of the proposed offering on the anticipated terms or at all and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the offering. The words \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"predict,\" \"target,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" the negatives of these terms, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the Company's anticipated completion of the offering, market conditions and satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the offering, the expected or potential impact of macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, general economic slowdown or a recession, changes in monetary policy, volatile market conditions, financial institution instability, as well as geopolitical instability, including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, conflict in Israel and surrounding areas, and geopolitical tensions in China on the Company's operations, the potential impacts of the BIOSECURE Act bill if passed into law and those risks described in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as in other filings and reports that the Company makes from time to time with the SEC. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for the Company's management to predict all risks, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements it may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
