(NASDAQ:GIPR) (\"GIPR\" or the \"Company\") today announced its three and nine month financial and operating results for the period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Quarterly Highlights**\n\n(For the 3 months ended September 30, 2024)\n\n  * Generated net loss attributable to GIP common shareholders of $2.1 million, or ($0.55) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core FFO of ($146 thousand), or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core AFFO of $100 thousand, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share.\n\n\n\n\nFFO and related measures are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to Core FFO and Core AFFO is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\n  * Approximately 60% of our portfolio's annualized base rent (\"ABR\") as of September 30, 2024 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of \"BBB-\" or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, EXP Services, Kohl's Corporation, PRA Holdings, and The City of San Antonio which collectively contributed approximately 69% of our portfolio's annualized base rent.\n\n  * Our portfolio is 89% leased and occupied and tenants are 100% rent paying.\n\n  * Approximately 92% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on ABR as of September 30, 2024) provide for increases in contractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n\n  * Average effective annual rental per square foot is $14.75.\n\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n  * $1.58 million in total cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024.\n\n  * Total mortgage loans, net was $59.7 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue from operations were $2.4 million and $7.09 million respectively, as compared to $1.8 million and $4.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The overall revenue increase was driven by the integration of the 13-property portfolio acquired from Modiv in August 2023.\n\n  * Operating expenses, including G&A, for the same periods in the current year were $3.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively, due to increases in depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent acquisitions.\n\n  * Net operating income (\"NOI\") for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.7 million and $1.4 million for the same period last year, which is a direct result of the acquisition of properties.\n\n  * Net loss attributable to GIPR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $8.3 million as compared to $4 million for the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n**Commenting on the quarter, a letter from CEO David Sobelman:**\n\nTo the Shareholders and my colleagues at Generation Income Properties, Inc.,\n\nThe third quarter of this year presented challenges for our stock price, which reached an all-time low despite the significant transitional events we've achieved to position the company for long-term growth and sustainability. I recognize that some shareholders have expressed concerns, indicating that the company's recent dividend suspension holds more weight for them than our long-term outlook. It's clear that many of our shareholders view their investment primarily for the monthly dividend and the regular income it provides, rather than the intrinsic value of our growing assets. I understand this perspective, especially given that \"income\" is part of our company name. REITs are fundamentally structured to provide dividends, a practice established since their inception in the 1950s and 1960s, offering a transparent way for investors to engage in real estate markets that might otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nI recently finished reading \"Watch That Rat Hole: And Witness the REIT Revolution\" by Kenneth D. Campbell, one of the early analysts in the REIT industry. The book discusses how REITs were created to fund single-family home developers, providing the necessary short-term debt for their projects in the post-WWII era. This initiative arose from a pressing need in the United States, as developers struggled to secure funding from traditional banks for their short-term projects. Over time, the REIT structure evolved to include funding not only for debt but also for a variety of property types.\n\nThis historical context highlights that, since the industry's inception, many investments have focused on short-term returns. Campbell's book also notes that economic changes can impact these short-term strategies. When conditions shift - such as interest rate increases or changes in consumer behavior - companies may face significant adjustments, sometimes leading to drastic decisions like asset sales or restructuring.\n\nAt GIPR, we have always maintained a long-term, generational outlook to avoid succumbing to short-term market pressures. We believe that our approach has proven effective over the years in the industry generally, and we remain committed to making decisions that prioritize sustainable growth for the future.\n\nI recognize that long-term thinking can be challenging for many investors, and I share a sense of impatience regarding various aspects of my life, including the growth of GIPR. However, it's important to reflect on our progress. Approximately this time last year, we were half our current size, and we've made substantial strides since then. I also understand that many of our shareholders may not thoroughly review our public filings, so I'd like to highlight some key events from the previous quarter:\n\n  * **July 2, 2024** - We successfully raised $2.5 million in new capital through preferred units from a new investor.\n\n  * **July 3, 2024** - We made the difficult but strategic decision to suspend our dividend in order to focus on growth, with plans to prioritize reinstating the dividend when feasible.\n\n  * **July 19, 2024** - Due to our ongoing growth and increased complexities, we engaged Cohn Reznick, a top 20 accounting firm, as our independent auditor.\n\n  * **July 24, 2024** - We extended the redemption date for one of our unit holders from February 8, 2025, to February 8, 2027.\n\n  * **August 23, 2024** - We acquired an investment-grade tenanted building (Best Buy, NYSE: BBY, S&P: BBB) at an effective cap rate of 8.1%, set to begin in January 2025.\n\n  * **August 29, 2024** - We extended the maturity date of a loan set to expire in October 2024 to August 30, 2029, with no cash outlay required from the company.\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, we accomplished all this while maintaining the integrity of our current portfolio, with 100% rent collection from our tenants.\n\nI don't intend to paint this as solely good news. You have the responsibility to assess your investment wisely, and we aim to provide you with transparent information to aid in that decision. This level of transparency is a distinct advantage over private companies, where reporting would be considerably less frequent or detailed. Your access to our updates allows you to make informed decisions based on clarity regarding our activities.\n\n**Why Temporarily Suspend the Dividend**\n\nLet me start with this; our company is stable, our balance sheet is strong, and our tenants are paying rent as planned. However, our priority is growth, and we constantly require new assets and new capital to achieve that. Without growth, our stock price may experience temporary pressure before it increases in value. Currently, raising public capital would be costly and could dilute existing shareholders, providing better deals to new investors than to current ones. By conserving our cash for new asset acquisitions and debt reduction, we aim to enhance the company's long-term value.\n\nAdditionally, while I take the daily news with a grain of salt, it's evident that the economy remains uncertain. Recent reports indicate that bankruptcies in 2024 are expected to surpass those in 2023. Therefore, we are adopting a conservative approach to cash management, ensuring we can sustain this unpredictable period while positioning the company for future growth without making decisions based solely on fleeting market sentiments.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the information you receive from us may not always convey the broader context. Sometimes, we report on specific events without detailing their potential impact on other initiatives. Due to stringent regulations, we strive to provide you with all the information necessary to evaluate your investment in our company and to answer any questions about our decisions.\n\nOur choices are made with the long-term benefit of all shareholders in mind as we navigate this complex real estate market early in our public journey.\n\nIn the past, I've noted that analysts typically do not value companies based solely on dividends. Instead, they understand that dividends attract investor interest, which can drive stock prices.\n\nDividend = positive\n\nNo dividend = requires more analysis\n\nWhile the formulaic approach is standard in securities analysis, ultimately, market sentiment dictates stock prices. Therefore, I cannot predict exactly when our stock price will recover, but it often happens when investors recognize the undervaluation and begin purchasing shares.\n\nRegarding the reinstatement of the dividend, this is another item where I can't give you the exact date that will occur. However, I can assure you that when we made the decision to suspend the dividend, we were already strategizing on how to reverse that decision for the benefit of all shareholders. This process has involved thorough discussions on why the suspension was necessary, what actions we would take during this period, and how we could eventually reinstate the dividend.\n\n**How Do We Grow GIPR**\n\nWhile it may seem there's bad news this quarter due to our stock price decline, it's essential to acknowledge our journey. As one of GIPR's top five shareholders, I, too, prefer to see positive returns on investment. Warren Buffett famously stated in a 2008 op-ed, \"Bad news is an investor's best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price.\" Over the past three years, shareholders have seen our portfolio grow from eight properties to twenty-seven. We've successfully utilized our shares and operating partnership equity as currency for acquisitions and secured financing when many lenders were hesitant. We started with zero properties, went through our IPO with eight properties and have successfully grown the portfolio to 27 properties with only one public capital raise.\n\nWe plan to leverage our resources to acquire properties with partners, as we have done in the past, and we will continue to accept assets through our UPREIT program, requiring minimal cash outlay. Our focus on these growth strategies not only benefits the company but also aligns us with investors who understand our long-term vision.\n\n**Subsequent Events and Values**\n\nGIPR has no debt obligations due until 2028 and no cash redemptions due until 2026. These changes have been carefully planned and executed in recent months. Our Director of Capital Markets, Emily Hewland, has proactively managed our timelines, ensuring we face no imminent deadlines that limit our options. We adhere to Charlie Munger's principle of \"Inversion Thinking\", identifying potential pitfalls and proactively preventing them.\n\nGIPR's culture and core values are fundamental to our identity, akin to long-standing companies like Apple and Patagonia. Based in Tampa, FL, we have recently faced significant challenges, including hurricanes that impacted our community.\n\nWhile our team remained safe, many friends and family experienced devastating losses. Witnessing their struggles has been emotionally difficult. During this time, our Asset Manager, Bobby Rohrlack, led efforts to reach out to tenants who could help those affected in North Carolina and Florida. Leveraging our relationships with major corporations, we coordinated support for those in need.\n\nThe outcomes of Bobby's initiatives include:\n\n  * Walgreens: We connected their VP of Public Affairs with the ASYMCA to coordinate donations of household items.\n\n  * ASYMCA: We established communication with ASYMCA's Executive Director in Fayetteville, NC, to address urgent supply needs.\n\n  * Dollar General: Engaged with their VP of Real Estate to forward our outreach to their Community Giving Department.\n\n  * Dollar Tree - Connected with their Corporate Marketing Director, who is coordinating internal relief efforts and financial grants for impacted areas.\n\n  * PRA Group: Engaged their Facilities & Real Estate VP, who expressed interest in partnering with us.\n\n  * Starbucks: Met with local management to explore potential community collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn delivering this message, my aim is to be honest and transparent while outlining our plans moving forward. I understand that the topics of stock price and dividends weigh heavily on your minds, as they do on mine.\n\nWe still have a considerable journey ahead before we can claim the stature of some of our larger peers. However, as we navigate the capital and real estate markets, we are committed to seizing growth opportunities. I believe that the current market could present a favorable buying opportunity for both our shares and the assets we pursue.\n\nAs we continue this journey, rest assured that our portfolio remains stable, our tenants are fulfilling their obligations, and our balance sheet is solid.\n\nSincerely,\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/e94c80b5-b324-4d26-808f-3ee48981967a/942275/image.png)\n\nDavid Sobelman\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office, and industrial net lease properties in densely populated submarkets.

Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" and \"project\" and other similar words and expressions are intended to signify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Please refer to the risks detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024, as well as other filings on Form 10-Q and periodic filings on Form 8-K, for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law._\n\n**Notice Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our reported results and net earnings per diluted share, which are financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains and may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Core Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\"), Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"Core AFFO\"), and Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"). We believe the use of Core FFO, Core AFFO and NOIare useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and related measures, including NOI, should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. You should not consider our Core FFO, Core AFFO, or NOI as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below.\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**\n\n**As of September 30,** |  **As of December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**_Assets_**  \n**Investment in real estate**  \nLand |  $ |  23,268,037 |  $ |  21,996,902  \nBuilding and site improvements |  67,618,615 |  71,621,499  \nAcquired tenant improvements |  2,380,920 |  2,072,205  \nAcquired lease intangible assets |  10,501,756 |  10,571,331  \nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization |  (11,070,036 |  ) |  (8,855,332 |  )  \nNet real estate investments |  92,699,292 |  97,406,605  \nCash and cash equivalents |  1,547,110 |  3,117,446  \nRestricted cash |  34,500 |  34,500  \nDeferred rent asset |  435,767 |  1,106,191  \nPrepaid expenses |  270,626 |  139,941  \nAccounts receivable |  164,549 |  241,166  \nEscrow deposits and other assets |  982,637 |  493,393  \nHeld for sale assets |  5,750,250 |  -  \nRight of use asset, net |  6,088,025 |  6,152,174  \n**Total Assets** |  **$** |  **107,972,756** |  **$** |  **108,691,416**  \n**_Liabilities and Equity_**  \n**Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  79,297 |  $ |  406,772  \nAccrued expenses |  1,383,743 |  688,146  \nAccrued expense - related party |  683,347 |  683,347  \nAcquired lease intangible liabilities, net |  1,026,681 |  1,016,260  \nInsurance payable |  150,450 |  34,966  \nDeferred rent liability |  155,968 |  260,942  \nLease liability, net |  6,452,484 |  6,415,041  \nOther payable - related party |  452,460 |  1,809,840  \nLoan payable - related party |  5,500,000 |  5,500,000  \nMortgage loans, net of unamortized debt discount of $1,156,620 and $1,326,362 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and debt issuance costs |  58,551,152 |  56,817,310  \nDerivative liabilities |  809,339 |  537,424  \nTotal liabilities |  75,244,921 |  74,170,048  \n**Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests** |  26,135,796 |  18,812,423  \n**Preferred Stock - Series A Redeemable Preferred stock, net,**  \n$0.01 par value, 2,400,000 shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2,400,000 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023 with liquidation preferences of $5 per share |  - |  11,637,616  \n**Stockholders' Equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized; 5,419,855 and 2,620,707 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively |  54,232 |  26,207  \nAdditional paid-in capital |  29,129,543 |  18,472,049  \nAccumulated deficit |  (22,984,596 |  ) |  (14,833,058 |  )  \nTotal Generation Income Properties, Inc.

Basic & Diluted** |  **5,433,833** |  **2,618,077** |  **5,083,640** |  **2,591,956**  \n  \nThe table above presents FFO in accordance with the most current available NAREIT guidance and in alignment with current industry standards. Presentations of FFO in our prior filings and announcements did not include Loss on held for sale asset valuation as an add-back in calculating FFO, but the data for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 set forth above has been revised to include Loss on held for sale asset valuation as an add-back.\n\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets, and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\n\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\n\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\n**_Investor Contacts_**\n\nInvestor Relationsir@gipreit.com\n\n**SOURCE:** Generation Income Properties\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/942275/generation-income-properties-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-and-operating-results) on accesswire.com \n\nReleased November 15, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.gipreit.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### We keep a **generational** outlook in mind.

(NASDAQ:GIPR) (\"GIP\" or the \"Company\") announced the strategic acquisition of a 30,465 square foot retail building located in Ames, Iowa. The purchase price for the asset was $5.5 million, excluding transaction costs. The building is currently occupied by Best Buy, a reputable tenant with an investment-grade credit rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's. The existing lease agreement has approximately 6 years remaining, providing stable long-term income. The tenant has the option to extend the lease for two consecutive periods of 5 years each, ensuring potential for continued revenue generation. The annualized base rent from the lease stands at approximately $405,470, contributing to GIPR's rental income stream.\n\nGIPR financed the acquisition using a combination of approximately 55% cash and 45% debt, demonstrating a balanced approach to capital allocation. This strategic acquisition aligns with GIPR's objective to expand its portfolio with high-quality, income-generating assets. The addition of another investment-grade asset underscores GIPR's disciplined approach to identifying, underwriting, and executing acquisitions for the benefit of its shareholders.\n\nDavid Sobelman, President and Chief Executive Officer of GIPR, commented on the significance of the acquisition: \"In today's challenging market environment, we are pleased to have successfully acquired another investment-grade asset. This transaction exemplifies GIPR's commitment to disciplined investment strategies and our unwavering focus on shareholder value creation.\"\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office and industrial net lease properties located primarily in densely populated submarkets throughout the United States.

(NASDAQ:GIPR) (\"GIPR\" or the \"Company\") today announced its three and six month financial and operating results for the period ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Quarterly Highlights**\n\n(For the 3 months ended June 30, 2024)\n\n  * Generated net loss attributable to GIP common shareholders of $2.3 million, or ($0.42) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core FFO of ($41 thousand), or ($0.01) per basic and diluted share.\n\n  * Generated Core AFFO of $162 thousand, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share.\n\n\n\n\nFFO and related measures are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to Core FFO and Core AFFO is included at the end of this release.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\n  * Approximately 60% of our portfolio's annualized base rent (\"ABR\") as of June 30, 2024 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of \"BBB-\" or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, EXP Services, and Kohl's Corporation, PRA Holdings, and City of San Antonio and contributed approximately 69% of our portfolio's annualized base rent.\n\n  * Our portfolio is 89% leased and occupied and tenants are 100% rent paying.\n\n  * Approximately 92% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on ABR as of June 30, 2024) provide for increases in contractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n\n  * Average effective annual rental per square foot is $14.75.\n\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n  * $2.59 million in total cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024.\n\n  * Total mortgage loans, net was $56.3 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, total revenue from operations were $2.3 million and $4.7 million respectively, as compared to $1.3 million and $2.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The overall revenue increase was driven by the integration of the 13 property portfolio acquired from Modiv in August 2023.\n\n  * Operating expenses, including G&A, for the same periods were $3.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively, due to increases in depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent acquisitions.\n\n  * Net operating income (\"NOI\") for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.6 million and $1 million for the same period last year, which is a direct result of the acquisition of properties.\n\n  * Net loss attributable to GIPR for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.5 million as compared to $752 thousand for the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n**Commenting on the quarter, a letter from CEO David Sobelman:**\n\nTo the Shareholders of Generation Income Properties, Inc.:\n\nIt has only been 5 weeks since we last communicated with you, but as we release another earnings report and close out the second quarter of the year, we want to ensure we are keeping you apprised on the important events happening within your company. We think generationally, not day to day, week to week, quarter by quarter or even year to year. That has always been the premise of our company and continues to be today, as our culture and primary investment objectives are expected to remain static throughout any market cycle or influence.\n\nAchievements\n\nSince our last communication, we've:\n\n  1. Signed a lease with Auburn University (S&P: AA) at an industrial building in Huntsville, AL.\n\n  2. Received $2.5 million in cash contributed to our Limited Partnership from a new investor.\n\n  3. Entered into an agreement with a holder of common units of our operating partnership whereby we exchanged their common units for Series B-1 preferred units of our operating partnership having a redemption value of $7.15/unit and extended the redemption date on the units to July 2026 from January 2025.\n\n  4. Extended the redemption date for membership interests of our equity partner in two of our Norfolk, Virginia properties to February 2027 from February 2025.\n\n  5. Management has received indicative terms that are favorable to the Company, for both maturing Bayport loans for our Norfolk, Virginia properties, and expects to close by the end of August 2024.\n\n  6. Announced the hiring of CohnReznick as our company's independent registered accounting firm, a replacement for Malone Bailey who served us well up until this point of our growth.\n\n\n\n\nWith these recent accomplishments, we can now claim the following:\n\n  * We currently have 100% rent collection from our leased properties.\n\n  * Our company's net operating income (NOI) is derived from approximately 68% investment grade tenants.\n\n  * Occupancy has increased to 93%. \n\n\n\n\nDespite any of the economic headwinds that we've been receiving, we need to emphatically tell you that we believe our portfolio is strong, performing as planned, rent is being collected and our company is stable. You can see that we continue to accomplish a lot as it relates to our current portfolio but where do we go from here?\n\nPost Dividend Suspension\n\nAs I have said in the past , you're going to get honest and frank information from me; the good and the bad. In July, our Board of Directors made the decision to suspend our dividend to conserve cash during what we continue to expect will be a tumultuous economic period, as evidenced by the August 5, 2024, market crash. The economic \"pull-back\" that we're witnessing, and which seems to be increasing, has only reassured me that our proactive course of action will put our company in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities that present themselves.\n\nHowever, since suspending our dividend, our company's stock price has drastically declined to an all-time low, which I believe is severely below its intrinsic value. We suspended our dividend because we believe it is the right strategy for long-term value creation and sustainability. It should also be noted that we're not the only REIT suspending or reducing dividends in this market. But if the dividend is the sole reason someone has invested in GIPR, then I understand their dissatisfaction during this temporary period. Don't get me wrong, I too like when a company is able to pay a sustainable dividend, but I have a much different view of our company than immediate income. I continue to choose to invest in GIPR because I believe our company is one of the few public net lease REITs that can provide meaningful growth in a fairly stable industry.\n\nMy goal is to build a company that is not simply stable but that can be transformative for long-term growth. Stability is not growth. Stability is not implementing ingenuities. We have to think differently than our much larger peers. That is why we target short-term, investment grade tenanted net lease assets in strong markets around the country. We purchase assets that most other investors don't and then we spend a tremendous amount of time and relational capital to increase the lease term, renew leases, re-tenant properties at higher rents and create value that is normally not prevalent with the net lease industry. I hope you look at some of our case studies to see how we've repeatedly done this for several of our assets.\n\nThere are many other companies that can provide you with a stable dividend, but I expect that most analysts would argue that growth in those institutions is much more challenging than the possibility that GIPR gives shareholders.\n\nHowever, you're probably wondering when we can reverse our dividend decision. That discussion includes the necessary steps to reinstating our dividend when the time comes. I wish I could give you a specific time that will occur, but I can't because I do not know. However, I can assure you that the decision will be based on an amalgamation of economic policy decisions, portfolio growth, cost of capital congruent with a fully covered dividend and other factors that go into the discussion of increasing the health of our organization.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOur goal remains the same, to provide long-term growth for our investors and be able to pay a 100% covered dividend. Our commitment to you is that we will strive to make decisions that show a clear tie to making those goals a reality in as short a time frame as possible. We're closely monitoring this dislocated market, and I am happy to announce that pricing for the assets we target is finally falling into our favor which is a benefit to everyone involved in our company.\n\nWe will continue to communicate with you, continue to be patient when the market calls for patience, continue to take calculated risks for the benefit of our shareholders and endeavor to grow GIPR for your generations.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid Sobelman\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office, and industrial net lease properties in densely populated submarkets.

Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" and \"project\" and other similar words and expressions are intended to signify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Please refer to the risks detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024, as well as other filings on Form 10-Q and periodic filings on Form 8-K, for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law._\n\n**Notice Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our reported results and net earnings per diluted share, which are financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains and may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Core Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\"), Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"Core AFFO\"), and Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"). We believe the use of Core FFO, Core AFFO and NOI are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and related measures, including NOI, should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. You should not consider our Core FFO, Core AFFO, or NOI as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below.\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets** **(Unaudited)**\n\n**As of June 30,** |  **As of December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**_Assets_**  \n**Investment in real estate**  \nLand |  $ |  21,236,021 |  $ |  21,996,902  \nBuilding and site improvements |  64,800,757 |  71,621,499  \nAcquired tenant improvements |  2,072,205 |  2,072,205  \nAcquired lease intangible assets |  9,927,046 |  10,571,331  \nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization |  (9,900,184 |  ) |  (8,855,332 |  )  \nNet real estate investments |  88,135,845 |  97,406,605  \nCash and cash equivalents |  2,553,234 |  3,117,446  \nRestricted cash |  34,500 |  34,500  \nDeferred rent asset |  392,795 |  1,106,191  \nPrepaid expenses |  367,331 |  139,941  \nPrepaid guaranty fees - related party |  96,360 |  -  \nAccounts receivable |  266,834 |  241,166  \nEscrow deposits and other assets |  775,351 |  493,393  \nHeld for sale assets |  5,750,250 |  -  \nRight of use asset, net |  6,121,340 |  6,152,174  \n**Total Assets** |  **$** |  **104,493,840** |  **$** |  **108,691,416**  \n**_Liabilities and Equity_**  \n**Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  328,725 |  $ |  406,772  \nAccrued expenses |  862,986 |  688,146  \nAccrued expense - related party |  683,347 |  683,347  \nAcquired lease intangible liabilities, net |  948,290 |  1,016,260  \nInsurance payable |  260,182 |  34,966  \nDeferred rent liability |  180,168 |  260,942  \nLease liability, net |  6,439,175 |  6,415,041  \nOther payable - related party |  904,920 |  1,809,840  \nLoan payable - related party |  5,500,000 |  5,500,000  \nMortgage loans, net of unamortized debt discount of $1,230,802 and $1,326,362 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and debt issuance costs |  56,273,271 |  56,817,310  \nDerivative liabilities |  119,029 |  537,424  \nTotal liabilities |  72,500,093 |  74,170,048  \n**Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests** |  22,527,046 |  18,812,423  \n**Preferred Stock - Series A Redeemable Preferred stock, net,**  \n$0.01 par value, 2,400,000 shares authorized, issued, and outstanding at December 31, 2023 with liquidation preferences of $5 per share and no shares authorized or issued in 2022 |  - |  11,637,616  \n**Stockholders' Equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized; 5,419,855 and 2,620,707 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively |  54,232 |  26,207  \nAdditional paid-in capital |  29,034,608 |  18,472,049  \nAccumulated deficit |  (20,015,000 |  ) |  (14,833,058 |  )  \nTotal Generation Income Properties, Inc.

Basic & Diluted** |  **5,433,833** |  **2,615,471** |  **4,923,004** |  **2,578,678**  \n  \nOur reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets, and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\n\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\n\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\n**_Investor Contacts_**\n\nInvestor Relationsir@gipreit.com\n\n**SOURCE:** Generation Income Properties\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/901936/generation-income-properties-announces-second-quarter-2024-financial-and-operating-results) on accesswire.com \n\nReleased August 15, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.gipreit.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### We keep a **generational** outlook in mind.

It's easy to convey a good-news message to anyone at any time, but it's better stewardship to be able to provide accountability and service when delivering the more challenging news.\n\nI have made a concerted effort to develop and foster peer-to-peer relationships with my net lease REIT CEO counterparts and to communicate regularly with industry insiders to \"trade notes\" on what is happening in today's markets. To be frank, we're all experiencing the same thing; high interest rates, smaller spreads between the interest rates and acquisition cap rates, push-back from the capital markets, raising less or no new capital and not seeing an end to the dislocation between buyers and sellers. Overall, it's just a tough market.\n\nDespite our collective challenges, our company's portfolio is performing as planned, rent collection is at 100%, and we continue to maintain direct communication with our tenants to gain intelligence on their companies as well as their performance at our locations. We have signed new leases with credit-worthy tenants, and we have extended leases with incumbent companies who are performing well at our locations.\n\nAdditionally, we remain comfortable with our in-place leverage at lower loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) and fixed interest rates, and we have been maintaining and growing our lender relationships with the understanding that our platform is one that is conservative and has a large growth potential. However, with national economic pressures usually comes challenging market conditions and we believe we should proactively prepare for bumpy roads ahead.\n\nDividend\n\nWe're closely monitoring the economic data and we are witnessing fallout in various forms within our industry and our economy. The subsequent consequences are that many of our colleagues within our industry are either leaving their long-held roles or involuntarily being laid off, which is a dynamic that we're paying particularly close attention to. Additionally, some retailers have announced major store closings for large portions of their operating locations, as they are disclosing that their financial pressures are too much to bear. Thankfully, we believe that GIPR is well-positioned to weather these challenging markets in light of our efficient use of human capital resources and our management team's focus on positioning our company for substantial growth.\n\nHowever, out of an abundance of caution, our Board of Directors, has determined that it is in the best interest of our company and its shareholders to temporarily suspend the company's dividend in order to employ the capital to sustain our company's growth trajectory during this challenging economic market environment.\n\nConserving our cash, which we estimate will equate to roughly $2.54 million annualized, will afford us the opportunity to make strategic acquisitions that can positively impact our long-term growth. We have always made growth and profitability a priority for you and with the challenging capital markets, we believe that we can weather this period better by taking these near-term steps. While it is not anticipated that any dividend distributions will be required this year in order to maintain our status as a REIT, if any such dividends are required, we expect to make the required distributions in a timely manner in order to maintain REIT status.\n\nYour Company's Intrinsic Value\n\nYou should know that REITs are traditionally valued, on a per share basis, differently than more common non-real estate companies. The calculation of our net asset value per share (NAV/share) is a measure that is used to determine value regardless of what we pay out in the form of a dividend. Personally, while I understand the dividend is important to most investors, I put more emphasis on the underlying value of our company's assets, which I believe is a better indicator of the true valuation of our company. To put it simply, we are a company that owns and operates real estate. At March 31, 2024, our company's portfolio was conservatively encumbered by debt at approximately 60% of book value, preferred equity at approximately 16% of book value, and your equity ownership of the portfolio at approximately 24% of book value.\n\nBased on the foregoing and a portfolio book value of approximately $105 million at the company's quarter ended March 31, 2023, GIPRs common shareholder equity was approximately $25 million as of such date. With 5,422,155 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2024, our NAV per share was $4.63. Our thesis is based on purchasing undervalued real estate assets at a discount and realizing the inherent value in those assets by increasing the weighted average lease term (WALT) through renewals and effective management of the assets, which we continually prove that we are accomplishing.\n\nFor example, we purchased a Dollar Tree (Nasdaq: DLTR, S&P: BBB) in Morrow, GA last year with two years remaining on the lease for a going in cap rate of 7.55% (annualized base rent ($103,607)/purchase price ($1,372,278)). Upon taking ownership, we worked with Dollar Tree's corporate real estate team to execute an early lease extension, which gave us a now 6-year remaining lease term. This decreased the cap rate of the asset to approximately 6.5%, from 7.55%, based on current market comparables and therefore has added inherent value to the portfolio that is not reflected in our cost basis. In essence, we estimate that we increased the value of that asset by about $300,000 or roughly 25%.\n\nTherefore, as the above demonstrates, we have continued to extend and renew leases in our portfolio, recognize rental rate increases, and effectively manage both the properties and leases under our ownership, which we believe has led to an appreciation in value for our portfolio that is not reflected in the current book value reported on our company's balance sheet. So, while you may be able to extrapolate an NAV/share value from the company's financial statements based on historical cost, we believe there is inherent value being built day to day in the portfolio that far exceeds that NAV/share price, which will continue to grow as we effectively manage the portfolio and market conditions stabilize.\n\nAn Emphasis on \"WHY\"\n\nAll of this to say, while the dividend may for many of you be the driving motivation behind your investment in GIPR, you should know that we believe the inherent value of the real estate portfolio underlying your investment far exceeds what is reflected in the current share price and such value is not impacted by dividend policies nor daily public market fluctuations. In essence, the dividend does not impact the calculation of the intrinsic value of GIPR's real estate assets.\n\nThese are tough decisions that we have contemplated for some time, but we had to evaluate all our options and while we have enough cash on hand to pay a dividend through the end of fiscal 2024, I expect that the impetus behind investing in GIPR was not to have your investment used to simply pay cash back to you. Building a portfolio that produces stable income and having that cash flow translate to a stable dividend that can grow over time has been, and remains, the focus for our entire team. We have taken the decision to focus on long-term growth for our company, your equity and ultimately the dividend rather than paying out an inflated return that, to be frank, is not currently sustainable over the long-term or financially responsible.\n\nWhat We're Doing in the Meantime\n\nWe are not \"sitting on our hands\" to wait for the markets to be more in our favor…quite the contrary. We are actively growing, repositioning different aspects of capital and operations and preparing to go \"all-in\" when appropriate. Below is an outline of some of the work we've done in the second quarter and in the near-term:\n\n  * Capital Infusion\n\n  \n---  \nWe signed an agreement and successfully funded a capital contribution to the company of $2.5 million. This money is currently in our operating account and will allow us to build on our cash balance as well as continue to structure acquisitions for future growth.  \n  \n  * Debt extension\n\n  \nWe have some debt coming due at the end of 2024 and we are in active conversations with the lender to extend the debt to be commensurate with our current lease durations at the properties securing the debt, which have over 4 years remaining.  \n  \n  * Acquisitions\n\n  \nWe are in active conversations on several acquisition opportunities of various sizes and structures that we hope to be able to share with the market in the near term to not only give you a look behind the curtain on our day-to-day work in the company but to show the opportunities we are continuing to be able to uncover in this challenging market.  \n  \n  * Industry Outreach\n\n  \nGIPR was invited by the New York Stock Exchange to attend a meeting that they hosted focused on the issues pertaining to REITs in today's current market environment. Additionally, while in NY, we attended the National Association for Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) conference where we were able to sit down with six different investment banks and lenders to discuss growth opportunities for our company.  \n  \nOur Plan Going Forward\n\nGIPR is currently in various stages of conversations with landlords, tenants, capital providers, lenders, and investment banks that are part of the different aspects of the growth of GIPR. While we are always open to adding to our portfolio, even at one property at a time, it is clear our time is better spent working on larger portfolio transactions, as we did in 2023, to add scale to the portfolio as well as garner better pricing due to economies of scale.\n\nMethods of growth that we plan to use during this period where markets are challenging are:\n\n  * Portfolio Acquisitions\n\n  * Portfolio Contributions (UPREITs)\n\n  * Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you can imagine an endurance athlete in an athletic event, they've probably experienced a level of struggle that made them have a talk with themself to decide whether they could go beyond what is comfortable. That \"dark place\" where their brain is sending the signals that there is physiological pain being inflicted is ultimately forcing them into a choice. The decision comes down to them and they must contemplate some semblance of, \"will you choose to continue to endure the pain for an indeterminant amount of time? And if so, can you withstand that pain long enough to suddenly look up and realize that you've reached the finish line?\"\n\nFor GIPR, there is no \"finish line\" but I drive the culture to express to our team that I hope we are consistently in an uncomfortable place. The mindset that \"when things get challenging, you embrace the challenge!\" This is where we are today. This will get us through this period.\n\nOur service to you, our shareholders, is to find every avenue to make this company as successful as possible. With our mission \"To improve the lives of all stakeholders for generations\" at the forefront of our efforts, we are looking forward to getting beyond this period, but embracing the challenges until that day comes.\n\nThank you,\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/cec55988-3f11-4a9b-be2b-4114ab70e435/885000/picture1.png)\n\nDave\n\n**About Generation Income Properties**\n\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida, is an internally managed real estate investment trust formed to acquire and own, directly and jointly, real estate investments focused on retail, office and industrial net lease properties located primarily in densely populated submarkets throughout the United States.

Per Northmarq there is an approximate 75\n03\nbasis point discount between net lease assets with 5 years or less remaining in lease term\nversus 10 years or more remaining\nGIPR looks to take advantage of both market opportunity and basis point spread by\n04\nacquiring shorter term leased assets at a discount and renewing and extending leases to\nlead to effectively 10 year plus lease terms\n07\nC U R R E N T B U Y I N G O P P O R T U N I T I E S\nGIPR anticipates that market dynamics in 2025 and 2026 will create more favorable\n01 buying opportunities. The following data highlights three critical factors influencing the\ntransaction market: transaction volume, trends in cap rates, and trends in interest rates.\nTraditionally, transaction volumes have remained high, cap rates have stayed low,\nindicating that net lease properties have been trading at a premium, and interest rates\n02 have reached historic lows. However, due to Federal Reserve policies, interest rates rose\nsharply between 2022 and 2024, resulting in a slowdown in transaction volumes and a\ngradual increase in cap rates.\nThe latest data suggests that the market is beginning to recalibrate toward a more\nfavorable buying environment, with cap rates stabilizing at higher levels and interest rates\n03\ndecreasing. This shift may lead to a positive basis point spread between cap rates and the\ncost of capital, signaling promising investment opportunities ahead.\nSee the graph on the following page for illustration\n04\n08\nC U R R E N T B U Y I N G O P P O R T U N I T I E S\n2021 2022-2024 2025\nHigh transaction volume Decreasing transaction volume Low transaction volume\nLow cap rates Slowly increasing cap rates Sustained high cap rates\nLow cost of capital Rapidly increasing cost of capital Decreasing cost of capital\nBuying opportunity for GIPR Patient and disciplined GIPR investing Greater buying opportunity for GIPR\n09\nG I P R T H E S I S V A L I D A T E D - E X A M P L E S O F 2 0 2 4\nFresenius Medical Care Dollar Tree Armed Services YMCA\nChicago, IL Morrow, GA Norfolk, VA\nAcquisition Details: Acquisition Details: Acquisition Details:\nPurchase Price: $3,100,000 Purchase Price: $1,372,278 Purchase Price: $11,800,000\n7.24% cap rate 7.55% cap rate Annual Gross Rent: $1,237,111\n2 LYR Leased by two Investment Grade Credit\nExtension Details: $103,607 NOI Tenants:\nSeven-Year Extension United States General Service Admin., &\nExtension Details: Maersk Line Limited\nFive-Year Extension\nNew Value: New Value: New Tenant/ Lease Details:\nThe lease extension brought the total Lease extension brought the total remaining GIPR overcame MAERSK Line Limited vacating\nremaining lease term for this Fresenius lease term for this Dollar Tree property to the property (approximately 35,000 SF) to re-\nproperty to nine (9) years.

You should carefully consider\nthese risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:\n•We have limited operating history and may not be able to successfully operate our business or generate sufficient operating cash flows to make or sustain distributions to\nour stockholders, and we currently own only twenty-five leased properties.\n•Many of our current and future properties depend upon a single tenant for all or a majority of the rental income, and our financial condition and ability to make\ndistributions may be adversely affected by the bankruptcy or insolvency, a downturn in the business, or a lease termination of a single tenant.\n•We have experienced losses in the past, and we will likely experience similar losses in the near future.\n•We may change our investment objectives without seeking stockholder approval.\n•We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.\n•If we cannot obtain additional capital, our ability to make acquisitions and lease properties will be limited.\n•The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for GIP SPE contains provisions that could significantly impede our operations and our ability to\nefficiently manage our business and that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n•We may never reach sufficient size to achieve diversity in our portfolio.\n•Because of our holding company structure, we depend on our Operating Partnership subsidiary and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally subordinated\nin right of payment to the obligations of such Operating Partnership subsidiary and its subsidiaries.\n•We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\n•You will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them.\n•The loss of any of our executive officers could adversely affect our ability to continue operations.\n•We rely on information technology networks and systems in conducting our business, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that\ntechnology could harm our business.\n•We have paid and may continue to pay distributions from offering proceeds to the extent our cash flow from operations or earnings are not sufficient to fund declared\ndistributions. Rates of distribution to you will not necessarily be indicative of our operating results. If we make distributions from sources other than our cash flows from\noperations or earnings, we will have fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and your overall return may be reduced.\n•Our structure may result in potential conflicts of interest with limited partners in our Operating Partnership whose interests may not be aligned with those of our\nstockholders.\n•The third party valuations of real estate investments we seek to purchase often times includes the value of a commercial lease and the loss of such a lease could result in\nthe value of the real property declining.\n•Our operating results will be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.\n•If a major tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under its leases, which would have a harmful effect on our financial condition and\nability to pay distributions to you.\n•We own twenty-three of our properties through preferred equity partnerships, which may lead to disagreements with our partners and adversely affect our interest in the\npartnerships.\n•If a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant’s bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\n•We may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property and would have only limited recourse in the event our due diligence did not identify any issues that\nlower the value of our property.\n•Our real estate investments may include special use single-tenant properties that may be difficult to sell or re-lease upon lease terminations.\n•We may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements, build outs or capital needs, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our\nstockholders.\n•Our inability to sell a property when we desire to do so could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to you.\n4\n•We may not be able to sell our properties at a price equal to, or greater than, the price for which we purchased such property, which may lead to a decrease in the value of\nour assets.\n•We may acquire or finance properties with lock-out provisions, which may prohibit us from selling a property, or may require us to maintain specified debt levels for a\nperiod of years on some properties.\n•Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions.\n•Increased vacancy rates could have an adverse impact on our ability to make distributions and the value of an investment in our shares.\n•If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.\n•We could be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to investments to which we take title.\n•CC&Rs may restrict our ability to operate a property.\n•Our properties may face competition that could reduce the amount of rent paid to us, which would reduce the cash available for distributions and the amount of\ndistributions.\n•We may not be able to re-lease or renew leases at our properties on terms favorable to us or at all.\n•Lease defaults, terminations or landlord-tenant disputes may adversely reduce our income from our property portfolio.\n•We have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which\nincreases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.\n•High levels of debt or increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our loan payments, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders.\n•High mortgage rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties.\n•Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to you.\n•The Company's failure to continue to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions.\n•In certain circumstances, we may be subject to federal and state income taxes as a REIT, which would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.\n•REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nNote Regarding Market and Industry Data\nIn this Form10-K, we present certain market and industry data and statistics. This information is based on third-party sources, which we believe to be reliable. We have not\nindependently verified data from these sources and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding industry data\nprovided herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon various factors, including those discussed in this Annual Report under\n“Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” Additionally, some data in this Annual Report is based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from\nmanagement’s knowledge of the industry and independent sources. Similarly, we believe our internal research is reliable, however, such research has not been verified by any\nindependent sources.\n5\nPART I.\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Company\nWe are an internally managed real estate investment trust focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail, office and industrial properties net leased to high quality\ntenants in major markets throughout the United States. We believe our focus on owning properties leased to investment grade or creditworthy tenants provide attractive risk\nadjusted returns through current yields, long term appreciation and tenant renewals.\nWe believe that single-tenant commercial properties, as compared with shopping centers, malls, and other traditional multi-tenant properties, offer a distinct investment\nadvantage since single-tenant properties generally require less management and operating capital and generally have less recurring tenant turnover.\nGiven the stability and predictability of the cash flows, many net leased properties are held in family trusts, providing us an opportunity to acquire these properties for tax\ndeferred units while giving the owners potential liquidity through the conversion of the units for freely tradable shares of stock.\nWe make regular cash distributions to our stockholders out of our cash available for distribution, typically on a monthly basis. Generally, our policy will be to pay distributions\nfrom cash flow from operations. However, our distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, such as from the proceeds from a capital raise,\nborrowings or distributions in kind.\nWe have been organized as a Maryland corporation and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under U.S. federal income\ntax laws since the beginning of our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP TRS Inc. in 2022 to operate as a taxable REIT\nsubsidiary but this subsidiary does not hold any assets or business operations as of the date of this Form 10-K.\nWe and our Operating Partnership were organized to operate using an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (“UPREIT”) structure. We use an UPREIT structure\nbecause a sale of property directly to another person or entity generally is a taxable transaction to the selling property owner. In an UPREIT structure, a seller of a property that\ndesires to defer taxable gain on the sale of its property may transfer the property to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common units in the Operating Partnership and\ndefer taxation of gain until the seller later disposes of its common units in the Operating Partnership. Using an UPREIT structure may give us an advantage in acquiring desired\nproperties from persons who may not otherwise sell their properties because of unfavorable tax results. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by, and operations are\nconducted through, the Operating Partnership or its direct or indirect subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, we owned\n90.7% of the outstanding common units in the Operating Partnership and outside investors owned 9.3%. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC as\na wholly owned subsidiary in 2018 that owned 0.002% of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2023.\nThe following chart shows the structure of the Company as of December 31, 2023:\n6\n(1) Until August 8, 2023 The Brown Family owned redeemable liability company interests in GIPNC 199 N Etheridge Road LLC. The Company has since purchased the Brown\nFamily's interest and as of the reporting date owns 100% of the entity.\n(2) Until August 8, 2023 Richard Hornstrom and Stephen Brown owned redeemable limited liability company member interests in GIPFL 702 Tillman Place LLC. The Company\nhas purchased each of Mr. Hornstrom and Mr. Brown’s interests, in full, and as of the reporting date, owns 100% of the entity.\n(3) Until September 7, 2023 Richard Hornstrom owned a redeemable limited liability company interest in GIPIL 525 S Perryville Rd, LLC. The Company has since purchased Mr.\nHornstrom’s interest and as of the reporting date owns 100% of the entity.\n(4) On August 10, 2023 the company acquired a 13 property portfolio, now GIP13, LLC, from Modiv Inc. for a purchase price of $42 million. The acquired portfolio consists of\neleven (11) retail and two (2) office properties.\nBusiness Objectives and Investment Strategy\nWe intend to continue to acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of high-quality net leased properties that generates predictable cash flows and capital appreciation over\nmarket cycles. Our properties are generally net leased to a single tenant. Under a net lease, the tenant typically bears the responsibility for most or all property related expenses\nsuch as real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. We believe this lease structure provides us with stable cash flows over the term of the lease and minimizes the\nongoing capital expenditures. We seek to identify properties in submarkets with high barriers to entry for development and where valuation is frequently influenced by local real\nestate market conditions and tenant needs\nFocus on Real Estate Fundamentals: We have observed that the market for properties with bond type net leased structures, lease terms greater than ten years, and limited rent\nescalators upon renewal are exposed to many of the same operational and market risks as other net leased properties while providing lower returns due to competition. We\nbelieve that focusing on traditional real estate fundamentals allows us to target properties with shorter lease terms, modified net leases or vacancy and thereby may allow us to\ngenerate superior returns.\nTarget Markets with Attractive Characteristics: We concentrate our investment activity in select target markets with the following characteristics: high quality infrastructure,\ndiversified local economies with multiple economic drivers, strong demographics, pro-business local governments and high-quality local labor pools. We believe that these\nmarkets offer a higher probability of producing long term rent growth and capital appreciation.\nTarget Strategic Net Leased Properties: We target properties that offer unique strategic advantages to a tenant or an industry and can therefore be acquired at attractive yields\nrelative to the underlying risk. We look for properties that are difficult or costly to replicate due to a specific location, special zoning, unique physical attributes, below market\nrents or a significant tenant investment in the facility, all of\n7\nwhich contribute to a higher probability of tenant renewals. An example of a specialized property is our General Services Administration occupied building in Norfolk, Virginia\ndue to the tenant’s buildout for IT and security. We target properties if we believe they are critical to the ongoing operations of the tenant and the profitability of its business.\nWe believe that the profitability of the operations and the difficulty in replicating or moving operations reflect the importance of the property to the tenant’s business.\nTarget Investments that Maximize Growth Potential: We focus on net leased investment properties where, in our view, there is the potential to invest incremental capital to\naccommodate a tenant’s business, extend lease terms and increase the value of a property. We believe these opportunities can generate attractive returns due to the nature of our\nrelationship with the tenant.\nDisciplined Underwriting & Risk Management\nWe actively manage and regularly review each of our properties for changes in the underlying business, credit of the tenant and market conditions. Before acquiring a property,\nwe review the terms of the management contract to ensure our team is able to maximize cash flow capital appreciation through potential lease renewals and/or potential re-\ntenanting. Additionally, we monitor any required capital improvements that would lead to increased rental income or capital appreciation over time. We focus on active\nmanagement with the tenants upon the acquisition of an asset since our experience in the single-tenant, commercial real estate industry indicates that active management and\nfostering tenant relationships has the potential to positively impact long-term financial outcomes, such as:\n•better communication with corporate level and unit level staff to determine ongoing company and location-specific performance, strategic goals and directives;\n•the ability to hold a tenant accountable for property maintenance during occupancy in order to reduce the probability of future deferred maintenance expenses; and\n•the ability to develop relationships with tenants as an active participant in their occupancy which can lead to better communication during times of potential negotiations.\nUnderwriting Process\nOur extensive underwriting process evaluates key fundamental value drivers that we believe will attract long-term tenants and result in property appreciation over time. Our\nInvestment Committee is comprised of the following members:\n•Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), David Sobelman, who has over 19 years in different capacities within the net lease commercial real estate\ninvestment market including as investor, asset manager, broker, owner, analyst, and advisor.\n•Vice President of Accounting and Finance (\"VP Accounting\"), Ron Cook, who has over 20 years in various capacities within commercial real estate investment and\nfinance.\n•Emily Hewland, Director of Capital Markets, who has been with the Company since inception and she has built out our acquisitions process to effectively underwrite\nassets thoroughly to find value in the market for investors and the portfolio alike.\n•Acquisitions Manager, Robert Rorhlack, who sources new acquisition opportunities that adhere to our investment criteria, and who has previously specialized in Tenant\nRepresentation.\nThis comprehensive pre-ownership analysis helps us to assess location level performance, including the possible longevity of tenant occupancy throughout the primary lease\nterm and option periods. Additionally, each acquisition pursuit requires approval from all four members of the Investment Committee.\nWe assess target markets and properties using an extensive underwriting and evaluation process, including:\n•offering materials review;\n•property and tenant lease information;\n•in depth conversations with offering agent, local brokers and property management companies;\n•thorough credit underwriting of the tenant;\n•review of tenant’s historical performance in the specific market and their nationwide trend to determine potential longevity of the asset and tenant’s business model;\n•market real estate dynamics, including macroeconomic market data and market rents for potential rental rate changes after initial lease term;\n•evaluation of business trends for local real estate demand specifics and competing business locations;\n•review of asset level financial performance;\n8\n•pre-acquisition discussions with the asset manager to confirm property specific reserve amounts and potential future capital expenditures;\n•review of property’s physical condition and related systems; and\n•financial modeling to determine our preliminary baseline pricing.\n•Specific acquisition criteria may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n•premier locations and facilities with multiple alternative uses;\n•sustainable rents specific to a tenants’ location that may be at or below market rents;\n•investment grade or strong credit tenant;\n•properties not subject to long-term management contracts with management companies;\n•opportunities to expand the tenants’ building and/or implement value-added operational improvements; and\n•population density and strong demand growth characteristics supported by favorable demographic indicators.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that the following factors benefit the Company as we implement our business strategy:\n•Focused Property Investment Strategy. We have invested and intend to invest primarily in assets that are geographically located in prime markets throughout the United\nStates, with an emphasis on the major primary and coastal markets, where we believe there are greater barriers to entry for the development of new net lease properties.\n•Experienced Board of Directors. We believe that we have a seasoned and experienced board of directors that will help us achieve our investment objectives. In\ncombination, our directors have approximately 140 years of experience in the real estate industry.\n•Real Estate Industry Leadership and Networking. We are led by our Chairman, President and CEO, David Sobelman. He founded the Company after serving in different\ncapacities within the net lease commercial real estate market. Mr. Sobelman started his real estate career in 2003 as a real estate analyst and ultimately emerged into a\nManaging Partner of a solely-focused, triple net lease commercial real estate firm. He has procured or overseen numerous transactions that ranged from small, private\ninvestments to portfolio transactions with individual aggregate values of approximately $69 million. Additionally, Mr. Sobelman considers himself a pioneer in\nimplementing hands-on management of net leased properties in order to potentially maintain or increase the value of any one asset. He has overseen or actively\nparticipated in single tenant real estate management since 2010.\n•Established and Developing Relationships with Real Estate Financing Sources. We believe our existing relationships with institutional sources of debt financing could\nprovide us with more attractive and competitive debt financing options as we grow our property portfolio and provide us the opportunity to refinance our existing\nindebtedness.\n•Existing Acquisition Pipeline. We believe our extensive network of long standing relationships will continue to provide us with access to a pipeline of acquisition\nopportunities that will enable us to identify and capitalize on what we believe are attractive acquisition opportunities for our leasing efforts.\n•Growth-Oriented, Flexible and Conservative Capital Structure. We believe our capital structure will provide us with an advantage over many of our private and public\ncompetitors. We have no legacy balance sheet issues and limited near-term maturities, which will allow management to focus on business and growth strategies rather\nthan balance sheet repair.\nFinancing Strategies\nOur long-term goal is to maintain a lower-leveraged capital structure and lower outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness. Over time, we intend to reduce\nour debt positions through financing our long-term growth with equity issuances and some debt financing having staggered maturities. Our debt may include mortgage debt\nsecured by our properties and unsecured debt. Over a long-term period, we intend to maintain lower levels of debt encumbering the Company, its assets and/or the portfolio as\ncompared to our current leverage.\nOur Current Portfolio as of December 31, 2023\nThe following are characteristics of our properties as of December 31, 2023:\n•Creditworthy Tenants. Approximately 68% of our portfolio’s annualized rent as of December 31, 2023 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company\nhas) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of “BBB-”\n9\nor better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, and the City of San Antonio, who collectively contributed approximately 39% of our\nportfolio’s annualized base rent as of December 31, 2023.\n•96% Occupied. Our portfolio is 96% leased and occupied.\n•Contractual Rent Growth. 84% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2023) provide for increases in contractual base\nrent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n•Average Effective Annual Rental per Square Foot. Average effective annual rental per square foot is $16.02.\nGiven the nature of our leases, our tenants either pay the real estate taxes or insurance directly or reimburse us for such costs.

There is no assurance that any currently available properties in our acquisition pipeline will remain available, or that we will pursue or complete potential\nacquisitions, at prices acceptable to us or at all.\n10\nProperty and Asset Management Agreements\nWe manage our properties in-house, except for our Norfolk, Virginia properties and our Maitland, Florida property.\nWe previously engaged Colliers International Asset Services to provide property management services to our two properties in Norfolk, Virginia. The agreements provided for\nus to pay Colliers International Asset Services a management fee equal to 2.5% of the gross collected rent of each of the two properties (inclusive of tenant expense\nreimbursements) as well as a construction supervision fee for any approved construction. On May 31, 2022, the Company terminated the agreement with Colliers International\nAsset Services effective June 30, 2022. The Company engaged Bevara Building Services for facility management and property management services for the two Norfolk,\nVirginia properties from June 15, 2022 through July 2023. Effective August 2023 Colliers International Asset Services resumed management services for our Norfolk, VA\nproperties for an aggregate of approximately $42,000 annually, as well as, for our Maitland, Florida property for approximately $24,000 annually.\nDistributions\nFrom inception through December 31, 2023, we have distributed $3,872,035 to common stockholders. In addition, on January 3, 2024, we announced that our Board of\nDirectors authorized a distribution of $0.039 per share monthly cash distribution for shareholders of record of our common stock as of January 15, 2024, February 15, 2024 and\nMarch 15, 2024. January and February distributions were paid on January 30, 2024, February 29, 2024 and March 29, 2024, respectively. Because we have not yet generated a\ncumulative profit, distributions have been made from proceeds from prior capital raises.\nCompetition\nThe net lease industry is highly competitive. We compete to acquire properties with other investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and\ninstitutional investment funds, many of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more\nrisk than we can prudently manage. This competition increases the demand for the types of properties in which we wish to invest and, therefore, reduces the number of suitable\nacquisition opportunities available to us and increases the prices paid for such acquisition. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive\nrelative to other forms of investment.\nAs a landlord, we compete for tenants in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own\nproperties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. Many of our competitors have greater economies of scale, access to more resources and\ngreater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we charge our tenants, we may lose our\ntenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination\nrights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023 we had four full-time employees. We plan to use outside consultants, attorneys, and accountants, as necessary. We endeavor to maintain workplaces\nthat are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or\nexpression or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement is a person’s qualifications,\nperformance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance.\nEnvironmental Matters\nTo control costs, we limit our investments to properties that are environmentally compliant or that do not require extensive remediation upon acquisition. To do this, we conduct\nassessments of properties before we decide to acquire them. These assessments, however, may not reveal all environmental hazards. In certain instances we rely upon the\nexperience of our management and n most cases we will request, but will not always obtain, a representation from the seller that, to its knowledge, the property is not\ncontaminated with hazardous materials. Additionally, we seek to ensure that many of our leases contain clauses that require a tenant to reimburse and indemnify us for any\nenvironmental contamination occurring at the property. We do not intend to purchase any properties that have known environmental deficiencies that cannot be remediated.\nFederal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under these laws\nand regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or\npetroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation,\ncleanup and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and\n11\nliability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint\nand several for the full amount of the investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and\nseverally liable may seek to obtain contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties of their fair share toward these costs. In addition, under the environmental\nlaws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require that a person or company who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator,\nmust pay for the cleanup of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment. Any of these cleanup costs may be substantial, and can\nexceed the value of the property. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner,\noperator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral, and may adversely impact our investment in that property.\nFurthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to\nasbestos while occupying a net lease may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a\nproperty or place conditions on various activities. An example would be laws that require a business using chemicals (such as swimming pool chemicals at a net lease property)\nto manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used.\nWe could be responsible for any of the costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws\ncould be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our shareholders. Prior to any acquisition of property, we will seek to obtain environmental\nsite assessments to identify any environmental concerns at the property. However, these environmental site assessments may not reveal all environmental costs that might have\na harmed our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities.\nAs a result, we may become subject to material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware. We can make no assurances that (1) future laws or regulations will not\nimpose material environmental liabilities on us, or (2) the environmental condition of our net lease properties will not be affected by the condition of the properties in the\nvicinity of our net lease properties (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us.\nInsurance\nWe require our tenant, up to the limits stated in our leases, to maintain liability and property insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to net leases.\nPursuant to the leases, our tenants may be required to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their\nliability policies and additional named insured and/or loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. All tenants are required to maintain\ncasualty coverage. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance\npolicies that are held by our tenants with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a catastrophic nature,\nsuch as those caused by wind/hail, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to any of our properties\nthat is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for any indebtedness, even if these properties are\nirreparably damaged. In addition to being a named insured on our tenants’ liability policies, we intend to separately maintain commercial general liability coverage with an\naggregate limit of $2,000,000. We also intend to maintain full property coverage on all untenanted properties and any other property coverage required by any of our lenders\nthat is not required to be carried by our tenants under our leases.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a)\nand 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

RISK FACTORS\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether\ncurrently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results\nof operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be\nconsidered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of\nrisk factors contains forward-looking statements.\n12\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Properties\nWe have limited operating history and may not be able to successfully operate our business or generate sufficient operating cash flows to make or sustain\ndistributions to our stockholders.\nWe were organized in September 2015 for the purpose of acquiring and investing in freestanding, single-tenant commercial properties net leased to investment grade tenants.\nWe commenced operations as soon as we were able to raise sufficient funds to acquire our first suitable property. However, our ability to make or sustain distributions to our\nstockholders will depend on many factors, including our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities that satisfy our investment strategy, our success in consummating\nacquisitions on favorable terms, the level and volatility of interest rates, readily accessible short-term and long-term financing on favorable terms, and conditions in the financial\nmarkets, the real estate market and the economy. We will face competition in acquiring attractive net lease properties. The value of the net lease properties that we acquire may\ndecline substantially after we purchase them. We may not be able to successfully operate our business or implement our operating policies and investment strategy successfully.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our operating expenses and make distributions to our stockholders.\nAs an early-stage company, we are subject to the risks of any early stage business enterprise, including risks that we will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel,\ncreate effective operating and financial controls and systems or effectively manage our anticipated growth, any of which could have a harmful effect on our business and our\noperating results.\nWe currently own twenty-six properties.\nAs of March 29, 2024, we own twenty-six properties. We will need to raise funds to acquire additional properties to lease in order to grow and generate additional revenue.\nBecause we only own twenty-six properties, the loss of any one tenant (or financial difficulties experienced by one of our tenants) could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and operations.\nMany of our current and future properties depend upon a single tenant for all or a majority of the rental income, and our financial condition and ability to make\ndistributions may be adversely affected by the bankruptcy or insolvency, a downturn in the business, or a lease termination of a single tenant.\nCurrent and future properties are occupied by only one tenant or derive a majority of their rental income from one tenant and, therefore, the success of those properties is\nmaterially dependent on the financial stability of such tenants. Lease payment defaults by tenants could cause us to reduce the amount of distributions we pay. A default of a\ntenant on its lease payments to us would cause us to lose the revenue from the property and force us to find an alternative source of revenue to meet any mortgage payment and\nprevent a foreclosure if the property is subject to a mortgage. In the event of a default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial\ncosts in protecting our investment and re-letting the property. If a lease is terminated, there is no assurance that we will be able to lease the property for the rent previously\nreceived or sell the property without incurring a loss. A default by a tenant, the failure of a guarantor to fulfill its obligations or other premature termination of a lease, or a\ntenant’s election not to extend a lease upon its expiration, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pay distributions. For example, one tenant in\none of our Norfolk, Virginia properties and another tenant in our Alabama property did not renew their leases that terminated on January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\nrespectively. Consequently, if we do not timely find replacement tenants for each, it may materially adversely impact our business.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we will likely experience similar losses in the near future.\nFrom inception of the Company through December 31, 2023, we had a cumulative net loss of approximately $14.8 million. Our losses can be attributed, in part, to the initial\nstart-up costs and high corporate general and administrative expenses as a public company relative to the size of our portfolio. In addition, acquisition costs and depreciation and\namortization expenses substantially reduced our income. As we continue to acquire properties, we anticipate we will achieve scale to reduce these expenses; however, we cannot\nassure you that, in the future, we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our assets.\nWe may change our investment objectives without seeking stockholder approval.\nWe may change our investment objectives without stockholder notice or consent. Although our Board has fiduciary duties to our stockholders and intends only to change our\ninvestment objectives when our Board determines that a change is in the best interests of our stockholders, a change in our investment objectives could reduce our payment of\ncash distributions to our stockholders or cause a decline in the value of our investments.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.\nOur investment strategy requires us to identify suitable investment opportunities compatible with our investment criteria. We may not be successful in identifying suitable\nopportunities that meet our criteria or in consummating investments, including those identified as part of our investment pipeline, on satisfactory terms or at all. Our ability to\nmake investments on favorable terms may be constrained by several factors including, but not limited to, competition from other investors with significant capital, including\nnon-traded REITs, publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds, which may significantly increase investment costs; and/or the inability to finance an investment on\nfavorable terms or at all. The failure to identify or consummate investments on satisfactory terms, or at all, may impede our growth and negatively affect our cash available for\ndistribution to our stockholders.\n13\nIf we cannot obtain additional capital, our ability to make acquisitions and lease properties will be limited. We are subject to risks associated with debt and capital\nstock issuances, and such issuances may have adverse consequences to holders of shares of our common stock.\nOur ability to acquire and lease properties will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of\nequity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of shares of our common stock. Our Board may authorize the issuance of classes or series of preferred stock which\nmay have rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of shares of our common stock.\nFurther, we expect to incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may include a new corporate credit facility. Such indebtedness could also have other important\nconsequences to our creditors and holders of our common and preferred stock, including subjecting us to covenants restricting our operating flexibility, increasing our\nvulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and\nother general corporate requirements, requiring the use of a portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby\nreducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements, and limiting our flexibility in planning\nfor, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nThe Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for GIP SPE, entered into by the Operating Partnership and LC2, contains provisions that could\nsignificantly impede our operations and our ability to efficiently manage our business and that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future.\nIn connection with the preferred investment by LC2 in our GIP SPE subsidiary, LC2 has substantial rights under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company\nAgreement for GIP SPE (the “GIP SPE Operating Agreement”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Recent\nDevelopments.”\nGIP SPE is a subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, which holds, directly and indirectly, 21 of our properties, including the properties comprising our portfolio acquisition\nfrom Modiv Industrial and eight of our other properties (collectively, the “Properties”). Under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, the following actions, among others, require\nthe approval of LC2:\n•the adoption and approval of annual operating budgets for the operations and improvements of the Properties; acquiring additional real property or any interest therein;\n•selling, leasing, assigning, pledging, conveying, exchanging, encumbering or otherwise disposing of all or a material portion of the assets of GIP SPE or any of its\nProperties, subject to certain exceptions;\n•amending or waiving any provision of, or otherwise modifying the GIP SPE Operating Agreement;\n•amending, extending or materially modifying any existing lease relating to any of the Properties or entering into any new lease with respect to any of the Properties;\n•admitting, including by assignment of economic rights or permitting encumbrances of membership interests in GIP SPE, any member other than by means of a transfer\npermitted by the GIP SPE Operating Agreement;\n•merging or consolidating GIP SPE with or into another entity, reorganizing GIP SPE, or making a binding commitment to do any of the foregoing;\n•making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, filing a petition in bankruptcy, petitioning or applying to any tribunal for the appointment of a custodian, receiver or\nany trustee for GIP SPE, or a substantial part of any of its properties or assets, or commencing any proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,\nreadjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation law or statute of any jurisdiction;\n•voluntarily dissolving or liquidating GIP SPE;\n•causing GIP SPE to loan any of its funds;\n•except as specifically provided in the agreement, engaging in any Capital Transaction (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement), financing or any Approved\nLoan (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement), or executing or otherwise entering into any loan, guaranty, indemnity or similar agreement by GIP SPE or\nmodifying in any material nature, extending, renewing, changing or prepaying in whole or in part any borrowing, financing, refinancing, indemnity or similar agreement,\nor making any commitments to borrow funds;\n•causing GIP SPE to make, revoke or modify any tax election; and\n•making any change to GIP SPE’s accounting practices or policies that could be material to either GIP SPE or its members.\nGIP SPE’s Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which, in the amount of 5% per annum, is\ndeemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which, in the amount of 10.5% per annum, is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE\nOperating Agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP\n14\nSPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to\nLC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as an amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.\nLC2’s rights under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement may significantly impede our ability to operate our business and manage our Properties. Furthermore, these rights may\nprevent us from engaging in transactions, including change of control or financing transactions, that otherwise would be attractive to us. The foregoing could adversely affect\nour financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the market value of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future.\nWe may never reach sufficient size to achieve diversity in our portfolio.\nWe are presently a comparatively small company with only twenty-six properties, resulting in a portfolio that lacks geographic and tenant diversity. While we intend to\nendeavor to grow and diversify our portfolio through additional property acquisitions, we may never reach a significant size to achieve true portfolio diversity. In addition,\nbecause we intend to focus on single-tenant properties, we may never have a diverse group of tenants renting our properties, which will hinder our ability to achieve overall\ndiversity in our portfolio. As of March 29, 2024, 40% of our total base rent is derived from our office properties and 60% from retail/medical-retail properties.\nThe market for real estate investments is highly competitive.\nIdentifying attractive real estate investment opportunities, particularly in the value-added real estate arena, is difficult and involves a high degree of uncertainty. Furthermore,\nthe historical performance of a particular property or market is not a guarantee or prediction of the property’s or market’s future performance. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities or achieve our investment goal and objectives.\nBecause there are consistently periods of different levels of demand for real estate investments, there may be increased competition among investors to invest in the same asset\nclasses as the Company. This competition may lead to an increase in the investment prices or otherwise less favorable investment terms. If this situation occurs with a particular\ninvestment, our return on that investment is likely to be less than the return it could have achieved if it had invested at a time of less investor competition for the investment.\nWe are required to make a number of judgments in applying accounting policies, and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could\nresult in changes to our reporting of financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments) and various\nreceivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values that may be difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability\nthat may be difficult to accurately predict. While we have identified those accounting policies that are considered critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the\nassociated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes to our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of our holding company structure, we depend on our Operating Partnership subsidiary and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally\nsubordinated in right of payment to the obligations of such Operating Partnership subsidiary and its subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant asset is and will be the general and limited partnership interests in our Operating\nPartnership. We conduct, and intend to conduct, all our business operations through our Operating Partnership. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is\ndistributions from our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows. We cannot assure our stockholders that our Operating Partnership or its\nsubsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to make distributions to our stockholders from cash flows from operations. Each of\nour Operating Partnership's subsidiaries is or will be a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain\ncash from such entities. In addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and\nobligations of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our Operating\nPartnership and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all our and our Operating Partnership's and its subsidiaries' liabilities and\nobligations have been paid in full.\nWe may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational,\ncompliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk\nmonitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the\nspecifics and timing of such outcomes. In addition, with a limited number of employees, our ability to identify risks is limited. Thus, we may, in the course of our activities,\nincur losses due to these risks.\nYou will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them.\nOur investment policies and strategies are very broad and permit us to invest in any type of commercial real estate, including developed and undeveloped properties, entities\nowning these assets or other real estate assets regardless of geographic location or property type. Our CEO along with our Investment Committee has absolute discretion in\nimplementing these policies and strategies, subject to the restrictions on investment objectives and policies set forth in our articles of incorporation. Because you cannot\nevaluate our investments, our securities\n15\nmay entail more risk than other types of investments. This additional risk may hinder your ability to achieve your own personal investment objectives related to portfolio\ndiversification, risk-adjusted investment returns and other objectives.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers could adversely affect our ability to continue operations.\nWe only have four full-time employees and are therefore entirely dependent on the efforts of our CEO and core staff. The departure of any of these employees and our inability\nto find suitable replacements, or the loss of other key personnel in the future, could have a harmful effect on our business.\nOur President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board has guaranteed certain of our indebtedness, which could constitute a conflict of interest.\nOur CEO has guaranteed promissory notes for certain of our property acquisitions. As a guarantor, Mr. Sobelman’s interests with respect to the debt he is guaranteeing (and the\nterms of any repayment or default) may not align with the Company’s interests and could result in a conflict of interest.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems in conducting our business, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that\ntechnology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our\nbusiness processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include confidential information of tenants, lease data and information regarding\nour stockholders. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential\ninformation. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches or cyber-attacks, can create system\ndisruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, any breach in the data security measures employed by any third-party vendors upon\nwhich we may rely, could also result in the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of\ninformation systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have paid and may continue to pay distributions from offering proceeds to the extent our cash flow from operations or earnings are not sufficient to fund declared\ndistributions. Rates of distribution to you will not necessarily be indicative of our operating results. If we make distributions from sources other than our cash flows\nfrom operations or earnings, we will have fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and your overall return may be reduced.\nOur organizational documents permit us to make distributions from any source, including the proceeds from an offering of our securities. To date, we have funded and expect to\ncontinue to fund distributions from the net proceeds of our offerings. We may also fund distributions with borrowings and the sale of assets to the extent distributions exceed our\nearnings or cash flows from operations. While we intend to pay distributions from cash flow from operations, our distributions paid to date were all funded by proceeds from\nour securities offerings. To the extent we fund distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, such distributions may constitute a return of capital and we will\nhave fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and your overall return may be reduced. Further, to the extent distributions exceed our earnings and profits, a\nstockholder’s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder’s basis, the stockholder will be required to recognize capital gain.\nOur structure may result in potential conflicts of interest with limited partners in our Operating Partnership whose interests may not be aligned with those of our\nstockholders.\nOur directors and officers have duties to our corporation and our stockholders under Maryland law and our charter in connection with their management of the corporation. At\nthe same time, we, as general partner, will have fiduciary duties under Delaware law to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners in connection with the management\nof our Operating Partnership. Our duties as general partner of our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to\nour corporation and our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership owes its limited partners the duties of good faith and fair dealing.\nOther duties, including fiduciary duties, may be modified or eliminated in the partnership’s partnership agreement. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership\nprovides that, for so long as we own a controlling interest in our Operating Partnership, any conflict that cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or\nthe limited partners will be resolved in favor of our stockholders.\nAdditionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that we will not be liable or accountable to our Operating Partnership for losses sustained,\nliabilities incurred or benefits not derived if we acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees,\nagents and designees to the extent permitted by applicable law from and against any and all claims arising from operations of our Operating Partnership, unless it is established\nthat: (1) the act or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;\n(2) the indemnified party received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the indemnified person had\nreasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.\nThe provisions of Delaware law that allow the fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been tested in a court of law, and we\nhave not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties.\n16\nPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants' financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our\naccess to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local governments mandated or recommended various actions to reduce or prevent the spread of COVID-19, which\naltered customer behaviors and temporarily limited some of our tenants’ ability to operate. Although our tenants did not requested rent concessions or seek to renegotiate future\nrents based on changes to the economic environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, should federal, state, and local governments mandate or recommend lockdowns again in\nthe future due to a pandemic or other similar health crises, tenants could request rent concessions or seek to renegotiate future rents.\nIn the event of future pandemics or similar health crises, consumers could elect to make more of their purchases online instead of in physical stores and businesses could delay\nexecuting new or renewals of leases amidst the immediate and uncertain economic impacts. These developments, coupled with potential tenant failures and a reduction in\nnewly-formed businesses, could result in decreased demand for rental space, which could result in lower occupancy or higher levels of uncollectible lease income, as well as\ndownward pressure on rents. Additionally, delays in construction of tenant improvements due to the impacts of constraints on supply chains and labor, resulting from\ngovernment ordered lockdowns, could result in delayed rent commencement due to it taking longer for new tenants to open and operate.\nAlthough the vast majority of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments, the ability of certain of our tenants to meet their lease obligations could be negatively\nimpacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of a new virus strain of COVID-19 or any future pandemic or other health crisis. Our tenants' ability to respond to these\ndisruptions and uncertainties, including adjusting to governmental orders and changes in their customers' shopping habits and behaviors, may impact their ability to survive, and\nultimately, their ability to comply with their lease obligations. Our future results of operations and overall financial performance could be uncertain should a new virus strain of\nCOVID-19, or future pandemics or other health crises occur.\nGeneral Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate\nThe third party valuations of real estate investments we seek to purchase often times includes the value of a commercial lease and the loss of such a lease could result\nin the value of the real property declining.\nMany of the properties that we seek to acquire include a commercial lease arrangement on the property and the corresponding purchase price for such property includes an\nassumption that such lease will continue. If we purchase a property with a commercial lease arrangement that terminates, the value of the investment may decline and we may\nbe unable to sell the property for what we paid.\nOur operating results will be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general, and we cannot assure\nyou that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.\nOur operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:\n•adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions, including the credit markets;\n•changes in governmental laws and regulations, including with respect to taxes, real estate, and the environment, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related\ncosts of compliance with those laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n•takings by condemnation or eminent domain;\n•real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for real estate space in the area;\n•the perceptions of tenants and prospective tenants of the convenience, attractiveness and safety of our properties;\n•competition from comparable properties;\n•the occupancy rate of our properties;\n•the ability to collect all rent from tenants on a timely basis;\n•the effects of any bankruptcies or insolvencies of major tenants;\n•the expense of re-leasing space;\n•changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage funding;\n•the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws;\n•acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist attacks;\n•acts of God, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, health pandemics and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses;\n•cost of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act;\n•changes in general economic or local conditions;\n17\n•changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area;\n•the impact of permanent mortgage funds, which may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive; and\n•periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.\nIf any of these or similar events occur, it may reduce our return from an affected property or investment and reduce or eliminate our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nIf a major tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under its leases, which would have a harmful effect on our financial condition and\nability to pay distributions to you.\nOur success will depend on the financial ability of our tenants to remain current with their leases with us. We may experience concentration in one or more tenants if the future\nleases we have with those tenants represent a significant percentage of our operations. As of March 29, 2024, we have five tenants, that each account for more than 10% of our\nannualized rent: the General Service Administration, Dollar General, the City of San Antonio, exp U. S. Services Inc., Kohl's Corporation who collectively contributed\napproximately 64% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent. Any of our current or future tenants, or any guarantor of one of our current or future tenant’s lease obligations, could\nbe subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States. Such a bankruptcy filing would bar us from attempting to collect pre-\nbankruptcy debts from the bankrupt tenant or its properties unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court. Post-bankruptcy debts would be paid currently. If we\nassume a lease, all pre-bankruptcy balances owing under it must be paid in full. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for\ndamages. This claim could be paid only in the event funds were available, and then only in the same percentage as that realized on other unsecured claims.\nThe bankruptcy of a current or future tenant or lease guarantor could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant lease, and could ultimately preclude full\ncollection of these sums. Such an event also could cause a decrease or cessation of current rental payments, reducing our operating cash flows and the amount available for\ndistributions to you. In the event a current or future tenant or lease guarantor declares bankruptcy, the tenant or its director may not assume our lease or its guaranty. If a given\nlease or guaranty is not assumed, our operating cash flows and the amounts available for distributions to you may be adversely affected. The bankruptcy of a major tenant would\nhave a harmful effect on our ability to pay distributions to you.\nA high concentration of our properties in a particular geographic area, or with tenants in a similar industry, magnify the effects of downturns in that geographic\narea or industry.\nWe plan to focus our acquisition efforts on markets where our tenants or potential tenants can be successful in their current and future operations. As of March 29, 2024, we\nown twenty-six properties, which are located in Alabama (1 property), Arizona (1 property), California (3 properties), Colorado (1 property), Washington, D.C. (1 property),\nFlorida (5 properties), Georgia (1 property), Illinois (2 properties), Maine (2 properties), North Carolina (1 property), Ohio (3 properties), Pennsylvania (1 property), Texas (2\nproperties) and Virginia (2 properties). In the event that we have a concentration of properties in any particular geographic area, any adverse situation that disproportionately\naffects that geographic area, such as a local economic downturn or a severe natural disaster, would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. In addition, we may own\nproperties, either currently or in the future, that subjects us to the risk of rising sea levels, potential flooding, increased frequency or severity of hurricanes or other natural\ndisasters as a result of climate change and global warming, which risk is increased given our geographic concentration. Similarly, if tenants of our properties become\nconcentrated in a certain industry or industries or in any particular tenant, any adverse effect to that industry or tenant generally would have a disproportionately adverse effect\non our portfolio.\nWe own twenty-three of our properties through preferred equity partnerships, which may lead to disagreements with our partners and adversely affect our interest\nin the partnerships.\nAs of March 29, 2024, we own twenty-three properties through preferred equity partnerships and we may enter into more in the future. Our partners, as well as any future\npartners, may have interests that are different from ours which may result in conflicting views as to the conduct of the business of the partnership. In the event that we have a\ndisagreement with a partner as to the resolution of a particular issue to come before the partnership, or as to the management or conduct of the business of the partnership in\ngeneral, we may not be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor and such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in the partnership.\nIn addition, investments made in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements involve risks not otherwise present in investments we make, including the following risks:\n•that our partner in an investment could become insolvent or bankrupt;\n•that our partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become inconsistent with our business interests or goals\n•that the partner could take actions that decrease the value of an investment to us; or\n•that the partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives.\nAny of the risks above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that partner.\n18\nIf a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant’s bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we would purchase a property and then lease the same property back to the person from whom we purchased it. In the\nevent of the bankruptcy of a tenant, a transaction structured as a sale-leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a preferred equity partnership (which is\ngenerally classified as Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest or Non-Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest in our Operating Partnership), either of which outcomes could\nadversely affect our business. If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the\nstatus of a creditor in relation to the tenant. In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property. Instead, we would have a\nclaim against the tenant for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property. The tenant/debtor might have the ability to propose a plan\nrestructuring the term, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance. If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and\nprevented from foreclosing our lien on the property. If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a joint venture, our lessee and we could be treated as co-venturers with regard\nto the property. As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee relating to the property. Either of these outcomes could\nadversely affect our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.\nWe may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property and would have only limited recourse in the event our due diligence did not identify any issues\nthat lower the value of our property.\nThe seller of a property often sells such property in its “as is” condition on a “where is” basis and “with all faults,” without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a\nparticular use or purpose. In addition, purchase agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period\nafter the closing. Thus, the purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all of our invested capital in the property as well as the loss\nof rental income from that property.\nOur real estate investments may include special use single-tenant properties that may be difficult to sell or re-lease upon lease terminations.\nWe have invested and intend to invest primarily in single-tenant, income-producing commercial retail, medical, office and industrial properties, a number of which may include\nspecial use single-tenant properties. If the leases on these properties are terminated or not renewed, we may have difficulty re-leasing or selling these properties to new tenants\ndue to the lack of efficient alternate uses for such properties. Therefore, we may be required to expend substantial funds to renovate and/or adapt any such property for a\nrevenue-generating alternate use or make rent concessions in order to lease the property to another tenant or sell the property. These and other limitations may adversely affect\nthe cash flows from, lead to a decline in value of or eliminate the return on investment of, these special use single-tenant properties.\nWe may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements, build outs or capital needs, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to\nour stockholders.\nWhen tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, it is usual that, in order to attract replacement tenants, we will be required to expend substantial funds for\ntenant improvements, tenant refurbishments or tenant-specific build outs to the vacated space. In addition, although we expect that our leases with tenants will require tenants to\npay routine property maintenance costs, we will likely be responsible for any major structural repairs, such as repairs to the foundation, exterior walls and rooftops. If we need\nadditional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason, we will have to obtain financing from cash flow from operations, borrowings,\nproperty sales or future equity offerings. These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all. If we cannot procure additional funding for capital\nimprovements, our investments may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both.\nOur inability to sell a property when we desire to do so could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to you.\nThe real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates, supply and demand, and other factors that are\nbeyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a\nprospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We may not\nhave adequate funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements. Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that\nproperty for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. We cannot predict the length\nof time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Our inability to sell a property when we desire to do so may cause us to reduce our selling price for\nthe property, and could adversely impact our ability to pay distributions to you. Furthermore, our ability to dispose of certain of our properties is subject to certain limitations\nimposed by our tax protection agreements.\nWe may not be able to sell our properties at a price equal to, or greater than, the price for which we purchased such property, which may lead to a decrease in the\nvalue of our assets.\nSome of our leases may not contain rental increases over time, or the rental increases may be less than the fair market rate at a future point in time. In such event, the value of\nthe leased property to a potential purchaser may not increase over time, which may restrict our ability to sell that property, or if we are able to sell that property, may result in a\nsale price less than the price that we paid to purchase the property.\n19\nWe may acquire or finance properties with lock-out provisions, which may prohibit us from selling a property, or may require us to maintain specified debt levels\nfor a period of years on some properties.\nLock-out provisions could materially restrict us from selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing properties. These provisions would affect our ability to turn our\ninvestments into cash and thus affect cash available for distributions to you. Lock-out provisions may prohibit us from reducing the outstanding indebtedness with respect to any\nproperties, refinancing such indebtedness on a non-recourse basis at maturity, or increasing the amount of indebtedness with respect to such properties. Lock-out provisions\ncould impair our ability to take other actions during the lock-out period that could be in the best interests of our stockholders and, therefore, may have an adverse impact on the\nvalue of the shares, relative to the value that would result if the lock-out provisions did not exist. In particular, lock-out provisions could preclude us from participating in major\ntransactions that could result in a disposition of our assets or a change in control even though that disposition or change in control might be in the best interests of our\nstockholders.\nRising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions.\nOur properties are subject to operating risks common to real estate in general, any or all of which may negatively affect us. If any property is not fully occupied or if rents are\nbeing paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses, we could be required to expend funds with respect to that property for operating expenses. The\nproperties will be subject to increases in tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses. While we expect that\nmany of our properties will be leased on a net-lease basis or will require the tenants to pay all or a portion of such expenses, renewals of leases or future leases may not be\nnegotiated on that basis, in which event we may have to pay those costs. If we are unable to lease properties on a net-lease basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or\nsome of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs which could adversely affect funds available\nfor future acquisitions or cash available for distributions.\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively affect our returns and profitability.\nOur operating results may be affected by the following market and economic challenges, which may result from a continued or exacerbated general economic slowdown\nexperienced by the nation as a whole or by the local economics where our properties are located:\n•poor economic conditions may result in tenant defaults under leases;\n•re-leasing may require concessions or reduced rental rates under the new leases; and\n•increased insurance premiums may reduce funds available for distribution or, to the extent such increases are passed through to tenants, may lead to tenant defaults.\nIncreased insurance premiums may make it difficult to increase rents to tenants on turnover, which may adversely affect our ability to increase our returns.\nThe length and severity of any economic downturn cannot be predicted. Recently, the economic climate was negatively impacted by the actions taken by governmental\nauthorities, businesses and individuals in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Our tenants, and therefore, operations will be negatively affected in the event of a prolonged\neconomic downturn.\nIncreased vacancy rates could have an adverse impact on our ability to make distributions and the value of an investment in our shares.\nIf we experience vacancy rates that are higher than historical vacancy rates, we may have to offer lower rental rates and greater tenant improvements or concessions than\nexpected. Increased vacancies may have a greater impact on us, as compared to real estate investment programs with other investment strategies, as our investment approach\nrelies on long-term leases in order to provide a relatively stable stream of income for our business. As a result, increased vacancy rates could have the following negative effects\non us:\n•the values of our potential investments in commercial properties could decrease below the amount paid for such investments;\n•revenues from such properties could decrease due to low or no rental income during vacant periods, lower future rental rates and/or increased tenant improvement\nexpenses or concessions; and/or\n•revenues from such properties that secure loans could decrease, making it more difficult for us to meet our payment obligations.\nAll of these factors could impair our ability to make distributions and decrease the value of an investment in our shares.\nGlobal market and economic conditions, including as a result of health crises may materially and adversely affect us and our tenants.\nIf the U.S. economy were to continue to experience adverse economic conditions as a result of the coronavirus or otherwise, such as high unemployment levels, such conditions\nmay have an impact on the results of operations and financial conditions of our tenants. During periods of economic slowdown, rising interest rates and declining demand for\nreal estate may result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of lease defaults. Volatility in the United States and global markets can make it difficult to determine\nthe breadth and duration of the impact of future economic and financial market crises and the ways in which our tenants and our business may be affected. A lack of demand for\nrental space could adversely affect our ability to gain new tenants, which may affect our growth and profitability. Accordingly, the adverse economic conditions could\nmaterially and adversely affect us.\nWe may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic changes in the specific geographic areas where our investments are concentrated.\nAdverse conditions (including business layoffs or downsizing, the impact of disruptions in global trade agreements or the imposition of tariffs, industry slowdowns, changing\ndemographics, protests, riots and other factors) in the areas where our investments are located and/or\n20\nconcentrated, and local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of, or reduced demand for, office, industrial, retail or multifamily properties) may have an adverse effect on\nthe value of our investments. A material decline in the demand or the ability of tenants to pay rent for office, industrial or retail space in these geographic areas may result in a\nmaterial decline in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe may recognize substantial impairment charges on our properties.\nWe may in the future incur substantial impairment charges, which we are required to recognize whenever we sell a property for less than its carrying value or we determine that\nthe carrying amount of the property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value (or, for direct financing leases, that the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying property\nhas declined). By their nature, the timing or extent of impairment charges are not predictable. We may incur non-cash impairment charges in the future, which may reduce our\nnet income.\nIf we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.\nGenerally, each of our tenants will be responsible for insuring its goods and premises and, in some circumstances, may be required to reimburse us for a share of the cost of\nacquiring comprehensive insurance for the property, including casualty, liability, fire and extended coverage customarily obtained for similar properties in amounts that we\ndetermine are sufficient to cover reasonably foreseeable losses. Tenants of single-tenant properties leased on a net-lease basis typically are required to pay all insurance costs\nassociated with those properties. Material losses may occur in excess of insurance proceeds with respect to any property, as insurance may not be sufficient to fund the losses.\nHowever, there are types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental\nmatters, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks\nassociated with potential terrorism acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Additionally, mortgage lenders in some\ncases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase specific coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans. It is uncertain whether\nsuch insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our potential properties. In these instances, we\nmay be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We may not have adequate, or any, coverage\nfor such losses.\nReal estate related taxes may increase and if these increases are not passed on to tenants, our income will be reduced.\nSome local real property tax assessors may seek to reassess some of our properties as a result of our acquisition of the property. Generally, from time to time, our property taxes\nmay increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors. An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real\nestate tax purposes will result in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property. Although most of our tenant leases permit us to pass through such tax increases to\nthe tenants for payment, there is no assurance that renewal leases or future leases will be negotiated on the same basis. Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely\naffect our income, cash available for distributions, and the amount of distributions to you.\nWe could be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to investments to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, and taking title to properties, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to such properties. Federal, state and local laws impose\nliability on a landowner for releases or the otherwise improper presence on the premises of hazardous substances. In such a circumstance, we may be held liable to a\ngovernmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and cleanup costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental\ncontamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or\nremediation activities could be substantial. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nProperties may contain mold or asbestos or other hazardous conditions.\nUnder various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of\nremoval or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property, such as mold, asbestos or other conditions. Mold contamination has been linked to a\nnumber of health problems, resulting in recent litigation by tenants seeking various remedies, including damages and ability to terminate their leases. Originally occurring in\nresidential property, mold claims have recently begun to appear in commercial properties as well. Several insurance companies have reported a substantial increase in mold-\nrelated claims, causing a growing concern that real estate owners might be subject to increasing lawsuits regarding mold contamination. No assurance can be given that a mold\ncondition will not exist at one or more of our properties, with the risk of substantial damages, legal fees and possibly loss of tenants. It is unclear whether such mold claims\nwould be covered by the customary insurance policies we obtain.\nCC&Rs may restrict our ability to operate a property.\nSome of our properties are contiguous to other parcels of real property, comprising part of the same commercial center. In connection with such properties, there are significant\ncovenants, conditions and restrictions (“CC&Rs”) restricting the operation of such properties and any improvements on such properties, and related to granting easements on\nsuch properties. Moreover, the operation and management of the contiguous properties may impact such properties. Compliance with CC&Rs may adversely affect our\noperating costs and reduce the amount of funds that we have available to pay distributions.\n21\nOur operating results may be negatively affected by potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks.\nWe may acquire and develop properties upon which we will construct improvements. We will be subject to uncertainties associated with re-zoning for development,\nenvironmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups, and our builder’s ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs, and\ntimetables. If a builder fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance. A builder’s performance\nmay also be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder’s control. Delays in completion of construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction\nleases. We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction. These and other such factors\ncan result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment. In addition, we will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects. We also must\nrely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a price at the time we\nacquire the property. If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and our return on our investment could suffer.\nWe may invest in unimproved real property. Returns from development of unimproved properties are also subject to risks associated with re-zoning the land for development\nand environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. Although we intend to limit any investment in unimproved property to property we intend to\ndevelop, your investment nevertheless is subject to the risks associated with investments in unimproved real property.\nCompetition with third parties in acquiring properties and other investments may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.\nWe compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, bank and insurance company investment accounts, REITs,\nreal estate limited partnerships, and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, many of which have greater resources than we do. Larger competitors may enjoy\nsignificant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. In addition, the number of entities and the\namount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase. Any such increase would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore possibly increased prices\npaid for them. If we pay higher prices for properties and other investments, our profitability may be reduced and you may experience a lower return on your investment.\nOur properties may face competition that could reduce the amount of rent paid to us, which would reduce the cash available for distributions and the amount of\ndistributions.\nWe expect that our properties will typically be located in developed areas. Therefore, there are and will be numerous other properties within the market area of each of our\nproperties that will compete with us for tenants. The number of competitive properties could have a material effect on our ability to rent space at our properties and the amount\nof rents charged. We could be adversely affected if additional competitive properties are built in locations competitive with our properties, causing increased competition for\ncustomer traffic and creditworthy tenants. This could result in decreased cash flow from tenants and may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would\nnot have otherwise made, thus affecting cash available for distributions, and the amount available for distributions to you.\nCosts of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash\navailable for any distributions.\nAll real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health\nand safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the\nuse, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. Environmental laws and\nregulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether\nthe acts causing the contamination were legal. This liability could be substantial. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these\nsubstances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.\nSome of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates. Compliance with new or more\nstringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us. Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material\nenvironmental liability. Additionally, several conditions, such as our tenants’ operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our\nproperties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties, may affect our properties. In addition, there are various local, state and\nfederal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for\nnoncompliance. Any material expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions and may reduce the value of your investment.\nState and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving, and we intend to monitor these laws and take commercially reasonable steps to protect ourselves from the impact of\nthese laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of most properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment\nfor every property we acquire. In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or that a prior owner of a property did not create a\nmaterial environmental condition not known to us. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating\nany contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims would materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts\navailable for distribution to you.\n22\nInflation and changes in interest rates may materially and adversely affect us and our tenants.\nWe are currently experiencing high rates of inflation and increasing interest rates in the United States. A continued rise in inflation or interest rates may result in rates greater\nthan the increases in rent that we anticipate may be provided by many of our leases. Increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating\nexpenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent owed to us.\nIn addition, while the Company does not have any variable rate debt, to the extent that we incur variable rate debt in the future, increases in interest rates would increase our\ninterest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions to you. Furthermore, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates,\nwe could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.\nOur costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.\nOur properties will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “Disabilities Act”). Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are\nrequired to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for “public\naccommodations” and “commercial facilities” that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to\npeople with disabilities. The Disabilities Act’s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties,\nor, in some cases, an award of damages. We will attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Disabilities Act or place the burden on the seller or other third party, such as\na tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner. If\nwe cannot, our funds used for Disabilities Act compliance will reduce the cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions to you.\nWe may not be able to re-lease or renew leases at our properties on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe are subject to risks that upon expiration or earlier termination of the leases for space at our properties, the space may not be released or, if re-leased, the terms of the renewal\nor re-leasing (including the costs of required renovations or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Any of these situations may result in\nextended periods where there is a significant decline in revenues or no revenues generated by an investment. If we are unable to re-lease or renew leases for all or substantially\nall of the spaces at these investments, if the rental rates upon such renewal or re-leasing are significantly lower than expected, if our reserves for these purposes prove\ninadequate, or if we are required to make significant renovations or concessions to tenants as part of the renewal or re-leasing process, we will experience a reduction in net\nincome and may be required to reduce or eliminate distributions to our stockholders.\nLease defaults, terminations or landlord-tenant disputes may adversely reduce our income from our property portfolio.\nLease defaults or terminations by one or more of our significant tenants may reduce our revenues unless a default is cured or a suitable replacement tenant is found promptly. In\naddition, disputes may arise between us and a tenant that result in the tenant withholding rent payments, possibly for an extended period. These disputes may lead to litigation\nor other legal procedures to secure payment of the rent withheld or to evict the tenant. In other circumstances, a tenant may have a contractual right to abate or suspend rent\npayments. Even without such right, a tenant might determine to do so. Any of these situations may result in extended periods during which there is a significant decline in\nrevenues or no revenues generated by the property. If this were to occur, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNet leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time, which could negatively impact our income and reduce the amount of funds available to make\ndistributions to our stockholders.\nA significant portion of our rental income is derived from net leases, which generally provide the tenant greater discretion in using the leased property than ordinary property\nleases, such as the right to freely sublease the property, to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances.\nFurthermore, net leases typically have longer lease terms and, thus, there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market\nrental rates during those years. As a result, our income and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not engage in net leases.\nYour investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (and similar\nlegislation in other jurisdictions).\nNeither we nor any of our subsidiaries intend to register as investment companies under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder (and\nsimilar legislation in other jurisdictions) (the “Investment Company Act”). If we or our subsidiaries were obligated to register as investment companies, we would have to\ncomply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that impose, among other things:\n•limitations on capital structure;\n•restrictions on specified investments;\n•prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and\n•compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase our operating expenses.\n•Under the relevant provisions of Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, an investment company is any issuer that:\n23\n•is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities (the “primarily engaged\ntest”); or\n•is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment\nsecurities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis\n(the “40% test”). “Investment securities” excludes U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies\nand are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) (relating to private investment companies).\nWe believe that neither we nor our Operating Partnership will be required to register as an investment company. With respect to the 40% test, the entities through which we and\nour Operating Partnership intend to own our assets will be majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exceptions\nfrom the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7).\nWith respect to the primarily engaged test, we and our Operating Partnership are holding companies and do not intend to invest or trade in securities ourselves. Rather, through\nthe majority-owned subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, we and our Operating Partnership are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these\nsubsidiaries, namely the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real estate and real estate-related assets.\nTo maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act, our subsidiaries may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want them to sell and may need to sell assets we\nwould otherwise wish them to retain. In addition, our subsidiaries may have to acquire additional assets that they might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo\nopportunities to make investments that we would otherwise want them to make and would be important to our investment strategy. Moreover, the SEC or its staff may issue\ninterpretations with respect to various types of assets that are contrary to our views and current SEC staff interpretations are subject to change, which increases the risk of non-\ncompliance and the risk that we may be forced to make adverse changes to our portfolio. If we were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, we would\nbe prohibited from engaging in our business and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court\nrequired enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.\nRisks Associated with Debt Financing\nWe have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness,\nwhich increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.\nWe are permitted to acquire real properties and other real estate-related investments, including entity acquisitions, by assuming either existing financing secured by the asset or\nby borrowing new funds. In addition, we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of our assets to obtain funds to acquire additional\ninvestments or to pay distributions to our stockholders. We also may borrow funds, if necessary, to satisfy the requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual “REIT\ntaxable income,” or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to assure that we continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes at such time as our Board of Directors\ndetermines is in our best interest.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total cash (unrestricted and restricted) of $3,151,946, properties with a cost basis of $104,912,421 and outstanding debt of $56,817,310.\nThere is no limit on the amount we may invest in any single property or other asset or on the amount we can borrow to purchase any individual property or other investment. If\nwe mortgage a property and have insufficient cash flow to service the debt, we risk an event of default which may result in our lenders foreclosing on the properties securing the\nmortgage.\nIf we cannot repay or refinance loans incurred to purchase our properties, or interests therein, then we may lose our interests in the properties secured by the loans we are unable\nto repay or refinance.\nWe utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, leverage, which may limit our financial flexibility in the future.\nAccording to NAREIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, REITs have largely been resilient during the pandemic as overall leverage ratios were at or\nnear the lowest on record. According to NAREIT, REITs also lengthened the maturities of their debts to reduce risks of having to refinance during adverse market conditions\nand maintained high levels of liquidity, both on balance sheet through holdings of cash and securities and also through committed lines of credit.\nOur ability to execute our business strategies, and in particular to make new investments, is highly dependent upon our ability to procure external financing. Our principal\nsources of external financing include the issuance of our equity securities and mortgages secured by properties. We continue to obtain mortgages from the commercial\nmortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) market, life insurance companies and regional banks. However, with rising interest rates, lenders are currently concerned about the\noutlook of the credit markets, market volatility, and the potential impact of new regulations. Even though we have been successful in procuring equity financing and secured\nmortgages financing, we cannot be assured that we will be successful at doing so in the future.\n24\nHigh levels of debt or increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our loan payments, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to\nstockholders.\nHigh debt levels will cause us to incur higher interest charges, resulting in higher debt service payments, and may be accompanied by restrictive covenants. Interest we pay\nreduces cash available for distribution to stockholders. Additionally, we currently do not have any variable rate debt but if we do in the future then increases in interest rates\nincrease our interest costs, which reduces our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to you. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising\ninterest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum return on such\ninvestments and could result in a loss. In addition, if we are unable to service our debt payments, our lenders may foreclose on our interests in the real property that secures the\nloans we have entered into.\nHigh mortgage rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire, our cash flow from\noperations and the amount of cash distributions we can make.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we will be required to distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders in each taxable year, and thus\nour ability to retain internally generated cash is limited. Accordingly, our ability to acquire properties or to make capital improvements to or remodel properties will depend on\nour ability to obtain debt or equity financing from third parties or the sellers of properties. If mortgage debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to finance the\npurchase of properties. If we place mortgage debt on properties, we run the risk of being unable to refinance the properties when the debt becomes due or of being unable to\nrefinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance the properties, our income could be reduced. We may be unable to refinance properties. If any of\nthese events occurs, our cash flow would be reduced. This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to you and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing\nmore stock or borrowing more money.\nLenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to you.\nWe make acquisitions and operate our business in part through the utilization of leverage pursuant to loan agreements with various financial institutions. These loan agreements\ncontain standard affirmative and negative covenants, including prohibitions on additional liens on the collateral, financial reporting obligations and maintenance of insurance, in\naddition to Debt Service Coverage Ratios (\"DSCR\") covenants. Loan documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property,\ndiscontinue insurance coverage, or replace our property manager. These covenants, as well as any future covenants we may enter into through further loan agreements, could\nlimit our operational flexibility and/or could inhibit our financial flexibility in the future and prevent distributions to stockholders. As of December 31, 2023, we were in\ncompliance with all covenants with the exception of one project level debt service coverage ratio (\"DSCR\") covenant for 2510 Walmer Ave. Our Bayport Credit Union loan\ncovenant requires project level, property level and portfolio level DSCR minimum testing. At the project-level, 2510 Walmer Ave tested at a 1.17:1 DSCR, compared with the\n1.25:1 project level minimum DSCR, driven by its vacancy since January 2023. According to the governing loan documents, failing to meet DSCR coverage requirements is a\ntechnical default triggering the risk of forfeiture of the property, accelerating the repayment of the remaining outstanding balance of the loan at the lender's discretion. All other\nDSCR covenants tested compliant and the lender has indicated no intention of action. Additionally, a new lease was executed for 2510 Walmer Ave. on March 28, 2024 and will\nrestore the property to full occupancy upon commencement.\nSome of our mortgage loans may have “due on sale” provisions, which may impact the manner in which we acquire, sell and/or finance our properties.\nIn purchasing properties subject to financing, we may obtain financing with “due-on-sale” and/or “due-on-encumbrance” clauses. Due-on sale clauses in mortgages allow a\nmortgage lender to demand full repayment of the mortgage loan if the borrower sells the mortgaged property. Similarly, due-on-encumbrance clauses allow a mortgage lender to\ndemand full repayment if the borrower uses the real estate securing the mortgage loan as security for another loan. In such event, we may be required to sell our properties on an\nall-cash basis, which may make it more difficult to sell the property or reduce the selling price.\nLenders may be able to recover against our other properties under our mortgage loans.\nIn financing our acquisitions, we will seek to obtain secured nonrecourse loans. However, only recourse financing may be available, in which event, in addition to the property\nsecuring the loan, the lender would have the ability to look to our other assets for satisfaction of the debt if the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the property\nsecuring the loan are insufficient to fully repay it. Also, in order to facilitate the sale of a property, we may allow the buyer to purchase the property subject to an existing loan\nwhereby we remain responsible for the debt.\nIf we are required to make payments under any “bad boy” carve-out guaranties that we may provide in connection with certain mortgages and related loans, our\nbusiness and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn obtaining certain nonrecourse loans, we may provide standard carve-out guaranties. These guaranties are only applicable if and when the borrower directly, or indirectly\nthrough agreement with an affiliate, joint venture partner or other third party, voluntarily files a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action or takes other actions\nthat are fraudulent or improper (commonly referred to as “bad boy” guaranties). Although we believe that “bad boy” carve-out guaranties are not guaranties of payment in the\nevent of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond the borrower’s control, some lenders in the real estate industry have recently sought to make\nclaims for payment under such guaranties. In the event such a claim were made against us under a “bad boy” carve-out guaranty following foreclosure on mortgages or related\nloan, and such claim were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. In accordance with our President and CEO's employment\nagreement, we are also required to pay a guaranty fee payable\n25\nto him for his personal guaranty and such payment will reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders because cash otherwise available for distribution will be\nrequired to pay principal and interest associated with these mortgage loans.\nInterest-only indebtedness may increase our risk of default and ultimately may reduce our funds available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe may finance our property acquisitions using interest-only mortgage indebtedness. During the interest-only period, the amount of each scheduled payment will be less than\nthat of a traditional amortizing mortgage loan. The principal balance of the mortgage loan will not be reduced (except in the case of prepayments) because there are no scheduled\nmonthly payments of principal during this period. After the interest-only period, we will be required either to make scheduled payments of amortized principal and interest or to\nmake a lump-sum or “balloon” payment at maturity. These required principal or balloon payments will increase the amount of our scheduled payments and may increase our\nrisk of default under the related mortgage loan. If the mortgage loan has an adjustable interest rate, the amount of our scheduled payments also may increase at a time of rising\ninterest rates. Increased payments and substantial principal or balloon maturity payments will reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders because cash\notherwise available for distribution will be required to pay principal and interest associated with these mortgage loans.\nWe may enter into derivative or hedging contracts that could expose us to contingent liabilities and certain risks and costs in the future.\nPart of our investment strategy may involve entering into derivative or hedging contracts that could require us to fund cash payments in the future under certain circumstances,\nsuch as the early termination of the derivative agreement caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin\nsecurities it is contractually owed under the terms of the derivative contract. The amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective\ncounterparty and could also include other fees and charges. These economic losses would be reflected in our financial results of operations, and our ability to fund these\nobligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nFurther, the cost of using derivative or hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates.\nWe may increase our derivative or hedging activity and thus increase our related costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising and hedging costs have increased.\nIn addition, hedging instruments involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S.\nor foreign governmental authorities. Consequently, in many cases, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer\nfunds and positions. Furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and\nother regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with\nwhom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of\nunrealized profits and force us to cover our resale commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our\nhedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter\ninto an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. We cannot be assured that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be\nrequired to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge risk effectively.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code may limit the ability of a REIT to hedge the risks inherent to its operations. From time to time, we may enter into hedging transactions with\nrespect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Our hedging transactions may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps and floors, options to purchase these items, and\nfutures and forward contracts. Any income or gain derived by us from transactions that hedge certain risks, such as the risk of changes in interest rates, will not be treated as\ngross income for purposes of either the 75% or the 95% income test for the purposes of qualifying as a REIT unless specific requirements are met. Such requirements include\nthat the hedging transaction be properly identified within prescribed time periods and that the transaction either (1) hedges risks associated with indebtedness issued by us that is\nincurred to acquire or carry real estate assets or (2) manages the risks of currency fluctuations with respect to income or gain that qualifies under the 75% or 95% income test (or\nassets that generate such income). To the extent that we do not properly identify such transactions as hedges, hedge with other types of financial instruments, or hedge other\ntypes of indebtedness, the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 75%- and 95%-income tests. As a result of these\nrules, we may have to limit the use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous, which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes\nthan we would otherwise incur.\nInterest rates may continue to increase.\nCurrent economic conditions are signaling that interest rates are likely to continue to rise throughout 2023 and potentially beyond in response to an inflationary environment. If\nthere is a continued increase in interest rates, any debt servicing on investments could be significantly higher than currently anticipated, which would reduce the amount of cash\navailable for distribution to the stockholders. Also, rising interest rates may affect the ability of our management to refinance an investment. Investments may be less desirable\nto prospective purchasers in a rising interest rate environment and their values may be adversely impacted by the reduction in cash flow due to increased interest payments.\n26\nWe may use floating rate, interest-only or short-term loans to acquire assets.\nOur management has the right, in its sole discretion, to negotiate any debt financing, including obtaining (i) interest-only, (ii) floating rate and/or (iii) short-term loans to acquire\nassets. If our management obtains floating rate loans, the interest rate would not be fixed but would float with an established index (probably at higher interest rates in the\nfuture). No principal would be repaid on interest-only loans. Finally, we would be required to refinance short-term loans at the end of a relatively short period. No assurance\ncan be given that our management would be able to refinance with fixed-rate permanent loans in the future, on favorable terms or at all, to refinance the short-term loans. In\naddition, no assurance can be given that the terms of such future loans to refinance the short-term loans would be favorable to us.\nWe may use leverage to make investments.\nOur management, in its sole discretion, may leverage our assets. As a result of the use of leverage, a decrease in revenues of a leveraged asset may materially and adversely\naffect that investment’s cash flow and, in turn, our ability to make distributions. No assurance can be given that future cash flow of a particular asset will be sufficient to make\nthe debt service payments on any borrowed funds for that asset and also cover operating expenses. If the investment’s revenues are insufficient to pay debt service and operating\nexpenses, we would be required to use net income from other assets, working capital or reserves, or seek additional funds. There can be no assurance that additional funds will\nbe available, if needed, or, if such funds are available, that they will be available on terms acceptable to us.\nLeveraging an asset allows a lender to foreclose on that asset.\nLenders financing an asset, even non-recourse lenders, are expected in all instances to retain the right to foreclose on that asset if there is a default in the loan terms. If this were\nto occur, we would likely lose our entire investment in that asset. Lenders may have approval rights with respect to an encumbered asset. A lender financing an asset will likely\nhave numerous other rights, which may include the right to approve any change in the property manager for a particular investment.\nAvailability of financing and market conditions will affect the success of the Company.\nMarket fluctuations in real estate financing may affect the availability and cost of funds needed in the future for investments. In addition, credit availability has been restricted\nin the past and may become restricted again in the future. Restrictions upon the availability of real estate financing or high interest rates for real estate loans could adversely\naffect the investments and our ability to execute its investment goals.\nWe continue to have significant debt obligations and our independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern”.\nWe have significant debt obligations under our Bayport Credit Union commercial loan agreements, with $7.3 million and $4.6 million of secured nonrecourse principal due in\nSeptember 2024 and October 2024, respectively.\nWe cannot reasonably guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to\nfund our future liquidity needs and to make the required payment on the indebtedness. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and/or other available capital resources\nwe could face substantial liquidity constraints. To the extent that we could not repay or refinance our indebtedness when due, or generate adequate cash flows from operations,\nwe may have to curtail operations which would adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot reasonably guarantee that we will be able to raise\nsufficient capital through debt or equity financings on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that we could consummate dispositions of assets or operations for fair market value, in\na timely manner or at all.\nFederal Income Tax Risks\nThe Company's failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. Our ongoing qualification as a REIT will\ndepend upon our ability to meet, through investments, actual operating results, distributions and satisfaction of specific rules, the various tests imposed by the Code. We believe\nthat we have structured our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all of these requirements. However, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the Internal\nRevenue Service (the “IRS”), such recharacterization could jeopardize our ability to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT. We will not apply for a ruling\nfrom the IRS regarding our status as a REIT. Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could\nprevent our qualification or result in our disqualification as a REIT.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year after having qualified we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. Also, we would\ngenerally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT status. Losing our REIT status would reduce our net\nearnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the\ndividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order\nto pay the applicable tax. Moreover, if any of our initial properties acquired before we qualified as a REIT were to be sold within five years after electing REIT status, the\ndisposition could give rise to gain that would be subject to corporate income tax. To qualify as a REIT, we may not have, at the end of any taxable year, any undistributed\nearnings and profits that are attributable to a “C” corporation taxable year. We do not believe we will have any undistributed “C” corporation earnings and profits, but in the\nevent we do accumulate any non-REIT\n27\nearnings and profits, we intend to distribute such non-REIT earnings and profits before the end of our first REIT taxable year to comply with this requirement. There can be no\nassurance that the IRS would not take the position that the distribution procedure is not available, in which case we would fail to qualify as a REIT.\nWe may have difficulty satisfying the requirement that we not be closely held.\nOne of the requirements for REIT qualification is that we not be closely held. For these purposes, we will be closely held if five or fewer individuals (including certain entities\ntreated as individuals for this purpose) own (or are treated as owning under applicable attribution rules) more than 50% by value of our stock at any time during the second half\nof the taxable year. This requirement does not apply during our first REIT year. Upon the election to be taxed as a REIT for our taxable year ending December 31, 2021, the\nclosely held test became effective for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 and we were not considered closely held. As of December 31, 2023 we maintain that we are\nnot closely held. Our articles of incorporation generally restrict any person from owning or being treated as owning more than 9.8% of our stock, limiting the amount of our\nstock any five persons could own or be treated as owning 49% of our stock, in order to prevent us from failing the closely held requirement. As permitted in our articles of\nincorporation, however, our Board has granted, and may grant from time to time in the future, waivers with respect to the 9.8% ownership restriction for holders for which we\ndetermine, based on such holders’ representations, covenants and agreements, that such waivers would not jeopardize our status as a REIT.\nRe-characterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.\nWe may purchase properties and lease them back to the sellers of such properties. While we will use our best efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction so that the\nlease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for federal income tax purposes, the IRS could challenge such\ncharacterization. In the event that any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and re-characterized as a financing transaction or loan for federal income tax purposes,\ndeductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed. If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the\nREIT qualification “asset tests” or the “income tests” and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization. Alternatively, the amount of our\nREIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.\nIn certain circumstances, we may be subject to federal and state income taxes as a REIT, which would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.\nEven if we maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to federal income taxes or state taxes. For example, net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer”\nproperties sold by a REIT (a “prohibited transaction” under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax. We may not be able to make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes\napplicable to REITs. We may also decide to retain capital gains we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on such gain. In that\nevent, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. We may also be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property,\neither directly or at the level of the Operating Partnership or at the level of the other entities through which we indirectly own our assets. Any federal or state taxes we pay will\nreduce our cash available for distribution to you.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn order to maintain our REIT status and to meet the REIT distribution requirements, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis or sell assets, even if the then-\nprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings or sales. To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net\ntaxable income each year, excluding capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income\nincluding any net capital gain. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code for REITs and to minimize or eliminate our\ncorporate income tax obligation to the extent consistent with our business objectives. Our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a\nresult of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital\nexpenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. The insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have\nan adverse impact on our ability to maintain our REIT status. We may have to incur short- or long-term debt or liquidate an investment in a property we were not planning to\nsell to pay these distributions. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are\nless than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.\nFurther, amounts distributed will not be available to fund investment activities. We expect to fund our investments by raising equity capital and through borrowings from\nfinancial institutions and the debt capital markets. If we fail to obtain debt or equity capital in the future, it could limit our ability to grow, which could have a material adverse\neffect on the value of our common stock.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum tax rate applicable to “qualified dividend income” payable to U.S. stockholders that are taxed at individual rates is 20% (exclusive of the application of the 3.8%\nnet investment tax). Dividends (other than capital gain dividends) payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates on qualified dividend income and\ntherefore may be subject to a 37% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on ordinary income when paid to such stockholders. Through taxable years ending December 31,\n2025, the top effective rate applicable to ordinary dividends from REITs is 29.6% (through a 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends received that are not “capital gain\ndividends” or “qualified dividend income,” subject to complex limitations). The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors\nwho are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less\n28\nattractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common\nstock if we qualify as a REIT.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations, operating cash flow or portfolio income to pay our operating expenses, and our operating expenses\ncould rise, diminishing our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\nIf we are established as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and\nnot including net capital gains, each year to our stockholders. To qualify for the tax benefits applicable to REITs, we have and intend to continue to make distributions to our\nstockholders in amounts such that we distribute all or substantially all our net taxable income each year, subject to certain adjustments. However, our ability to make\ndistributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described herein. Our ability to make and sustain cash distributions is based on many factors, including the return on\nour investments, the size of our investment portfolio, operating expense levels, and certain restrictions imposed by Maryland law. Some of the factors are beyond our control\nand a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay future dividends. No assurance can be given as to our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. In the event\nof a downturn in our operating results and financial performance or unanticipated declines in the value of our asset portfolio, we may be unable to declare or pay monthly\ndistributions or make distributions to our stockholders. The timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our Board, which considers, among other factors, our\nearnings, financial condition, debt service obligations and applicable debt covenants, REIT qualification requirements and other tax considerations and capital expenditure\nrequirements as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nOur tax protection agreements could give rise to material liability.\nWe have entered into a tax protection agreement with each of the former Greenwal and Riverside Crossing LLCs, in connection with their respective contributions of property to\nus in June 2019. These agreements limit our ability to dispose of any interest in those contributed properties in a taxable transaction prior to the seventh anniversary of the\napplicable contribution date. Upon such a disposition, subject to certain exceptions (such as a tax-deferred Section 1031 like-kind exchange), we are required to indemnify\nGreenwal and Riverside Crossing LLCs. and their indirect owners for their federal, state and local income tax liabilities attributable to the built-in gain that existed with respect\nto such contributed property as of the contribution date, plus in certain instances, an additional amount so that after the counterparty (or certain other parties) has paid any\nfederal, state and local income taxes on the tax indemnity payments received, including any additional amounts, it has received an amount equal to the additional federal, state\nand local income taxes incurred. Moreover, the agreements require a similar indemnification obligation if, during the seven-year period from the applicable contribution date,\nwe do not maintain a certain minimum level of nonrecourse debt secured by the contributed property or fail to offer the contributors the opportunity to guarantee any\nreplacement debt upon a future repayment, retirement, refinancing or other reduction (other than a scheduled amortization) of currently outstanding debt on their respective\ncontributed property. We agreed to these provisions to facilitate the property acquisitions and assist the contributors in deferring the recognition of taxable gain as a result of\ntheir contribution of the properties to us. At the time of contribution, the approximate appraised value of the property contributed by Greenwal was $11.8 million, and the\napproximate value of the property contributed by Riverside Crossing was $7.1 million.\nLegislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors.\nBecause our operations are governed to a significant extent by the federal tax laws, new legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors.\nYou are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on\nan investment in our common stock. You should also note that our counsel’s tax opinion assumes that no legislation will be enacted after the date of this Form 10-K that will be\napplicable to an investment in our shares, and that future legislation may affect this tax opinion.\nForeign purchasers of our common stock may be subject to FIRPTA tax upon the sale of their shares.\nForeign persons (other than certain foreign pension funds) disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of\nU.S. real property interests, are generally subject to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax of 1980, as amended, known as FIRPTA, on the gain recognized on the\ndisposition. Such FIRPTA tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is “domestically controlled.” A REIT is “domestically controlled” if\nless than 50% of the REIT’s stock, by value, has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying U.S. persons during a continuous five-year period ending\non the date of disposition or, if shorter, during the entire period of the REIT’s existence. We cannot assure you that we will qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. If we\nwere to fail to so qualify, gain realized by foreign investors on a sale of our shares would be subject to FIRPTA tax, unless our shares were regularly traded on an established\nsecurities market and the foreign investor did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of the value of our outstanding common\nstock.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or\nabove the price at which you purchased your shares.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the\nmarket price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased your shares. We cannot assure\nyou that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate\n29\nor decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock\ninclude:\n•actual or anticipated variations in our operating results, funds from operations, cash flows, liquidity or distributions;\n•changes in our earnings estimates or those of analysts;\n•publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry or sector in which we operate;\n•increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher dividend yield;\n•changes in market valuations of companies similar to us;\n•adverse market reaction to any securities we may issue or additional debt we incur in the future;\n•adverse impacts of the coronavirus on our tenants or the economy in general;\n•additions or departures of key management personnel;\n•actions by institutional stockholders;\n•speculation in the press or investment community;\n•high levels of volatility in the credit markets;\n•the realization of any of the other risk factors included herein; and\n•general market and economic conditions.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. Accordingly, we may be the target\nof securities related litigation or other similar litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and\nresources, which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any adverse determination in litigation could also\nsubject us to significant liabilities.\nWe can provide no assurance that our common stock and warrants will continue to meet Nasdaq listing requirements. If we fail to comply with the continuing listing\nstandards of Nasdaq, our securities could be delisted.\nOur shares of common stock and warrants are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\"Nasdaq\"). For our securities to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq, we must meet\nthe current Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we were unable to meet these requirements, our securities could be delisted from the Nasdaq. Any such delisting of our\nsecurities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares and warrants\nthat can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we\nwere to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nBecause we have 110 million authorized shares of stock, management could issue additional shares, diluting the current shareholders’ equity.\nWe have 100 million authorized shares of common stock and 10 million authorized shares of preferred stock. Our management could, without the consent of the existing\nshareholders, issue substantially more shares of common stock, causing a large dilution in the equity position of our current shareholders. Additionally, large share issuances\nwould generally have a negative impact on the value of our shares, which could cause you to lose a substantial amount, or all, of your investment.\nHolders of the warrants have no rights as a common stockholder until they acquire our common stock.\nUntil holders of our warrants acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants, the holders will, with certain limited exceptions, have no rights with respect to\nshares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. Upon exercise of the warrants, the holder will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder as\nto the security exercised only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise.\nThe exclusive forum clause set forth in the warrants may have the effect of limiting an investor’s rights to bring legal action against us and could limit the investor’s\nability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur outstanding warrants provide for investors to consent to exclusive forum to state or federal courts located in New York, New York. This exclusive forum may have the\neffect of limiting the ability of investors to bring a legal claim against us due to geographic limitations and may limit an investor’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum\nthat it finds favorable for disputes with us. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the\nspecified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our\n30\nbusiness and financial condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the warrant limits or restricts the federal district court in which a holder of a warrant may bring a\nclaim under the federal securities laws.\nProvisions of our warrants could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of our warrants could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. The warrants prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions\nconstituting “fundamental transactions” unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the warrants. These and other provisions of our warrants\ncould prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to you.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. If no analysts\ncommence coverage of us, or if analysts commence and then cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the\nanalysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price for our common stock would likely decline.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our\ncommon stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to\nother public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved. In addition, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This election allows us to delay\nthe adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a\nresult of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised\naccounting standards. Further, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our\ncommon stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates\nexceeds $700 million, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue\nmore than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common\nstock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act.\nThe limits on the percentage of shares of our common stock that any person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination that could otherwise\nbenefit our stockholders.\nOur charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by our\nBoard, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of our outstanding capital stock or more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our\noutstanding common stock. A person that did not acquire more than 9.8% of our shares may become subject to our charter restrictions if redemptions by other stockholders\ncause such person’s holdings to exceed 9.8% of our outstanding shares. Our 9.8% ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in\ncontrol of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our\nstockholders.\nOur charter permits our Board to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of the holders of our common stock or discourage a third party from\nacquiring us in a manner that could result in a premium price to our stockholders.\nOur Board may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights,\nvoting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock without stockholder\napproval. Thus, our Board could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon\nliquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock. Such preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us,\nincluding an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might otherwise provide a premium price to holders of\nour common stock.\nOur charter includes a provision that may discourage a stockholder from launching a tender offer for our shares.\nOur charter provides that any tender offer made by a person, including any “mini-tender” offer, must comply with most provisions of Regulation 14D of the Exchange Act. The\nofferor must provide the Company notice of such tender offer at least 10 business days before initiating the tender offer. If the offeror does not comply with these requirements,\nno person may transfer any shares held by such person to the offeror without first offering the shares to us at the lowest of (1) the latest offering price of our common stock;\n(2) the fair market value of one share of our common stock as determined by an independent valuation; and (3) the lowest tender offer price offered in such tender offer. In\naddition, the noncomplying offeror person shall be responsible for all of the Company’s expenses in connection with that offeror’s\n31\nnoncompliance. This provision of our charter may discourage a person from initiating a tender offer for our shares and prevent you from receiving a premium price for your\nshares in such a transaction.\nMaryland law and our organizational documents limit our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our directors and officers, which could\nreduce your and our recovery against them if they cause us to incur losses.\nMaryland law provides that a director will not have any liability as a director so long as he or she performs his or her duties in accordance with the applicable standard of\nconduct. In addition, Maryland law and our charter provide that no director or officer shall be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages unless the director or\nofficer (1) actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (2) was actively and deliberately dishonest as established by a final judgment as\nmaterial to the cause of action. Moreover, our charter generally requires us to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers for losses they may incur by reason\nof their service in those capacities unless their act or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was committed in bad faith or was the result of active\nand deliberate dishonesty, they actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or, in the case of any criminal proceeding, they had reasonable\ncause to believe the act or omission was unlawful. Further, we expect to enter into separate indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors. As a result, you\nand we may have more limited rights against our directors or officers than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery from these\npersons if they act in a manner that causes us to incur losses. In addition, we are obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by these persons in some cases.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit transactions or changes of control under circumstances that could otherwise provide stockholders with the\nopportunity to realize a premium.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law applicable to us prohibit business combinations with: (1) any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the\nvoting power of our outstanding voting stock, which we refer to as an “interested stockholder;” (2) an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period\nprior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock, which we also refer to as an “interested stockholder;”\nor (3) an affiliate of an interested stockholder. These prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested\nstockholder. Thereafter, any business combination with the interested stockholder or an affiliate of the interested stockholder must be recommended by our Board and approved\nby the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our outstanding voting stock, and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our\nvoting stock other than shares held by the interested stockholder or its affiliate with whom the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the\ninterested stockholder. These requirements could have the effect of inhibiting a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ best interest. These\nprovisions of Maryland law do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by our Board prior to the time that someone becomes an interested\nstockholder. Pursuant to the business combination statute, our Board has exempted any business combination involving us and any person, provided that such business\ncombination is first approved by a majority of our Board.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management Approach and Strategy\nOur corporate information technology, accounting and financial reporting platforms, and related systems (our “Information Systems”) are necessary for our business. We use\nthese systems, among others, to manage key aspects of our business, including relationships with our tenants and vendors, accounting, acquisitions, internal and external\ncommunications and property and asset management. We also rely on the secure collection, storage, transmission and processing of proprietary, confidential and sensitive data\nrelated to our business (our “Sensitive Data”). We engage a third-party managed information technology service provider (the “MSP”) for cybersecurity services, including\nthreat detection and response, vulnerability assessment and monitoring, security incident response and recovery and general cybersecurity education and awareness. Our\ncybersecurity risk management is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management efforts and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance\nprocesses that apply across our overall enterprise risk management.\nWe and our MSP identify, assess and manage material cybersecurity threats and risks to our Information Systems and Sensitive Data through the following, among others:\n•a multidisciplinary team, including a dedicated technology committee (the “Technology Committee”) comprising members from senior management, asset management\nand accounting and legal functions, in conjunction with our MSP and other third-party service vendors, to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity threats and risks;\n•various internal processes and procedures to monitor and evaluate threat environment and our risk profile using methods such as manual and automated tools,\nsubscribing to reports and services that identify and analyze cybersecurity threats, conducting scans of the threat environment, evaluating our industry’s risk profile,\nutilizing internal and external audits and conducting threat and vulnerability assessments;\n32\n•various technical, physical and organizational processes and policies to manage and mitigate material cybersecurity risks, such as risk assessments, incident detection\nand response, vulnerability management, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, internal controls within our accounting and financial reporting functions,\nencryption of data, network security controls, access controls, physical security, asset management, systems monitoring, vendor risk management program, employee\ntraining and penetration testing; and\n•working with third-party vendors from time to time that assist us to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks, such as professional services firms and penetration\ntesting firms.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe following are characteristics of our properties as of December 31, 2023:\n•Creditworthy Tenants. Approximately 68% of our portfolio’s annualized rent as of December 31, 2023 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company\nhas) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of “BBB-” or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar\nGeneral, and the City of San Antonio, who collectively contributed approximately 39% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent as of December 31, 2023.\n•96% Occupied. Our portfolio is 96% leased and occupied.\n•Contractual Rent Growth. Approximately 84% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2023) provide for increases in\ncontractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n•Average Effective Annual Rental per Square Foot.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, began trading on The\nNasdaq Capital Market on September 8, 2021. On October 1, 2021, the units mandatorily separated into common stock and warrants and ceased trading. On October 4, 2021,\nthe common stock and warrants included in the units commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “GIPR” and “GIPRW,” respectively. As of March\n29, 2024, we had 4,134 shareholders of record. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because shares of our common stock\nare frequently held in “street name” by securities dealers and others for the benefit of beneficial owners who may vote the shares.\nDistributions\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws require that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction\nand excluding any net capital gains, and that it pay tax at U.S. federal corporate income tax rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable\nincome, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains. In addition, a REIT will be required to pay a 4% nondeductible excise\ntax on the amount, if any, by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income, 95% of its capital gain net income, and\n100% of its undistributed income from prior years.\nAlthough we anticipate making monthly distributions to our stockholders, our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing and amount of any distributions\nto our stockholders. As such, we cannot provide any assurance as to the amount or timing of future distributions. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to enable\nus to pay our intended or required distributions, we may be required either to fund distributions from working capital, borrowings, proceeds from the sale of equity securities or\nto reduce the amount of such distributions. Because we have not yet generated a profit, distributions to date have been made from offering proceeds. To be able to pay such\ndividends, our goal is to generate cash distributions from operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of properties. However, until we generate sufficient cash flows, we\nexpect our distributions will be from a combination of operating cash flows and offering proceeds.\nDistributions made by us will be authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion out of funds legally available therefor and will be dependent upon a\nnumber of factors, including restrictions under applicable law and other factors described below. We cannot assure you that our distributions will be made or sustained or that\nour board of directors will not change our distribution policy in the future. Any distributions that we pay in the future will depend upon our actual results of operations,\neconomic conditions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other factors that could differ materially from our current expectations. Our actual results of\noperations will be affected by a number of factors, including our revenue, operating expenses, interest expense and unanticipated expenditures.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2023, we have distributed $3,872,035 to common stockholders. In addition, on January 3, 2024, we announced that our Board of\nDirectors authorized a distribution of $0.039 per share monthly cash distribution for shareholders of record of our common stock as of January 15, 2024, February 15, 2024 and\nMarch 15, 2024. January and February distributions were paid on January 30, 2024, February 29, 2024 and March 29, 2024, respectively. Because we have not yet generated a\ncumulative profit, distributions have been made from proceeds from prior capital raises.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking\nstatements, see the section above entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Summary Risk Factors.” Certain risk factors may cause our actual\nresults, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see Item 1A, “Risk\nFactors.”\nOverview\nWe are an internally managed, Maryland corporation focused on acquiring retail, office and industrial real estate located in major U.S. markets. We initiated operations during\nthe year ended December 31, 2015 and we elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021.\nPublic Offering and Nasdaq Listing\nIn September 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 1,665,000 units at a price to the public of $10 per unit generating net proceeds of $13.8 million\nincluding issuance costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one\nshare of common stock at an exercise price equal to $10 per share. The common stock and warrants included in the units (which were separated into one share of common\nstock and one warrant) currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “GIPR” and “GIPRW,” respectively.\nOur Investments\nThe following are characteristics of our properties as of December 31, 2023:\n•Creditworthy Tenants. Approximately 68% of our portfolio’s annualized rent as of December 31, 2023 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company\nhas) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of “BBB-” or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar\nGeneral, and the City of San Antonio, who collectively contributed approximately 39% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent as of December 31, 2023.\n•96% Occupied. Our portfolio is 96% leased and occupied.\n•Contractual Rent Growth. 84% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2023) provide for increases in contractual base\nrent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods.\n•Average Effective Annual Rental per Square Foot. Average effective annual rental per square foot is $16.02.\nGiven the nature of our leases, our tenants either pay the real estate taxes directly or reimburse us for such costs. We believe all of our properties are adequately covered by\ninsurance.\nThe table below presents an overview of the properties in our portfolio as of December 31, 2023:\n36\nContractual\nRentable Options Rent\nSquare S&P Credit Remaining (Number x Escalations ABR per\nProperty Type Location Feet Tenant Rating (1) Term (Yrs) Yrs) (5) ABR (2) Sq.

We funded the cash portion of the purchase price and the transaction expenses with a combination of cash on hand,\n$21.0 million in new secured mortgage debt, and a $12.0 million preferred equity investment by LC2-NNN Pref, LLC, a Florida limited liability company and\naffiliate of Loci Capital Partners (“LC2”), as summarized below:\nWe, through a newly formed subsidiary, entered into a loan agreement with Valley National Bank in the amount of $21.0 million, which is secured by the\nPortfolio Purchase and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP VB SPE, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“GIP SPE”) that had outstanding\nloans with Valley National Bank. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the\nsubsidiaries of GIP Borrower that hold the properties that comprise the Portfolio Purchase. Payments of interest and principal in the amount of approximately\n$156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date of August 10, 2028. To\nsecure a fixed interest rate on this new debt, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement fixing the interest rate to 7.47%. Our Chief Executive Officer, David\nSobelman, entered into a guarantee\n37\nagreement for $7.5 million pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment obligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-\nboy” provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership.\nOn August 10, 2023, we, through GIP SPE entered into an agreement (the “Amended and Restated LLC Agreement”) whereas LC2 purchased a preferred equity\ninterest (the \"Preferred Interest\") in GIP SPE, providing proceeds of an initial capital contribution of $12.0 million, together with a commitment to make an\nadditional $2.1 million contribution upon the acquisition of our tenant-in-common investment. The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common\ninterest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of $1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. The\nPreferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly (the “Preferred Return”), a portion of which in the\namount of 5% per annum, compounded monthly, is deemed to be a \"Current Preferred Return\", and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum\n(compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “Accrued Preferred Return.” We must redeem the Preferred Interest by August 10, 2025, with two options to extend\nfor an additional 12 months upon payment of an extension fee and an increased preferred rate of return of 18%. LC2 also received a 1% equity fee at closing and\nwill receive a .5% equity fee upon redemption of the Preferred Interest . LC2 will have approval rights to major decisions as defined by the Amended and\nRestated LL Agreement. See Note 6 “Non-Controlling Interests – LC2-NNN Pref, LLC” to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn August 10, 2023, we filed Articles Supplementary (the \"Articles Supplementary\"), with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of\nMaryland, to our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, classifying and designating 2,400,000 shares of our authorized capital stock as shares of\nSeries A Redeemable Preferred Stock. We issued 2,400,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Modiv on August 10, 2023, to fund a portion of the purchase\nprice of the Portfolio Purchase. As set forth in the Articles Supplementary, the Series A Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, senior to all classes or series of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common\nStock”). Holders of Series A Preferred Stock, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available for the\npayment of dividends, are entitled to cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 9.5% per annum of the $5.00 liquidation preference per share, equivalent to a fixed\nannual amount of $0.475 per share, which shall increase to a rate of 12.0% of the $5.00 liquidation preference per share per annum, equivalent to a fixed annual\namount of $0.60 per share, beginning on September 15, 2024. Dividends are payable monthly in arrears on or about the 15th day of each month, beginning on\nSeptember 15, 2023. Dividends will accrue and be cumulative from and including August 10, 2023, the first date on which shares of the Series A Preferred Stock\nwere issued. See Note 7 “Equity – Preferred Stock - Series A Preferred Stock” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for more\ninformation regarding the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock. As discussed below all 2,400,000 Series A Preferred Stock were exchanged for common stock\nsubsequent to December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the Portfolio Purchase as described above, we redeemed the following redeemable non-controlling interests:\n•The Brown Family Trust entered into an agreement to redeem Brown Family Trust's preferred equity interest of $500,000 and a distribution of $1,250 paid on\nAugust 10, 2023.\n•Irby Prop Partners' preferred equity interests of $950,000 and a distribution of $90,070 paid on August 10, 2023.\n•Richard Hornstrom's preferred equity interest of $650,000 and a distribution of $57,780 paid on August 10, 2023.\n•Dividend Declaration\nOn January 3, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a distribution of $0.039 per share monthly cash distribution for shareholders of record\nof our common stock as of January 15, 2024, February 15, 2024 and March 15, 2024. January and February distributions were paid on January 30, 2024,\nFebruary 29, 2024 and March 29, 2024, respectively. Because we have not yet generated a cumulative profit, distributions have been made from proceeds from\nprior capital raises.\n•Series A Preferred Stock Redemption\nOn January 29, 2024 the Company exchanged all shares of its Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock to 2,794,597 shares of our common stock according to the\nfollowing allocation:\n•2,623,153 shares out of the 2,794,597 shares of our common stock were distributed by Modiv OP and subsequently distributed by Modiv to the holders of its\ncommon stock;\n•the remaining 171,444 shares of our common stock issued to Modiv OP will be held by Modiv OP.\n38\nRecent Partnership Developments\n•Agreements with Brown Family Enterprises, LLC\nOn February 8, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreements for GIPVA 2510 Walmer Ave, LLC\n(\"GIPVA 2510\") and GIPVA 130 Corporate Blvd, LLC (\"GIPVA 130\"), in which the Operating Partnership, as the sole member of GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA\n130, admitted a new preferred member, Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, through the issuance of preferred membership interests in the form of Class A Preferred\nUnits of GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130. GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130 (the “Virginia SPEs”) hold the Company’s Norfolk, Virginia properties. In addition, both\nof the Virginia SPEs and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC entered into Unit Purchase Agreements in which GIPVA 2510 issued and sold 180,000 Class A\nPreferred Units at a price of $10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of $1,800,000, and GIPVA 130 issued and sold 120,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of\n$10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of $1,200,000. The Operating Partnership is the general manager of the subsidiary while Brown Family Enterprises, LLC is\na preferred equity member. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is required to pay the preferred equity member a 7% IRR paid on a monthly basis and will\nshare in 16% of the equity in each of the Virginia SPEs upon a capital transaction resulting in distributable proceeds. After 24 months, Brown Family Enterprises,\nLLC has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value. Because of the redemption right, the non-controlling interest is presented as temporary\nequity at an aggregated redemption value of $3,000,000 as of December 31, 2023.\n•Agreement with LMB Owenton I, LLC\nOn February 7, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into a Unit Issuance Agreement and Amendment to Contribution and Subscription Agreement with LMB\nOwenton I LLC in which the Operating Partnership and LMB Owenton I LLC agreed to delay the Contributor’s right to require the redemption of the\nContributor’s GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership until after 36 months on January 14th, 2025 and for a reduced redemption price of $7.15 per GIP LP\nUnit. Such agreement was made in consideration of the issuance to LMB Owenton I LLC of an additional 44,228 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership,\nresulting in Contributor owning an aggregate of 155,185 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at redemption value of $1,109,570 as of December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nOur management team’s evaluation of operating results includes an assessment of our ability to generate cash flow necessary to pay operating expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, debt service, and to fund dividends to our stockholders. As a result, our management team’s assessment of operating results gives less emphasis to the\neffects of unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which may cause fluctuations in net income\nfor comparable periods but have no impact on cash flows. Our management team’s evaluation of our potential for generating cash flow includes on-going assessments of our\nexisting portfolio of properties, our non-stabilized properties, long-term sustainability of our real estate portfolio, our future operating cash flow from anticipated acquisitions,\nand the proceeds from the sales of our real estate assets.\nIn addition, our management team evaluates our portfolio and individual properties’ results of operations with a primary focus on increasing and enhancing the value, quality\nand quantity of properties in our real estate holdings. Our management team focuses its efforts on improving underperforming assets through re-leasing efforts, including\nnegotiation of lease renewals and rental rates. Properties that have reached goals in occupancy and rental rates are evaluated for potential added value appreciation and, if\nlacking such potential, are sold with the equity reinvested in properties that have better potential without foregoing cash flow. Our ability to increase assets under management\nis affected by our ability to raise borrowings and/or capital, coupled with our ability to identify appropriate investments.\nOur results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are not indicative of those expected in future periods, as we expect that rental income,\ninterest expense, rental operating expense, general and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization will significantly change in future periods as a result of growth\nthrough future acquisitions of real estate related investments.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenue\nFor Twelve months ended December 31, 2023, total revenue from operations was $7,632,600 as compared to $5,432,462 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nRevenue increased by $2,200,138 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2022 from the Modiv acquisition in August 2023.\nExpenses\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 expenses incurred were as follows:\n39\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\nGeneral and administrative expense $ 1,734,134 $ 1,647,987 $ 86,147\nBuilding expenses 1,699,200 1,208,192 491,008\nDepreciation and amortization 3,539,569 2,110,975 1,428,594\nInterest expense, net 2,744,406 1,620,237 1,124,169\nCompensation costs 1,372,539 1,310,796 61,743\nTotal expenses $ 11,089,848 $ 7,898,187 $ 3,191,661\n•General and administrative expense increased by $86,147, or 5%, driven by increases in audit fees, insurance, and partially offset by reductions in stock issuance costs\nand professional services.\n•Building expenses increased by $491,008, or 41%, due to the acquisition of 13 properties from Modiv in August 2023.\n•Depreciation and amortization increased by $1,427,594, or 68%, from the acquisition of 13 properties from Modiv in August 2023.\n•Interest expense, net increased by $1,124,169, or 69%, due to interest on mortgage loans secured by the 13 property portfolio acquired from Modiv in August 2023.\nAdditionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a guaranty fee expense of $290,416 payable to our President and CEO of which $177,347\nremained payable as of December 31, 2023.\n•Compensation costs remained flat, with the exception of a one-time payment of approximately $58,000 paid to the former CFO, who departed in November 2023.\nNet Loss\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated a net loss of $4,441,465 and 2,747,178, respectively.\nIncome on Investment in Tenancy in Common\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our share of earnings on our investment in tenancy in common and accounted for under the equity method\ngenerated income of $32,773 and $37,298, respectively. On September 7, 2023, the Company purchased the remaining tenancy-in-common (\"TIC\") interest and assumed\ncontrol of the property.\nNet Loss Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $1,275,797 and $490,462, respectively. The increase is\nprimarily attributable to LC2-NNN Pref, LLC's $14,100,000 preferred equity investment in conjunction with the Modiv acquisition in August 2023.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated a net loss attributable to our common shareholders of $6,192,262 and $3,237,640, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund our investment activities and operating expenses. Our capital sources may include net proceeds from offerings of our equity securities, cash flow\nfrom operations and borrowings under credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, we had total cash (unrestricted and restricted) of $3,151,946, properties with a cost basis of\n$104,912,421 and outstanding debt of $56,817,310.\nOn April 1, 2022, we entered into two mortgage loan agreements with an aggregate balance of $13.5 million to refinance seven of our properties. The loan agreements consist\nof one loan in the amount of $11.4 million secured by six properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value, and one loan in the amount of $2.1\nmillion on the property previously held in the tenancy-in-common investment at an interest rate of 3.85% from April 1, 2022 through and until March 31, 2027. In conjunction\nwith the LC2 Investment to purchase the remaining interest in the tenancy-in-common interest discussed above, we assumed the original $2.1 million loan on the property with a\nbalance as of December 31, 2023 of $2,066,604 and recognized a discount of $383,767. Effective April 1, 2027 and through the maturity date of March 31, 2032, the interest\nrate adjusts to the 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and is subject to a floor of 3.85%. Our CEO entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment\nobligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-boy” provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership.\nOur President and CEO has personally guaranteed the repayment of the $10.8 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks-South Tampa, FL; and Pratt & Whitney-\nHuntsville, AL loan as well as the $1.3 million loan secured by our Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL\n40\nmortgage loan. In addition, our President and CEO has also provided a guaranty of the Borrower’s nonrecourse carveout liabilities and obligations in favor of the lender for the\nGSA and PRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA mortgage loans with an aggregate principal amount of $11.9 million.\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered a Redemption Agreement with a unit holder. As such, we recorded an Other payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution\nof the Redemption Agreement entered into July 20, 2022 and have made installment payments to date of $1,102,460 with a remaining balance of $1,809,840 outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOn October 14, 2022, we entered into a loan transaction that is evidenced by a secured non-convertible promissory note to Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, a preferred equity\npartner and therefore a related party, for $1.5 million that is due on October 14, 2024, and bears a fixed interest rate of 9%, simple interest. Interest is payable monthly. The\nloan may be repaid without penalty at any time. The loan is secured by the Operating Partnership’s equity interest in its current direct subsidiaries that hold real estate assets\npursuant to the terms of a security agreement between the Operating Partnership and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC. On July 21, 2023, the Company amended and restated the\npromissory note to reflect an increase in the loan to $5.5 million and extend the maturity date thereof from October 14, 2024 to October 14, 2026. Except for the increase in the\namount of the Loan and Note and the extension of the maturity date thereof, no changes were made to the original note.\nOn August 10, 2023, we entered into a $21.0 million loan agreement with Valley National Bank (\"Valley\") to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The outstanding\nprincipal amount of the loan bears interest at an annual rate for each 30-day interest period equal to the compounded average of the secured overnight financing rate published\nby Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the thirty-day period prior to the last day of each 30-day interest rate for the applicable interest rate period plus 3.25%, with interest\npayable monthly after each 30-day interest period. However, we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47% per annum. Payments of interest and\nprincipal in the amount of approximately $156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date\nof August 10, 2028. The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid financing fees.\nThe loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP SPE that\nhad outstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the subsidiaries that\nhold the properties subject to the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement requires a minimum debt-service coverage ratio 1.50:1 on a trailing twelve-month\nbasis, tested as of December 31, 2024 and annually thereafter. Our President and CEO also entered into a personal, full recourse guarantee with a $7,500,000 cap.\nWe currently obtain the capital required to primarily invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial net lease real estate investments and conduct our operations\nfrom the proceeds of equity offerings, debt financings, preferred minority interest obtained from third parties, issuance of Operating Partnership units and from any\nundistributed funds from our operations.\nWe anticipate that our current cash on hand and availability under the Facility combined with the revenue generated from investment properties and proceeds from debt\narrangements will provide sufficient liquidity to meet future funding commitments for at least the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had accounts payable, accrued expenses and insurance payable totaling $1,813,231 and $714,354, respectively.\nOutstanding indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n41\nOriginal\nLoan Interest Maturity 12/31/2 12/31/2 Debt Service Coverage\nMortgage Loans Secured By Location Amount Rate Date 023 022 Ratios (\"DSCR\") Required\n7-Eleven Corporation, Starbucks Washington, D.C., $ 11,28 (a) 4.17% 3/6/2030 $10,757 $10,957 1.25\nCorporation, and Pratt & Whitney Tampa, FL, and 7,500 ,239 ,829\nAutomation, Inc.

The Purchaser will be paid an annual 7% preferred return on the preferred units of the Virginia SPEs (the “SPE\nPreferred Units”), payable on a monthly basis, and will share in approximately 16% of the equity in each of the Virginia SPEs. The Purchaser and the respective SPEs will both\nhave the right to redeem the SPE Preferred Units after two (2) years for cash in the amount of the Purchaser’s unreturned capital contribution and accrued but unpaid preferred\nreturn (the “Redemption Price”), provided that Purchaser will have the right to take the Redemption Price (or any portion thereof) in common units of the Operating Partnership\nat a conversion price equal to 85% of the average trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 30 trading days preceding redemption. The proceeds from the sale of\nthe SPE Preferred Units were distributed to the Operating Partnership to fund the Operating Partnership’s redemption obligations from two members of the Operating\nPartnership who redeemed a total of 123,965 units both on January 27, 2023 at $20 per unit in the aggregate amount of $2,479,299 and to fund general corporate expenses of the\nOperating Partnership. We funded the redemption obligations per the terms of the contribution agreement on February 9, 2023. During the Twelve months ended December 31,\n2023, we accrued approximately $506,000 relating to the potential reimbursement of federal, state and local income taxes incurred by a remaining partner in one of our\npartnerships pursuant to tax protection agreement.\nThe primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility using retained cash flows, long-term debt and common and perpetual preferred stock to\nfinance our growth. We intend to have a lower-leveraged portfolio over the long-term after we have acquired an initial substantial portfolio of diversified investments. During\nthe period when we are acquiring our current portfolio, we will employ greater leverage on individual assets (that will also result in greater leverage of the current portfolio) in\norder to quickly build a diversified portfolio of assets.\nCash from Operations Activities\nNet cash provided by operations was $12,345 and $583,884 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change is primarily due to the year\nover year increases in Accounts receivable, Escrow deposits and other assets, and Prepaid expenses driven by the doubling of the property portfolio in August 2023.\nCash from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing was $33,314,974 and $13,281,248 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change is primarily due to the\nacquisition of the Modiv portfolio in August 2023.\nCash from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $32,701,579 and $5,826,284 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change is primarily due\nto the acquisition of the Modiv portfolio in August 2023.\nFuture Rental Payments\nThe following table presents future minimum rental cash payments due to the Company over the next five calendar years and thereafter as of December 31:\n43\nAs of December 31,\n2023\n2024 $ 8,048,449\n2025 7,798,628\n2026 7,458,648\n2027 5,835,157\n2028 4,376,385\nThereafter 8,669,905\n$ 42,187,172\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial\ncondition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAs a company primarily involved in owning income generating real estate assets, management considers the following accounting policies critical as they reflect our more\nsignificant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial\nresults. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our\nfinancial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in\nsimilar businesses.\nInvestments in Real Estate.\nAcquisitions of real estate are recorded at cost. The Company assigns the purchase price of real estate to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair value.\nTangible assets consist of land, buildings, site improvements and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the value of in-place leases and above or below\nmarket leases assumed with the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, the Company assesses whether the purchase of the real estate falls within the definition of a business\nunder Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 and to date has concluded that all asset transactions are asset acquisitions. Therefore, each acquisition has been recorded\nat the purchase price whereas assets and liabilities, inclusive of closing costs, are allocated to land, building, site improvements, tenant improvements and intangible assets and\nliabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.\nThe fair value of the in-place leases is estimated as the cost to replace the leases including loss of rent, commissions and legal fees. The in-place leases are amortized over the\nremaining term of the leases as amortization expense. The fair value of the above- or below- market lease is estimated as the present value of the difference between the\ncontractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the estimated current market lease rate expected over the remaining non-cancelable life of the lease. The\ncapitalized above or below market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase to rental income over the remaining term of the lease inclusive of the renewal option\nperiods that are considered probable at acquisition.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds\nfrom operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We\nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating\nperformance of REITs.\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly,\nthey should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a\nliquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT\ndefines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment\nwrite-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets, and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of\nunconsolidated subsidiaries. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible\namortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\n44\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it\nexcludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate\ndiminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors\nto consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not\nbe comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors\nbecause they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our\nperformance when we formulate corporate goals.\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items, it\nprovides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and\nadministrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative\nmeasure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to\nmaintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO\ndoes not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\nThe following tables reconcile net income (net loss), which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and Core AFFO:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet loss $ (4,441,465) $ (2,747,178)\nOther expense 506,639 -\nLoss on derivative valuation, net 401,782 -\nDepreciation and amortization 3,538,569 2,110,975\nFunds From Operations $ 5,525 $ (636,203)\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 146,745 118,930\nNon-cash stock compensation 382,002 421,882\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs - 252,256\nAdjustments to Funds From Operations 528,747 793,068\nCore Funds From Operations\n$ 534,272 $ 156,865\nNet loss $ (4,441,465) $ (2,747,178)\nOther expense 506,639 -\nLoss on derivative valuation, net 401,782 -\nDepreciation and amortization 3,538,569 2,110,975\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 146,745 118,930\nAbove and below-market lease amortization, net (2,873) (102,775)\nStraight line rent, net 64,572 53,193\nAdjustments to net loss $ 4,655,434 $ 2,180,323\nAdjusted Funds From Operations $ 213,969 $ (566,855)\nDead deal expense $ 109,569 $ 174,722\nLoss on debt extinguishment - 144,029\nNon-cash stock compensation 382,002 421,882\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs - 252,256\nAdjustments to Adjusted Funds From Operations $ 491,571 $ 992,889\nCore Adjusted Funds From Operations $ 705,540 $ 426,034\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”)\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things, exemptions for emerging growth\ncompanies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years.\nIn general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8,\n2011 and the company had less than $1.07 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company, but\nwill no longer qualify after the earliest of:\n•the last day of the fiscal year during which we have annual total gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more;\n•the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities in an offering registered under the Securities Act;\n•the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during a previous three-year period; or\n45\n•the date on which we become a large accelerated filer, which generally is a company with a public float of at least $700 million (Exchange Act Rule 12b-2).\nAs an emerging growth company, we are eligible to include audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years and limited executive compensation information.\nPursuant to the relief for emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to file an attestation report on our\ninternal controls over financial reporting and is exempt from the mandatory auditor rotation rules.\nIn addition, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange\nAct) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. The decision by companies to “opt out” of the extended transition period for complying with\nnew or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We are not electing to opt out of the JOBS Act extended accounting transition period. We intend to take advantage of the\nextended transition period provided under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nTo the extent we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements afforded by the JOBS Act, investors may be less likely to invest in us or may view our shares as a\nriskier investment than a similarly situated company that does not take advantage of these provisions.\nITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their\ncash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial\nstatements, the Company has incurred recurring losses and does not have sufficient current and anticipated liquidity to fulfill its liabilities, which raise substantial\ndoubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not\ninclude any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no\nsuch opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.\nHouston, Texas\nApril 8, 2024\n48\nGeneration Income Properties, Inc.

(the “Company”) was formed as a Maryland corporation in September 2015. The Company is an internally managed real estate investment\ncompany focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail, office and industrial properties net leased to high quality tenants in major markets throughout the\nUnited States.\nThe Company formed Generation Income Properties L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) in October 2015. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by, and operations\nare conducted through the Operating Partnership. The Company is the general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of December 31, 2023 owned 90.7% of the\noutstanding common units of the Operating Partnership. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC in 2018 that owns 0.002% of the Operating\nPartnership.\nThe Company places each property in a separate entity which may have a Redeemable Non-Controlling interest as a member.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis owned 26 properties. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company owned 12 properties and held partial interests in one additional property through a tenancy-in-common investment.\nManagement’s Liquidity Plans and Going Concern\nOn August 27, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-05, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess\na company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from financial statement issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In\naccordance with ASU 2014-05, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the\nissuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will\nalleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial\nStatements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated operating cash flows of $12,345 and had cash on hand of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nTwo secured mortgage loans which have a principal balance of $7.3 million and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2023 will mature on September 30, 2024 and October 23,\n2024, respectively. Our current and anticipated liquidity is less than the principal balance of these obligations. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs,\nand our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued.\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability,\nwhich includes a plan to refinance these two mortgage loans at maturity. The Company has been engaged in active conversations with the current lender on a refinance. There\nis no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such refinance on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into\ncollaborations or other arrangements. The failure of the Company to refinance on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nNote 2 – Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company adopted the calendar year as its basis of reporting. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.\nThese reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.\nConsolidation\n55\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Generation Income Properties, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and all of the direct and\nindirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company’s subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been\neliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. The ownership interests of other investors in these\nentities are recorded as non-controlling interests or redeemable non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are adjusted each period for additional contributions,\ndistributions, and the allocation of net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interests. Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over, but does not have financial or operating control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company’s share of\nthe earnings (or losses) of these entities are included in consolidated net income or loss.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company’s management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is possible that the estimates\nand assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.\nCash\nThe Company considers all demand deposits, cashier’s checks and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. Amounts included in restricted cash represent funds held\nby the Company related to tenant escrow reimbursements and immediate repair reserve. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash\nequivalents and restricted cash that sums to the total of those amounts at the end of the periods presented on the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows:\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,117,446 $ 3,718,496\nRestricted cash 34,500 34,500\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 3,151,946 $ 3,752,996\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company expensed $0 and $252,256 of stock issuance costs deferred for professional fees incurred for offerings\nno longer intended.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company leases real estate to its tenants under long-term net leases which the Company accounts for as operating leases. Those leases that have fixed and determinable\nrent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to straight-line rents, deferred rent liability includes prepaid rent of the following:\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2023 2022\nPrepaid Rent $ 280,332 $ 271,189\nThe Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant’s\npayment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area where the\nproperty is located. In the event that collectability exists with respect to any tenant changes, the Company would recognize an adjustment to rental income. The Company’s\nreview of collectability of charges under its operating leases includes any accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line rents. There were no allowances for receivables\nrecorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company’s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance (“CAM”), insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. A portion\nof our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued.\n56\nThe Company often recognizes above- and below-market lease intangibles in connection with acquisitions of real estate. The capitalized above- and below-market lease\nintangibles are amortized over the remaining term of the related leases.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records all equity-based incentive grants to employees and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors in compensation costs in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their fair values determined on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated\nforfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the outstanding equity awards.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nAcquisitions of real estate are recorded at cost. The Company assigns the purchase price of real estate to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair value.\nTangible assets consist of land, buildings, site improvements and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the value of in-place leases and above or\nbelow market leases assumed with the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, the Company assesses whether the purchase of the real estate falls within the definition of a\nbusiness under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 and to date has concluded that all asset transactions are asset acquisitions. Therefore, each acquisition has\nbeen recorded at the purchase price whereas assets and liabilities, inclusive of closing costs, are allocated to land, building, site improvements, tenant improvements and\nintangible assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.\nThe fair value of the in-place leases are estimated as the cost to replace the leases including loss of rent, commissions and legal fees. The in-place leases are amortized over\nthe remaining team of the leases as amortization expense. The fair value of the above- or below- market lease is estimated as the present value of the difference between the\ncontractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the estimated current market lease rate expected over the remaining non-cancelable life of the lease. The\ncapitalized above or below market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase to rental income over the remaining term of the lease inclusive of the renewal option\nperiods that are considered probable at acquisition.\nDepreciation Expense\nReal estate and related assets are stated net of accumulated depreciation. Renovations, replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of assets are\ncapitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is\ncomputed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the buildings, which are generally between 15 and 50 years, and site improvements, which are\ngenerally between 5 to 9 years. Tenant improvements are amortized over the lease terms of the tenants, which is generally between 2 and 10 years, with two tenant\nimprovements amortized over 27 years.\nLease Liabilities\nThe Company has a certain property within its portfolio that is on land subject to a ground lease with a third party, which is classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, the\nCompany owns only a long-term leasehold in this property. The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as investment in real estate in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\nUnder ASC 842, the Company recognizes a Lease liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its ground lease and corresponding Right of use asset related to this same\nground lease which is classified as an operating lease. A key input in estimating the Lease liability and resulting Right of use asset is establishing the discount rate in the\nlease, which since the rate implicit in the contract is not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground lease, including mortgage market-based\ninterest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and the payment terms present in the lease. This discount rate is applied to\nthe remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for the lease to measure the Lease liability.\nImpairments\nThe Company reviews real estate investments and related lease intangibles, for possible impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable through operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Events or changes in circumstances that may occur include, but\nare not limited to, significant changes in real estate market conditions, estimated residual values, and an expectation to sell assets before the end of the previously estimated\nlife. Impairments are measured to the extent the current book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less disposition costs for any assets classified as held for\nsale. There were no impairments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n57\nThe valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, and\npurchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. The Company may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as\nappropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results.\nA loss in value of investments in real estate partnerships under the equity method of accounting, other than a temporary decline, must be recognized in the period in which\nthe loss occurs. If the Company identifies events or circumstances that indicate that the value of the Company's investment may be impaired, it evaluates the investment by\ncalculating the estimated fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment. There were no impairments in the\nCompany's Investment in tenancy-in-common during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under Section 856 through b860 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) commencing with out\ntaxable year ending December 31, 2021. To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a\nrequirement to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that\nportion of its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements relates to the Company's consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary of which no income was generated during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company also recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is not more-likely-than-not\nthat the positions will be sustained on examination, including resolution of the related processes, if any. As of each balance sheet date, unrecognized benefits are reassessed\nand adjusted if the Company’s judgment changes as a result of new information. No liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company's tax returns for the years 2019 forward remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.\nEarnings per Share\nIn accordance with ASC 260, basic earnings/loss per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss attributable to the Company that is available to common stockholders\nby the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of restricted stock-based compensation awards. Diluted EPS gives\neffect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock warrants, using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock\nprice for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of warrants), and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. Diluted\nEPS excludes all potentially dilutive securities such as warrants, options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the total number of common stock equivalents was 989,716 and 1,161,402, respectively, and composed of stock warrants and unvested restricted shares. The\nCompany incurred a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share for those periods are the\nsame because all potential common equivalent shares would be antidilutive.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values of our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and discount rates. Such\namounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to estimates that may change in the future. See Note 12 for additional information.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value\nhierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within\nLevels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\n58\n•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.\nThe Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at\nfair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs. See Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 12 for additional information on the Company's fair\nvalue measurements.\nNote 3 – Investments in Real Estate\nAcquisitions:\nOn January 7, 2022, the Company acquired an approximately 10,900 square foot single tenant medical-retail property leased to Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE: FMS) located\nin Chicago, Illinois.

After 24 months, Richard Hornstrom has the right to\nredeem the preferred equity at redemption value plus any deferred interest accrued and the Operating Partnership has the right to call the preferred equity at redemption value.\nBecause of the redemption right, the non-controlling interest was presented as temporary equity at redemption value. On August 10, 2023, the Company exercised its right to\ncall the preferred equity at redemption value and redeemed the preferred equity upon payment of the original capital contribution plus accrued and deferred interest.\nLC2-NNN Pref, LLC\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio, the Operating Partnership and LC2 entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement\nfor GIP SPE (the “GIP SPE Operating Agreement”) pursuant to which LC2 made a $12.0 million initial capital contribution to GIP SPE, together with a commitment to\nmake an additional $2.1 million contribution upon the satisfactory completion of the acquisition of a tenant-in-common interest held by a third party in the Company’s\nRockford, Illinois property (the “LC2 Investment”). The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of\n$1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest\nin GIP SPE (the “Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in\nthe amount of 5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum\n(compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first\nto LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current\n63\npreferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is less than 10%, in which case the balance will be\npaid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month annualized adjusted net\noperating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions\nwill be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2\nInvestment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.\nThe Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the\nLC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount. Upon a failure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at\nan increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month\nextension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is\nincreased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as\ndefined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’ senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period,\nand there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.\nUnder the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having\nbeen paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $87,264 of issuance costs related to the issuance of the Preferred Interest. Because of the redemption right,\nthe Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of $602,853 as of December 31, 2023.\nEach of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the\ndiscretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the\nOperating Partnership (\"GIP LP Units\"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the\nOperating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such\npreferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units\nshall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership.\nAdditionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the\nacquisition.\nNon-Controlling Interest (Permanent Equity)\nGIP LP (Former GIP Fund 1 Members)\nAs part of the Company’s acquisition of one property on November 30, 2020 for $1,847,700 in Tampa, FL, the Operating Partnership entered into a contribution agreement\nwith GIP Fund 1, LLC that resulted in the issuance of 24,309 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at $20.00 per share for a total value of $486,180. At the time of the\nacquisition, the Company’s President owned 11% of GIP Fund 1. GIP Fund 1 has since been dissolved and the GIP Units are now directly owned by the former members of\nGIP Fund 1. After 12 months, the contribution agreement allows for the former members of GIP Fund 1 to require the Operating Partnership to redeem, all or a portion of its\nGIP LP Units for common stock of the Company. As such, the Company has determined their equity should be classified as a Non-controlling interest.\nFollowing these transactions as of December 31, 2023, the Company owned 90.7% of the common units in the Operating Partnership and outside investors owned 9.3%.\nThe following table reflects our Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n64\nGIP LP\nBrown (Former Non-\nFamily Greenwal, Controllin\nTrust and L.C. and Total g Interests\nBrown Riverside Redeemab - Former\nFamily LMB Crossing, le Non- GIP Fund\nEnterprise Irby Prop Richard Owenton I L.C.

The Company's Rental income is comprised of both fixed and variable income. Fixed and in-substance fixed\nlease income includes stated amounts per the lease contract, which are primarily related to base rent.

A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue\nis estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued. Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-\nline basis. Variable lease income includes the tenants' contractual obligations to reimburse the Company for their portion of Recoverable Costs incurred.

In addition, two mortgage loans, one encumbered by six properties\nand requiring a 1.50 DSCR, and another stand alone mortgage loan requiring a 1.50 DSCR, require the Company to maintain a 54% loan to fair market stabilized value ratio.\nFair market stabilized value shall be determined by the lender by reference to acceptable guides and indices or appraisals from time to time at its discretion. As of December\n31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants with the exception of one project level DSCR covenant for 2510 Walmer Ave. Our Bayport Credit Union loan\ncovenant requires project level, property level and portfolio level DSCR minimum testing. At the project-level, 2510 Walmer Ave tested at a 1.17:1 DSCR, compared with the\n1.25:1 project level minimum DSCR, driven by its vacancy since January 2023. According to the governing loan document, failing to meet DSCR coverage requirements is a\ntechnical default triggering the risk of forfeiture of the property, accelerating the repayment of the remaining outstanding balance of the loan at the lender's discretion. All\nother DSCR covenants tested compliant and the lender has indicated no intention of action. Additionally, a new lease was executed for 2510 Walmer Ave. on March 28, 2024\nand will restore the property to full occupancy upon commencement.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company entered into two mortgage loan agreements with an aggregate balance of $13.5 million to refinance seven of the Company's properties.

In conjunction with the LC2 Investment to purchase the remaining interest in the tenancy-in-common interest discussed above, the Company assumed the\noriginal $2.1 million loan on the property with a remaining balance of $2,079,178 and recognized a discount of $383,767. Effective April 1, 2027 and through the maturity\ndate of March 31, 2032, the interest rate adjusts to the 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and is subject to a floor of 3.85%. The Company’s CEO entered into a guarantee agreement\npursuant to which he guaranteed the payment obligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-boy” provisions, individually and on\nbehalf of the Operating Partnership. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $144,029 related to the\nwrite off of unamortized debt issuance costs previously incurred on refinanced mortgage loans including a prepayment penalty incurred of $21,000.\nOn August 10, 2023, GIP13, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GIP SPE (\"GIP Borrower\"), entered into a Loan Agreement with\nValley pursuant to which Valley made a loan to the Company in the amount of $21.0 million to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio.

However, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47% per annum. Payments of interest\nand principal in the amount of approximately $156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a\nmaturity date of August 10, 2028. The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid\nfinancing fees. The loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by\nsubsidiaries of GIP SPE that had outstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating\nPartnership and the subsidiaries of the Company that hold the properties that comprise the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement also provides for customary events of default\nand other customary affirmative and negative covenants that are applicable to GIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, including reporting covenants and restrictions on\ninvestments, additional indebtedness, liens, sales of properties, certain mergers, and certain management changes. The Company's President and CEO also entered into a\npersonal, full recourse guarantee with a $7,500,000 cap.\nThe Company’s President and CEO also has personally guaranteed the repayment of the $10.8 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks-South Tampa, FL;\nand Pratt & Whitney-Huntsville, AL loan as well as the $1.3 million loan secured by the Company's Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL mortgage loan.

The new Commitment Letter will become effective contingent upon the Company completing a future capital\nraise of $25.0 million or more, and prior to such time, the current Commitment Letter will remain in place. On September 9, 2022, the Company and AMB combined the\nprior AMB commitment letters entered into in October 2021 and May 2022 into a single Commitment Letter, and have amended the rate index used for borrowing to be a\nvariable rate equal to the 30-Day CME Term SOFR Rate, plus a margin of 2.40%, adjusted monthly, subject to a floor interest\n73\nrate of 3.25% per year.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a Derivative Liability of $537,424 and Derivative asset of $135,642, which was included in\nEscrow Deposits and Other assets on the face of the balance sheet.\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected\ncash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs,\nincluding interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and\nthe respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. All inputs are considered Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are\nsupported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCarrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,117,446 $ 3,117,446 $ 3,718,496 $ 3,718,496\nRestricted cash 34,500 34,500 34,500 34,500\nInterest rate swaps 135,642 135,642 - -\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps 537,424 537,424 - -\nNote 13 – Subsequent Events\nOn January 3, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a distribution of $0.039 per share or per unit monthly cash distribution for shareholders and\nunitholders of record of our common stock and partnership units, respectively, as of January 15, 2024, February 15, 2024 and March 15, 2024.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n\"Exchange Act\"). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as\nof the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including our\npresident and principal accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP, was not required to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 because as an “emerging growth company” we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) On March 28, 2024 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement between GIPAL JV 15091 SW Alabama 20, LLC and 144 Property Group, LLC for the sale of the property\nlocated at 15091 SW Alabama 20, Huntsville AL for total consideration of $6,150,000.

Purchaser shall obtain, at Purchaser’s expense and at standard rates, an owner’s policy of title\ninsurance in an amount no less than the Purchase Price (the “Title Policy”).\n1\nExhibit 10.68\nWithin twenty (20) days of the Effective Date, Purchaser shall, at its own expense, cause Maynard Nexsen PC, as issuing agent\nfor First American Title Insurance Company (the “Title Company”), with an address of 655 Gallatin Street, Huntsville, Alabama\n35801, to issue and deliver to Purchaser the most recent ALTA Form (Alabama) title insurance commitment (the “Title\nCommitment”) for the Title Policy. The Title Commitment shall evidence that upon the execution, delivery and recordation of the\nDeed (which shall be delivered by Seller at the Closing provided for hereunder) and the satisfaction of all requirements specified\nin Schedule B, Section 1 of the Title Commitment, Purchaser shall acquire fee simple title to the Property, subject only to the\n“Permitted Exceptions.” For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Permitted Exceptions” shall mean: (i) applicable zoning and\nbuilding ordinances and land use regulations; (ii) the lien of any and all taxes and assessments not yet due and payable; (iii)\neasements, licenses, covenants, conditions, restrictions, leases, reservations, exceptions and other encumbrances referenced\nin the Title Commitment and not objected to by Purchaser in the Notice of Title Objections (defined below); (iv) any matters\naffecting title that would be disclosed by an accurate survey of the Property and which are not timely objected to by Purchaser in\nthe Notice of Title Objections or pursuant to Section 4.2; (v) any exceptions caused by Purchaser, its agents, representatives or\nemployees; (vi) any matters accepted or deemed accepted by Purchaser pursuant to the terms and conditions of this\nAgreement, and (vii) any matters agreed to by the parties in writing.\n2\nExhibit 10.68\nWithin thirty (30) days after the Effective Date (the “Objection Period”), Purchaser (i) shall deliver to Seller copies of\nthe Title Commitment and all exception documents referenced in Schedule B, Sections 1 and 2, of the Title\nCommitment, and (ii) may deliver to Seller written notice of any matters in the Title Commitment that are objectionable\nto, or deemed a title defect, by Purchaser (“Notice of Title Objections”). Any title defect to which Purchaser does not\ntimely object shall be deemed a Permitted Exception hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the\ncontrary, Seller shall be obligated to cure the following defects to the extent that and only to the extent that the same\nare specified in the Title Commitment and/or the Updated Title Commitment (collectively, the “Mandatory Cure\nDefects”): (a) mortgages arising through Seller, (b) construction liens arising through Seller, (c) back taxes on the\nProperty that are due and payable, (d) judgment liens arising through Seller, and (e) other liens or encumbrances\narising through Seller and securing amounts owed. As to any defects other than Mandatory Cure Defects, Seller shall\nhave fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Notice of Title Objections in which to elect either to (i) notify Purchaser that it\nintends to cure the identified objections and defects on or before the Closing Date (the “Title Cure Period”) and Seller\nshall use reasonable efforts to cure such objections and defects; or (ii) notify Purchaser that Seller elects not to cure\nthe objections or alleged defects. In the event Seller fails to deliver a response within fifteen (15) days after receipt\nfrom Purchaser of the Notice of Title Objections, Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to cure or eliminate said\nobjections and alleged title defects. Purchaser shall have until the later of the expiration of the Due Diligence Period\n(defined below) or ten (10) days from receipt of Seller’s notice, or Seller’s deemed notice, of its election not to cure\nPurchaser’s objections and alleged title defects (whichever is later), in which to elect either (x) to terminate the\nAgreement, or (y) to require Seller to deliver title in its then existing condition (with no reduction in the Purchase Price)\nand to proceed to Closing notwithstanding the objections to title raised by Purchaser, yet still subject to Seller’s\nobligation to cure the Mandatory Cure Defects. The foregoing remedies shall constitute the exclusive remedies of\nPurchaser for such failure to deliver title as herein specified; provided, however, Seller’s failure to cure Mandatory\nCure Defects at Closing will be a default and Purchaser shall have the remedies as set forth in Section 13.\n3\nExhibit 10.68\nWithin five (5) business days prior to Closing, Purchaser may cause the Title Company to deliver to Purchaser an\nupdate to the Title Commitment (the “Updated Title Commitment”). Any matter disclosed in the Updated Title\nCommitment which was not an exception in the Title Commitment shall automatically be deemed a title defect which\nSeller shall be obligated to cure unless the same was either (i) caused by or through the acts or omissions of\nPurchaser or its agents, invitees, or contractors, (ii) discharged or endorsed over to Purchaser’s commercially\nreasonable satisfaction in the Title Policy at Closing, or (iii) consented or agreed to by Purchaser in writing. Purchaser\nshall notify Seller within three (3) business days after Purchaser becomes aware of any such new title matter to which\nPurchaser objects, and if Purchaser does not notify Seller of any objection within such three (3) business day period,\nPurchaser shall be deemed to have waived any such objection and shall proceed to Closing without any credit or\nreduction in the Purchase Price because of such title matter. If Purchaser properly and timely notifies Seller of any new\ntitle matter to which Purchaser objects, then Seller shall have the right to extend the Closing Date by up to sixty (60)\ndays to permit Seller to cure such objection. If Seller either declines to cure or fails to timely cure any of Purchaser’s\nobjections with respect to such new title matter(s) (other than Mandatory Cure Defects, which Seller is obligated under\nthis Agreement to cure by Closing), Purchaser shall have the right to accept title or terminate this Agreement\nspecifically as set forth in this Section 4.1.\n4.2Survey. Purchaser may, on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, cause an ALTA/NSPS land title survey (the\n“Survey”) of the Property to be prepared by a professional surveyor registered and licensed in the State of Alabama (the\n“Surveyor”). Such Survey, if any, shall depict the Property by metes and bounds description. The Survey shall be certified by\nthe Surveyor to Purchaser, Seller and the Title Company and shall otherwise be in a form satisfactory to the Title Company to\neliminate the standard survey exceptions from the Title Policy to be issued at Closing. Within the Objection Period, Purchaser\nmay notify Seller in writing of any matters shown on the Survey (together with delivery of an electronic copy of the Survey) which\nadversely affect the title to the Property and the same shall be deemed to be title defects which shall be dealt with within the\nsame Objection Period and in the same manner as the Purchaser’s objections to title (e.g., via a Notice of Title Objections or\nsupplemental Notice of Title Objections), as provided in Section 4.1 above. Any matters shown on the Survey which Purchaser\ndoes not timely object shall be deemed a Permitted Exception hereunder.\n5.0Control Of Property. If, prior to the Closing, the Property shall be the subject of (i) an action in eminent domain or a proposed taking by\na governmental authority, whether temporary or permanent (\"Taking\"), or (ii) a material casualty in which the cost of restoration exceeds\nfive percent (5%) of the Purchase Price (\"Casualty\"), Purchaser, at its sole election, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on\nwritten notice to Seller without liability on its part by so notifying Seller, and Earnest Money paid by Purchaser shall be refunded to\nPurchaser. If the Purchaser does not exercise its right of termination, any and all proceeds (including all insurance proceeds and any\ndeductible under Seller’s policy) arising out of any such Taking or Casualty shall be held in trust by Seller for Purchaser's benefit and shall\nbe credited against the Purchase Price. In no event shall the Purchase Price of the Property be increased by the amount of any such\nproceeds.\n6.0Representations and Warranties of Seller.

The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC in 2018 that owns 0.001% of the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Company places each property in a separate entity which may have a Redeemable Non-Controlling interest as a member.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis owned 27 properties.\n\nManagement’s Liquidity Plans and Going Concern\n\nOn August 27, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-05, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from financial statement issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In accordance with ASU 2014-05, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of $783,511 and had cash on hand of $1.58 million as of September 30, 2024. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. In August 2024 the Company modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in September 2024 and October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balances of the modified secured loans were $7.2 million and $4.4 million at 6.15% annual interest with maturity dates extended to August 2029. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon continued successful execution of management’s plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability.\n\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements is in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The Company adopted the calendar year as its basis of reporting. Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.\n\nConsolidation\n\n10\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Generation Income Properties, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and all of the direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company’s subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. The ownership interests of other investors in these entities are recorded as non-controlling interests or redeemable non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are adjusted each period for additional contributions, distributions, and the allocation of net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interests. Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not have financial or operating control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company’s share of the earnings (or losses) of these entities are included in consolidated net income or loss.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.\n\n11\n\nCash\n\nThe Company considers all demand deposits, cashier’s checks and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. Amounts included in restricted cash represent funds owned by the Company related to tenant escrow reimbursements and immediate capital repair reserve. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that sums to the total of those amounts at the end of the periods presented on the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: \n\nAs of September 30, | As of December 31,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 1,547,110 | $ | 3,117,446  \nRestricted cash | 34,500 | 34,500  \nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ | 1,581,610 | $ | 3,151,946  \n  \nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company leases real estate to its tenants under long-term net leases which the Company accounts for as operating leases. Those leases that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Deferred rent liability includes $176,393 and $280,332 of prepaid rent as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant’s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates, and economic conditions in the area where the property is located. In the event that uncollectibility exists with respect to any tenant changes, the Company would record an allowance with a corresponding reduction to Rental income. The Company’s review of collectability of charges under its operating leases includes any accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line rents. There were no allowances for receivables recorded during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n\nThe Company’s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance (“CAM”), insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses (“recoverable costs”). A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued.\n\nThe Company often recognizes above- and below-market lease intangibles in connection with acquisitions of real estate. The capitalized above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental income over theremaining term of the related leases.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company records all equity-based incentive grants to employees and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors in compensation costs based on their fair values on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the outstanding equity awards.\n\nInvestments in Real Estate\n\nAcquisitions of real estate are recorded at cost. The Company assigns the purchase price of real estate to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair value. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, site improvements, and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the value of in-place leases and above- or below-market leases assumed with the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, the Company assesses whether the purchase of the real estate falls within the definition of a business under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, and to date has concluded that all asset transactions have been asset acquisitions. Therefore, each acquisition has been recorded at the purchase price whereas assets and liabilities, inclusive of closing costs, are allocated to land, building, site improvements, tenant improvements, and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.\n\nThe fair value of the in-place leases are estimated as the cost to replace the leases including loss of rent, commissions and legal fees. The in-place leases are amortized over the remaining term of the leases as amortization expense. The fair value of an above- or below-market lease is estimated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the estimated current market lease rate expected over the remaining non-cancelable life of the lease. The capitalized above- or below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase to rental income over the remaining term of the lease inclusive of the renewal option periods that are considered probable at acquisition.\n\nDepreciation Expense\n\nReal estate and related assets are stated net of accumulated depreciation. Renovations, replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\n\n12\n\nestimated useful life of the buildings, which are generally between 15 and 50 years, and site improvements, which are generally 5 to 9 years. Tenant improvements are amortized over the lease terms of the tenants, which is generally between 2 and 10 years, with two tenant improvements amortized over 27 years.\n\nLease Liabilities\n\nThe Company has a certain property within its portfolio that is on land subject to a ground lease with a third party, which is classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold in this property. The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as investment in real estate and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\n\nUnder ASC 842, Leases, the Company recognizes a lease liability for its ground lease and corresponding right-of-use asset related to this same ground lease which is classified as an operating lease. A key input in estimating the lease liability and resulting right-of-use asset is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rate implicit in the contract is not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground lease, including mortgage market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and the payment terms present in the lease. This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for the lease to measure the lease liability.\n\nImpairments\n\nThe Company reviews investments in real estate and related lease intangibles for possible impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable though operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Events or changes in circumstances that may occur include, but are not limited to, significant changes in real estate market conditions, estimated residual values, and an expectation to sell assets before the end of the previously estimated life. Impairments are measured to the extent the current book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less disposition costs for any assets classified as held for sale. An impairment loss of approximately $1.06 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 resulting from the reduction in the anticipated holding period of the property which was reclassified as held for sale in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and remains classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. There were no impairments in the Company's investments in real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, and purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. The Company may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results.\n\nReal Estate Held for Sale\n\nThe Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when certain criteria have been met, and management believes it is probable that the disposition will occur within one year. Properties are held for sale for a period longer than one year if events or circumstances out of the Company's control occur that delay the sale and while management continues to be committed to the plan of sale and is performing actions necessary to respond to the conditions causing the delay the properties held for sale remain salable in their current condition. Assets that are classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell, and depreciation and amortization are no longer recognized. Held for sale properties are evaluated quarterly to ensure that properties continue to meet the held for sale criteria. If properties are required to be reclassified from held for sale to held for use due to changes to a plan of sale, they are recorded at the lower of fair value or the carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used. Properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria are accounted for as operating properties.\n\nThe Company executed a contract to sell the property located at 15091 SW Alabama, Huntsville, AL for $6.15 million in September 2024, As of the reporting date, the transaction has not consummated in a sale and the Company is actively engaged in discussions with other potential buyers. As such, the Company has reclassified the asset to Held for sale assets net of the costs of sales at a carrying value of approximately $5.75 million and recorded an impairment loss of approximately $1.06 million.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under Section 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying\n\n13\n\nconsolidated financial statements relates to the Company's consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary of which no income was generated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe Company also recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is not more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained on examination, including resolution of the related processes, if any. As of each balance sheet date, unrecognized benefits are reassessed and adjusted if the Company’s judgment changes as a result of new information. No liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of September 30, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company's tax returns for the years 2020 forward remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.\n\nEarnings per Share\n\nIn accordance with ASC 260, Earning Per Share, basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss attributable to the Company that is available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock warrants, using the treasury stock method, and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive securities such as warrants and convertible membership units of the Operating Partnership (“GIP LP Units”) if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all potentially dilutive securities were excluded because the effect was anti-dilutive.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values of our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to estimates that may change in the future.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n\n•\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. \n\n•\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. \n\n•\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. The Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs. See Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 10 for additional information on the Company's fair value measurements.\n\nNote 3 – Acquired Lease Intangible Assets, net\n\nIn-place leases, net is comprised of the following:\n\nAs of September 30, | As of December 31,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \nIn-place leases | $ | 8,844,500 | $ | 8,914,075  \nAccumulated amortization | (2,857,652 | ) | (2,411,802 | )  \nIn-place leases, net | $ | 5,986,848 | $ | 6,502,273  \n  \n14\n\nThe amortization for in-place leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $346,404 and $359,010, and 1,090,135 and 630,312, respectively.

The Company's rental income is comprised of both fixed and variable income. Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per the lease contract, which are primarily related to base rent. The Company’s leases also provide for reimbursement from recoverable costs. A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued. Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-line basis. Variable lease income includes the tenants' contractual obligations to reimburse the Company for their portion of recoverable costs incurred and index based rent adjustments. The following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized as either fixed or variable lease income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nRental income  \nFixed and in-substance fixed lease income | $ | 5,934,480 | $ | 3,784,640  \nVariable lease income | 1,045,265 | 575,078  \nOther related lease income, net:  \nAmortization of above- and below-market leases, net | (203,906 | ) | 81,408  \nStraight line rent revenue | 74,253 | 45,375  \nTotal rental income | $ | 6,850,092 | $ | 4,486,501  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following tenants each accounted for more than 10% of our rental revenue as indicated below:\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nGeneral Services Administration - Norfolk, VA, Manteo, NC & Vacaville, CA | 12 | % | 23 | %  \nPre-K - San Antonio, TX | 11 | % | N/A  \nDollar General | 11 | % | N/A  \nKohl's Corporation | 10 | % | 14 | %  \nexp U.S. services | 10 | % | N/A  \nPRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA | 9 | % | 13 | %  \nPratt & Whitney Automation, Inc. - Huntsville, AL | N/A | 12 | %  \n  \n16\n\nThe following table presents future minimum rental cash payments due to the Company over the next five calendar years and thereafter as of December 31:\n\nAs of September 30,  \n---  \n2024  \n2024 (3 months remaining) | $ | 2,155,664  \n2025 | 8,535,343  \n2026 | 8,251,393  \n2027 | 6,227,716  \n2028 | 4,547,697  \nThereafter | 18,645,714  \n$ | 48,363,527  \n  \nOn March 29, 2024, the Company executed a 10-year lease, with two five-year renewal options, with Armed Services YMCA for the use of approximately 35,000 square feet of the property located at 2510 Walmer Avenue, Norfolk, Virginia. Rent commenced on May 1, 2024 under the contracted twelve month tenant improvement period at a reduced fixed base rent of approximately $23,000 per month. Base rent increases to a fixed rate of approximately $34,000 per month in month 13 and escalates annually at approximately 2.5%.\n\nOn August 29, 2024, the Company acquired a 30,465 square foot retail property in Ames, Iowa for $5.5 million occupied by Best Buy with a remaining lease of approximately 6 years at an annual base rent of $405,470. Future minimum rent reflected in the above table, accordingly.\n\nLessee Accounting\n\nThe Company acquired one property on March 9, 2022 that is subject to a non-cancelable, long-term ground lease where a third party owns the underlying land and has leased the land to the Company. Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold in this property. This ground lease expires in 2084 including those options the Company deems probable of exercising. The ground lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, including management's estimate of expected option renewal periods. Operating lease expense was approximately $93,762 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and $281,285 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There are no variable lease expenses required to be paid by the Company as lessee per the lease terms. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of the lease liability, net was $61,278 and $58,175 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $182,799 and $174,525 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe following table summarizes the undiscounted future cash flows for subsequent years ending December 31 attributable to the lease liability as of September 30, 2024 and provides a reconciliation to the lease liability included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30,  \n---  \n2024  \n2024 (3 months remaining) | 61,019  \n2025 | 245,111  \n2026 | 245,111  \n2027 | 245,111  \n2028 | 245,111  \nThereafter | 21,575,533  \nTotal undiscounted liability | $ | 22,616,996  \nPresent value discount | (16,164,772 | )  \nLease liability | $ | 6,452,224  \nDiscount rate | 4.58 | %  \nTerm Remaining | 60 years  \n  \nNote 6 – Non-Controlling Interests\n\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interests (Temporary Equity)\n\nOperating Unit Holders\n\nLMB Owenton I LLC\n\n17\n\nAs part of the Company’s acquisition of one property on January 14, 2022 for approximately $2,264,000 in Tampa, FL, the Operating Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with LMB Owenton I LLC that resulted in the issuance of 110,957 GIP LP Units at $10.00 per share for a total value of $1,109,570. After 24 months, the contribution agreement allows for the investor to require the Operating Partnership to redeem, all or a portion of its units for either (i) the Redemption Amount (within the meaning of the Partnership Agreement), or (ii) until forty nine (49) months from date of closing, cash in an agreed-upon Value (within the meaning of the Partnership Agreement) of $10.00 per share. As such, the Company has determined this equity should be classified as temporary equity at redemption value. On February 7, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into a Unit Issuance Agreement and Amendment to Contribution and Subscription Agreement with LMB Owenton I LLC in which the Operating Partnership and LMB Owenton I LLC agreed to delay the Contributor’s right to require the redemption of the Contributor’s GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership until after 36 months on January 14, 2025 and for a reduced redemption price of $7.15 per GIP LP Unit. Such agreement was made in consideration of the issuance to LMB Owenton I LLC of an additional 44,228 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership, resulting in Contributor owning an aggregate of 155,185 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at redemption value of $1,109,570 as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNorfolk, VA Partnership\n\nAs part of the Company’s acquisition of two properties for approximately $19,134,400 on September 30, 2019 in Norfolk, Virginia, the \"Norfolk, Virginia properties\", the Operating Partnership entered into contribution agreements with two entities (Greenwal, L.C. and Riverside Crossing, L.C.) that resulted in the issuance of 349,913 common units in the Operating Partnership at $20.00 per share for a total value of $6,998,251. Greenwal, L.C and Riverside Crossing, L.C. have since been dissolved and the common units were then directly owned by the former members of the two entities. Beginning on the first anniversary of the closing, the contribution agreements allowed for the two investors to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of its units for either (i) the Redemption Amount (within the meaning of the Operating Partnership’s Partnership Agreement), or (ii) until forty-nine (49) months from date of closing, cash in an agreed-upon Value (within the meaning of the Operating Partnership’s Partnership Agreement) of $20.00 per share, as set forth on the Notice of Redemption. As such, the Company has determined their equity should be classified as a temporary equity at redemption value. On March 21, 2022, the Company received notice from an Operating Partnership common unit holder to redeem 10,166 units at $20.00 per unit for a total of $203,326 and paid the unit holder on June 24, 2022. On April 25, 2022, the Company received notice from another Operating Partnership common unit holder to redeem 10,166 units at $20 per unit for a total of $203,326 and paid the unit holder on July 25, 2022. On July 20, 2022, the Company received a notice of redemption from an Operating Partnership common unit holder exercising his right to redeem 25,000 units at $20 per unit and such notice further stated the unit holder’s intent to redeem his remaining 180,615 units in the Operating Partnership before October 31, 2023. On August 9, 2022, the Company and Operating Partnership entered a Redemption Agreement with the unit holder providing for the revocation of his July 2022 redemption notice and providing that the his common units in the Operating Partnership would be redeemed by the Operating Partnership as follows: (i) on or before September 15, 2022, 16,250 of the units would be redeemed for an aggregate of $325,000 in cash (which is $20 per unit, as provided in the applicable Contribution Agreements) and 60,000 of the units would be redeemed in exchange for the issuance of 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) the remaining 129,365 units would be redeemed for $20 per unit in cash in one tranche of 16,250 units on March 15, 2023 and five tranches of 22,623 units each on September 15, 2023, March 15, 2024, June 15, 2024, September 15, 2024, and December 15, 2024. As such, the Company recorded an other payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution of the Redemption Agreement entered into August 9, 2022 and continue to pay unit distributions on current units outstanding. In accordance with the Redemption Agreement the Company has made payments of $2,459,840 to date, reducing the current balance of the other payable - related party to $452,460 as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, on September 12, 2022, the Company issued 200,000 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share in accordance with the Redemption Agreement. On January 27, 2023, the remaining two partners from this original transaction redeemed a total of 123,965 units at $20 per unit in the aggregate amount of $2,479,299 and the Company funded the redemption obligations per the terms of the contribution agreement on February 9, 2023 using proceeds from new preferred equity agreements with Brown Family Enterprises, LLC. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued approximately $506,000 relating to the potential reimbursement of federal, state and local income taxes incurred by a remaining partner in one of our partnerships pursuant to tax protection agreement and is included in Accrued Expense - Related Party on the face of the balance sheet and the balance remained unchanged as of September 30, 2024.\n\nPreferred Equity Partners\n\nBrown Family Trust and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC\n\nAs part of the Company’s acquisition of a property for approximately $1,737,800 in Manteo, NC, one of the Company’s operating subsidiaries entered into a preferred equity agreement with Brown Family Trust on February 11, 2021 pursuant to which the Company’s subsidiary received a capital contribution of $500,000.

The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of $1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest in GIP SPE (the “Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in the amount of 5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is less than 10%, in which case the balance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.\n\n19\n\nThe Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the LC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount. Upon a failure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at an increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month extension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is increased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’ senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period, and there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.\n\nUnder the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having been paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.\n\nDue to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of $2,280,471 as of September 30, 2024.\n\nEach of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the discretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the Operating Partnership (\"GIP LP Units\"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the Operating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such preferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units shall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition.\n\nNon-Controlling Interest (Permanent Equity)\n\nAs part of the Company’s acquisition of one property on November 30, 2020 for $1,847,700 in Tampa, FL, the Operating Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with GIP Fund 1, LLC that resulted in the issuance of 24,309 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at $20.00 per share for a total value of $486,180. At the time of the acquisition, the Company’s President owned 11% of GIP Fund 1. GIP Fund 1 has since been dissolved and the GIP Units are now directly owned by the former members of GIP Fund 1. After 12 months, the contribution agreement allows for the former members of GIP Fund 1 to require the Operating Partnership to redeem, all or a portion of its GIP LP Units for common stock of the Company. As such, the Company has determined their equity should be classified as a Non-controlling interest.\n\nFollowing these transactions as of September 30, 2024, the Company owned 95.3% of the common units in the Operating Partnership and outside investors owned 4.7%. The following table reflects the Company's redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interest during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: \n\n20\n\nBrown Family Trust and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC | Irby Prop Partners | Richard Hornstrom | LMB Owenton I LLC | GIP LP (Former Greenwal, L.C. and Riverside Crossing, L.C.

Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Units, the investor will be paid cumulative cash distributions in the amount of $0.325 per Series A Preferred Unit per year, payable monthly in arrears, on or about the 15th day of each month. Each of the investor and the Operating Partnership will have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred Units after two (2) years for cash in an amount equal to $5.15 per Series A Preferred Unit plus any accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Return, provided that the Operating Partnership may (with the prior written consent of the investor) cause the redemption price to be satisfied by the issuance of a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the number of Series A Preferred Units being redeemed multiplied by 1.03 plus any accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Return. If the Operating Partnership fails to declare and pay the Series A Preferred Return for a period of three consecutive months, the investor may exercise the foregoing redemption right within the 30-day period following such failure.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, the Operating Partnership of Generation Income Properties, Inc.

As used in this Quarterly Report, an affiliate, or person affiliated with a specified person, is a person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are an internally managed, Maryland corporation focused on acquiring retail, office and industrial real estate located in major U.S. markets. We initiated operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by, and operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership’s direct and indirect subsidiaries. The\n\n29\n\nCompany is the general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of September 30, 2024 owned 95.3% of the outstanding common units of the Operating Partnership. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC in 2018 that owns 0.001% of the Operating Partnership.\n\nPublic Offering and Nasdaq Listing\n\nIn September 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 1,665,000 units at a price to the public of $10 per unit generating net proceeds of $13.8 million including issuance costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price equal to $10 per share. The common stock and warrants included in the units (which were separated into one share of common stock and one warrant) currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “GIPR” and “GIPRW,” respectively.\n\nOur Investments\n\nThe following are characteristics of our properties as of September 30, 2024:\n\n•\n\nCreditworthy Tenants. Approximately 60% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent (\"ABR\") as of September 30, 2024 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of “BBB-” or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, EXP Services, and Kohl’s Corporation, PRA Holdings, and City of San Antonio contributed approximately 69% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent. \n\n•\n\n% Leased. Our portfolio is 89% leased and occupied. \n\n•\n\nContractual Rent Growth. Approximately 92% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on ABR as of September 30, 2024) provide for increases in contractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods. \n\n•\n\nAverage Effective Annual Rental per Square Foot. Average effective annual rental per square foot is $14.75. \n\nGiven the nature of our leases, our tenants either pay the realty taxes directly or reimburse us for such costs. We believe all of our properties are adequately covered by insurance.\n\nThe table below presents an overview of the properties in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024:\n\n30\n\nProperty Type | Location | Rentable Square Feet | Tenant | S&P Credit Rating (1) | IG | Remaining Term (Yrs) | Options (Number x Yrs) | Contractual Rent Escalations (5) | ABR (2) | ABR per Sq.

New lease executed for the vacant unit, effective May 1, 2024.\n\nDistributions\n\nFrom inception through September 30, 2024, we have distributed $5,031,549 to common stockholders. On July 3, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors determined to suspend the Company’s regular dividend, commencing with the monthly dividends that would have been paid in July 2024.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn July 3, 2024 we announced that our Board of Directors had voted to suspend the Company's dividend for shareholder of record of our common stock.\n\nOn July 19, 2024, we determined that MaloneBailey LLP (“MaloneBailey”) would no longer serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and would be dismissed effective as of July 19, 2024. The decision to change independent registered public accounting firms was approved by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Company on July 19, 2024.\n\n31\n\nOn July 19, 2024, we ratified the appointment of CohnReznick LLP (“CohnReznick”) as its new independent registered public accounting firm to audit and review the Company’s financial statements.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, the Operating Partnership of Generation Income Properties, Inc. (the “Company”), entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership (the “LPA Amendment”), pursuant to which the Company, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, issued partnership interests to LMB Owenton I LLC (“Contributor”) in the form of Series B-1 Preferred Units (the “Series B-1 Preferred Units”).\n\nAlso on July 24, 2024, the Operating Partnership and the Contributor entered into a Contribution and Exchange Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the Contributor contributed 155,185 Common Units in exchange for 155,185 Series B-1 Preferred Units. If and when determined by the Company, as general partner of the Operating Partnership, in its sole discretion, holders of the Series B-1 Preferred Units will be paid cash distributions in the amount of $0.117 per Series B-1 Preferred Unit per quarter, subject to prior payment of any preferred return on senior preferred units of the Operating Partnership. The Contributor will have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the Series B-1 Preferred Units after two (2) years for either (i) cash in an amount equal to $7.15 per Series B-1 Preferred Unit or (ii) a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the number of Series B-1 Preferred Units being redeemed multiplied by 1.00, plus, in each case, an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon.\n\nOn July 25, 2024, the Operating Partnership entered into First Amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreements, dated as of February 8, 2023, for each of the Norfolk, Virginia properties, GIPVA 2510 Walmer Ave, LLC and GIPVA 130 Corporate Blvd, LLC to revise the redemption date of Brown Family Enterprises, LLC membership interests from February 8, 2025 to February 8, 2027.\n\nOn August 29, 2024, we acquired a 30,465 square foot retail property in Ames, Iowa for $5.5 million occupied by Best Buy with a remaining lease of approximately 6 years at an annual base rent of $405,470. Future minimum rent reflected in the above table, accordingly.\n\nWe modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in September 2024 and October 2024. As of September 30, 2024 the principal balances of the modified secured loans were $7.2 million and $4.4 million at 6.15% annual interest with maturity dates extended to August 2029.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nOperating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023:\n\nRevenue\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue from operations were 2,400,282 and $7,092,690, respectively, as compared to $1,844,148 and 4,510,065 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue increased by $556,134 and $2,582,625 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall revenue increase was driven by the integration of the 13 property portfolio acquired from Modiv in August 2023.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred total operating expenses of $3,769,715 and $11,133,386 respectively, as compared to $3,060,715 and $7,082,645, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses increased overall by $709,578 and $4,050,740, respectively, as follows:\n\nThree months ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023 | Change  \nGeneral and administrative expense | $ | 577,565 | $ | 530,538 | $ | 47,027  \nBuilding expenses | 729,062 | 431,359 | 297,703  \nDepreciation and amortization | 1,068,081 | 981,419 | 86,662  \nInterest expense, net | 1,098,608 | 770,624 | 327,984  \nCompensation costs | 296,399 | 346,196 | (49,797 | )  \nTotal expenses | $ | 3,769,715 | $ | 3,060,136 | $ | 709,579  \n  \n32\n\nNine months ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023 | Change  \nGeneral, administrative and organizational costs | $ | 1,632,018 | $ | 1,233,674 | $ | 398,344  \nBuilding expenses | 2,067,356 | 1,065,214 | 1,002,142  \nDepreciation and amortization | 3,474,918 | 2,096,970 | 1,377,948  \nInterest expense, net | 3,142,489 | 1,706,585 | 1,435,904  \nCompensation costs | 816,605 | 980,202 | (163,597 | )  \nTotal expenses | $ | 11,133,386 | $ | 7,082,645 | $ | 4,050,741  \n  \n•\n\nGeneral, administrative and organizational costs increased by $47,027 and $398,344 driven by an increase in accounting, audit and tax fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\n•\n\nBuilding expenses increased by $297,703 and $1,002,142 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to an overall increase driven by the integration of the acquired 13 property portfolio from Modiv in August 2023, compared to the portfolio in operation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n•\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $86,662 and $1,377,948 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by the integration of the since acquired 13 property portfolio from Modiv compared with the portfolio in operation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n•\n\nInterest expense, net increased by $327,984 and $1,435,904 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to Company's borrowing of approximately $21 million of mortgage debt secured by the acquired 13 property portfolio. An additional incremental increase is the result of the guaranty fee expense to the Company's CEO of $96,652 and $304,245 incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\n•\n\nCompensation costs decreased by $49,798 and $163,598, respectively, primarily due to savings in salary expense and for accounting and administrative staff.\n\nNet loss\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated a net loss of $2,103,549 and $1,213,265 and $5,444,133 and 3,156,015, respectively.\n\nOther expense\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued $0 and $506,000 relating to the potential reimbursement of federal, state and local income taxes incurred by a remaining partner in one of our partnerships pursuant to a tax protection agreement.\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $866,047 and $425,637 and $2,612,405 and $681,916, respectively. The variance is attributable to additional redeemable non-controlling interests established during the second half of fiscal year 2023 to facilitate acquisitions, namely the acquisition of the 13 property Modiv portfolio in August 2023.\n\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated a net loss attributable to our shareholders of $2,969,596 and $1,828,902 and $8,151,537 and 4,027,931, respectively.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe require capital to fund our investment activities and operating expenses. Our capital sources may include net proceeds from offerings of our equity securities, cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash (unrestricted and restricted) of $1,581,610, properties with a gross cost basis of $102,307,436 and outstanding mortgage loans with a principal balance of $59,707,772, excluding assets held for sale for $5.75 million.\n\nIn September 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,665,000 units at a price to the public of $10 per unit generating net proceeds of $13.8 million including issuance costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nOn April 1, 2022, we entered into two mortgage loan agreements with an aggregate balance of $13.5 million to refinance seven of our properties. The loan agreements consist of one loan in the amount of $11.4 million secured by six properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value, and one loan in the amount of $2.1 million on the property previously held in the tenancy-in-common investment at an interest rate of 3.85% from April 1, 2022 through and until March 31, 2027. In conjunction with\n\n33\n\nthe LC2 Investment to purchase the remaining interest in the tenancy-in-common interest discussed above, the Company assumed the original $2.1 million loan on the property with a remaining balance of $2,079,178 and recognized a discount of $383,767. Effective April 1, 2027 and through the maturity date of March 31, 2032, the interest rate adjusts to the 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and is subject to a floor of 3.85%. Our CEO entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment obligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-boy” provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership.\n\nOn August 10, 2023, GIP13, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GIP SPE (\"GIP Borrower\"), entered into a Loan Agreement with Valley pursuant to which Valley made a loan to the Company in the amount of $21.0 million to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The outstanding principal amount of the loan bears interest at an annual rate for each 30-day interest period equal to the compounded average of the secured overnight financing rate published by Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the thirty-day period prior to the last day of each 30-day interest rate for the applicable interest rate period plus 3.25%, with interest payable monthly after each 30-day interest period. However, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47% per annum. Payments of interest and principal in the amount of approximately $156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date of August 10, 2028. The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid financing fees. The loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP SPE that had outstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the subsidiaries of the Company that hold the properties that comprise the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement also provides for customary events of default and other customary affirmative and negative covenants that are applicable to GIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, including reporting covenants and restrictions on investments, additional indebtedness, liens, sales of properties, certain mergers, and certain management changes. The Company's President and CEO also entered into a personal, full recourse guarantee with a $7,500,000 cap.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, the Operating Partnership and an accredited investor entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the “June 2024 Unit Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Operating Partnership issued and sold to the investor 500,000 Series A Preferred Units at a price of $5.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) in cash. Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Units, the investor will be paid cumulative cash distributions in the amount of $0.325 per Series A Preferred Unit per year, payable monthly in arrears, on or about the 15th day of each month. Each of the investor and the Operating Partnership will have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred Units after two (2) years for cash in an amount equal to $5.15 per Series A Preferred Unit plus any accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Return, provided that the Operating Partnership may (with the prior written consent of the investor) cause the redemption price to be satisfied by the issuance of a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the number of Series A Preferred Units being redeemed multiplied by 1.03 plus any accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Return. If the Operating Partnership fails to declare and pay the Series A Preferred Return for a period of three consecutive months, the investor may exercise the foregoing redemption right within the 30-day period following such failure.\n\nOur President and CEO has also personally guaranteed the repayment of the $10.6 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks - South Tampa, FL; and vacant - Huntsville, AL loan as well as the $1.3 million loan secured by the Company's Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL property. In addition, our President and CEO has also provided a guaranty of the Company’s nonrecourse carveout liabilities and obligations in favor of the lender for the GSA and PRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA mortgage loans (\"Bayport loans\") with an aggregate principal amount of $11.6 million.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a guaranty fee expense to our President and CEO of $102,023 and $304,245, respectively, recorded to interest expense. A guaranty fee expense of $81,022 and $196,304 was incurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered a Redemption Agreement with a unit holder. As such, we recorded another payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution of the Redemption Agreement entered into July 20, 2022 and has since made installment payments of $2,007,380 to date with a remaining balance of $904,920 outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nOn October 14, 2022, we entered into a loan transaction that is evidenced by a secured non-convertible promissory note to Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, a preferred equity partner and therefore a related party, for $1.5 million that is due on October 14, 2024, and bears a fixed interest rate of 9% with simple interest payable monthly. On July 21, 2023, the Company amended and restated the promissory note to reflect an increase in the loan to $5.5 million and extend the maturity date thereof from October 14, 2024 to October 14, 2026. Except for the increase in the amount of the Loan and Note and the extension of the maturity date thereof, no changes were made to the original note. The loan may be repaid without penalty at any time. The loan is secured by the Operating Partnership’s equity interest in its current direct subsidiaries that hold real estate assets pursuant to the terms of a security agreement between the Operating Partnership and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC.\n\n34\n\nWe currently obtain the capital required to primarily invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial net lease real estate investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of equity offerings, debt financings, preferred minority interest obtained from third parties, issuance of Operating Partnership units and from any undistributed funds from our operations.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of $783,511 and had cash on hand of $1.58 million as of September 30, 2024. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. In August 2024 the Company modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in September 2024 and October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balances of the modified secured loans were $7.2 million and $4.4 million at 6.15% annual interest with maturity dates extended to August 2029. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon continued successful execution of management’s plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability.\n\n35\n\nOutstanding mortgage loans payable consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\n\nOccupying Tenant | Location | Original Loan Amount | Interest Rate | Maturity Date | 9/30/2024 | 12/31/2023 | Debt Service Coverage Ratios (\"DSCR\") Required  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n7-Eleven Corporation & Starbucks Corporation | Washington, D.C., Tampa, FL, and Huntsville, AL | $ | 11,287,500 |  (a) | 4.17% | 3/6/2030 | $ | 10,619,578 | $ | 10,757,239 | 1.25  \nGeneral Services Administration-Navy & AYMCA | Norfolk, VA | 8,260,000 | (f) | 6.15% | 8/30/2029 | 7,165,788 | 7,341,804 | 1.25  \nPRA Holdings, Inc. | Norfolk, VA | 5,216,749 |  (f) | 6.15% | 8/23/2029 | 4,439,827 | 4,562,722 | 1.25  \nSherwin Williams Company | Tampa, FL | 1,286,664 | 3.72% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 1,263,111 | 1,286,664 | 1.20  \nGeneral Services Administration-FBI | Manteo, NC | 928,728 |  (c) | 3.85% |  (d) | 3/31/2032 | 896,924 | 913,958 | 1.50  \nIrby Construction | Plant City , FL | 928,728 | (c) | 3.85% | (d) | 3/31/2032 | 896,924 | 913,958 | 1.50  \nLa-Z-Boy Inc. | Rockford, IL | 2,100,000 | 3.85% |  (d) | 3/31/2032 | 2,028,087 | 2,066,604 | 1.50  \nBest Buy Co., Inc. | Grand Junction, CO | 2,552,644 | (c) | 3.85% | (d) | 3/31/2032 | 2,465,231 | 2,512,050 | 1.50  \nFresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. | Chicago, IL | 1,727,108 |  (c) | 3.85% |  (d) | 3/31/2032 | 1,667,965 | 1,699,642 | 1.50  \nStarbucks Corporation | Tampa, FL | 1,298,047 | (c) | 3.85% | (d) | 3/31/2032 | 1,253,596 | 1,277,404 | 1.50  \nKohl's Corporation | Tucson, AZ | 3,964,745 |  (c) | 3.85% |  (d) | 3/31/2032 | 3,828,975 | 3,901,694 | 1.50  \nCity of San Antonio (PreK) | San Antonio, TX | 6,444,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 6,347,784 | 6,416,362 | 1.50  \nDollar General Market | Bakersfield, CA | 2,428,000 |  (e) | 7.47% |  (b) | 8/10/2028 | 2,391,747 | 2,417,587 | 1.50  \nDollar General | Big Spring, TX | 635,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 625,519 | 632,277 | 1.50  \nDollar General | Castalia, OH | 556,000 |  (e) | 7.47% |  (b) | 8/10/2028 | 547,698 | 553,615 | 1.50  \nDollar General | East Wilton, ME | 726,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 715,160 | 722,886 | 1.50  \nDollar General | Lakeside, OH | 567,000 |  (e) | 7.47% |  (b) | 8/10/2028 | 558,534 | 564,568 | 1.50  \nDollar General | Litchfield, ME | 624,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 614,683 | 621,324 | 1.50  \nDollar General | Mount Gilead, OH | 533,000 |  (e) | 7.47% |  (b) | 8/10/2028 | 525,042 | 530,714 | 1.50  \nDollar General | Thompsontown, PA | 556,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 547,698 | 553,615 | 1.50  \nDollar Tree Stores, Inc. | Morrow, GA | 647,000 |  (e) | 7.47% |  (b) | 8/10/2028 | 637,340 | 644,225 | 1.50  \nexp U.S. Services Inc. | Maitland, FL | 2,950,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 2,905,953 | 2,937,348 | 1.50  \nGeneral Services Administration | Vacaville, CA | 1,293,000 |  (e) | 7.47% |  (b) | 8/10/2028 | 1,273,694 | 1,287,454 | 1.50  \nWalgreens | Santa Maria, CA | 3,041,000 | (e) | 7.47% | (b) | 8/10/2028 | 2,995,594 | 3,027,958 | 1.50  \nBest Buy Co., Inc. | Ames, IA | 2,495,000 | 6.29% |  (b) | 8/23/2029 | 2,495,000 | n/a | 1.50  \n63,045,913 | 59,707,452 | 58,143,672  \nLess Debt Discount, net | (328,943 | ) | (383,767 | )  \nLess Debt Issuance Costs, net | (827,677 | ) | (942,595 | )  \n58,550,832 | 56,817,310  \n  \n(a) Loan subject to prepayment penalty\n\n(b) Fixed via interest rate swap\n\n(c) One loan in the amount of $11.4 million secured by six properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value.\n\n36\n\n(d) Adjustment effective April 1, 2027 equal to 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and subject to a floor of 3.85%\n\n(e)One loan in the amount of $21.0 million secured by 13 properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value.\n\n(f) Debt has been modified to mature in August 2029\n\nWe amortized debt issuance costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 to interest expense of approximately $60,532 and $46,260 and $156,091 and $103,990, respectively.

GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130 (the “Virginia SPEs”) hold our Norfolk, Virginia properties. In addition, both of the Virginia SPEs and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC entered into Unit Purchase Agreements in which GIPVA 2510 issued and sold 180,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of $10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of $1,800,000, and GIPVA 130 issued and sold 120,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of $10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of $1,200,000. The Operating Partnership is the general manager of the subsidiary while Brown Family Enterprises, LLC is a preferred equity member. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay the preferred equity member a 7% IRR paid on a monthly basis and will share in 16% of the equity in each of the Virginia SPEs upon a capital transaction resulting in distributable proceeds. After 24 months, Brown Family Enterprises, LLC has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value. On July 25, 2024, we entered into First Amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreements, dated as of February 8, 2023, for each of these entities revising the redemption date from February 8, 2025 to February 8, 2027. Because of the redemption right, the non-controlling interest is presented as temporary equity at an aggregated redemption value of $3,000,000 as of September 30, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio, the Operating Partnership and LC2 entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for GIP SPE (the “GIP SPE Operating Agreement”) pursuant to which LC2 made a $12.0 million initial capital contribution to GIP SPE, together with a commitment to make an additional $2.1 million contribution upon the satisfactory completion of the acquisition of a tenant-in-common interest held by a third party in the Company’s Rockford, Illinois property (the “LC2 Investment”). The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of $1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest in GIP SPE (the “Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in the amount of 5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is less than 10%, in which case the balance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the LC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount. Upon a\n\n37\n\nfailure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at an increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month extension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is increased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’ senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period, and there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.\n\nUnder the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having been paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.\n\nDue to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of $2,280,471 as of September 30, 2024.\n\nEach of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the discretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the Operating Partnership (\"GIP LP Units\"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the Operating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such preferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units shall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition.\n\nThe primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility using retained cash flows, long-term debt and common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth. We intend to have a lower-leveraged portfolio over the long-term after we have acquired an initial substantial portfolio of diversified investments. During the period when we are acquiring our current portfolio, we will employ greater leverage on individual assets (that will also result in greater leverage of the current portfolio) in order to quickly build a diversified portfolio of assets.\n\nCash from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $783,511 and net cash provided by operating activities was $18,537 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to the doubling of the number of the Company's income generating assets through the 13 property Modiv acquisition.\n\nCash from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $5,960,893. Net cash used in investing activities was $33,314,973 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to an escrow deposit for a property purchase.\n\nCash from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3,607,045 and $33,916,112 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to several factors comprising the increase of mortgage principal repayments driven by the Modiv acquisition in August 2023, the increase in distributions to non-controlling interests, and dividend payments on both preferred and common stock.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n38\n\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.\n\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude, net gains from sales of property and adding back real estate depreciation; namely, excluding from net income depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by an entity. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\n\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\n\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and non-recurring or extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\n39\n\nThe following tables reconcile net income (net loss), which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and Core AFFO:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet loss | $ | (2,103,549 | ) | $ | (1,213,265 | ) | $ | (5,444,133 | ) | $ | (3,156,015 | )  \nOther expense | - | 639 | - | 506,639  \nLoss on derivative valuation | 734,116 | - | 308,570 | -  \nDepreciation and amortization | 1,068,081 | 981,419 | 3,474,918 | 2,096,970  \nLoss on held for sale asset valuation | - | - | 1,058,994 | -  \nFunds From Operations | $ | (301,352 | ) | $ | (231,207 | ) | $ | (601,651 | ) | $ | (552,406 | )  \nAmortization of debt issuance costs | 60,532 | 46,260 | 156,091 | 103,990  \nNon-cash stock compensation | 94,935 | 119,380 | 284,804 | 287,067  \nAdjustments to Funds From Operations | 155,467 | 165,640 | 440,895 | 391,057  \nCore Funds From Operations | $ | (145,885 | ) | $ | (65,567 | ) | $ | (160,756 | ) | $ | (161,349 | )  \nNet loss | $ | (2,103,549 | ) | $ | (1,213,265 | ) | $ | (5,444,133 | ) | $ | (3,156,015 | )  \nOther expense | - | 639 | - | 506,639  \nLoss on derivative valuation | 734,116 | - | 308,570 | -  \nDepreciation and amortization | 1,068,081 | 981,419 | 3,474,918 | 2,096,970  \nAmortization of debt issuance costs | 60,532 | 46,260 | 156,091 | 103,990  \nAbove and below-market lease amortization, net | 203,357 | 20,398 | 203,357 | (81,957 | )  \nStraight line rent, net | 42,972 | 20,942 | 74,253 | 61,383  \nAdjustments to net loss | $ | 2,109,058 | $ | 1,069,658 | $ | 4,217,189 | $ | 2,687,025  \nAdjusted Funds From Operations | $ | 5,509 | $ | (143,607 | ) | $ | (1,226,944 | ) | $ | (468,990 | )  \nDead deal expense | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 35,873 | $ | 109,569  \nNon-cash stock compensation | 94,935 | 119,380 | 284,804 | 287,067  \nAdjustments to Adjusted Funds From Operations | $ | 94,935 | $ | 119,380 | $ | 320,677 | $ | 396,636  \nCore Adjusted Funds From Operations | $ | 100,444 | $ | (24,227 | ) | $ | (906,267 | ) | $ | (72,354 | )  \n  \nThe table above presents FFO in accordance with the most current available NAREIT guidance and in alignment with current industry standards.

See our audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this item.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\n\n40\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n41\n\nPART II.

(the “Company”) was formed as a Maryland corporation on September 19, 2015. The Company is an internally managed real estate\ninvestment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail, office and industrial properties net leased to high quality tenants in major markets\nthroughout the United States.\nThe Company formed Generation Income Properties L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) in October 2015. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by, and operations\nare conducted through, the Operating Partnership or its direct or indirect subsidiaries. The Company is the general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of September\n30, 2024 owned 95.3% of the outstanding common units of the Operating Partnership. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC in 2018 that owns\n0.001% of the Operating Partnership.\nThe Company places each property in a separate entity which may have a Redeemable Non-Controlling interest as a member.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis owned 27 properties.\nManagement’s Liquidity Plans and Going Concern\nOn August 27, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-05, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess\na company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from financial statement issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In\naccordance with ASU 2014-05, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the\nissuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will\nalleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial\nStatements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of $783,511 and had cash on hand of $1.58 million as of September 30,\n2024. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. In August 2024 the Company modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in\nSeptember 2024 and October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balances of the modified secured loans were $7.2 million and $4.4 million at 6.15% annual\ninterest with maturity dates extended to August 2029. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon continued successful execution of\nmanagement’s plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the\nfinancial statements not misleading. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read\nin conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024. The results\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements is in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The Company adopted the calendar year as its basis of reporting. Certain\nimmaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.\nConsolidation\n10\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Generation Income Properties, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and all of the direct and\nindirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company’s subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been\neliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. The ownership interests of other investors in these\nentities are recorded as non-controlling interests or redeemable non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are adjusted each period for additional contributions,\ndistributions, and the allocation of net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interests. Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over, but does not have financial or operating control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company’s share of\nthe earnings (or losses) of these entities are included in consolidated net income or loss.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized\nin the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.\n11\nCash\nThe Company considers all demand deposits, cashier’s checks and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. Amounts included in restricted cash represent funds\nowned by the Company related to tenant escrow reimbursements and immediate capital repair reserve. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s cash\nand cash equivalents and restricted cash that sums to the total of those amounts at the end of the periods presented on the Company’s accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,547,110 $ 3,117,446\nRestricted cash 34,500 34,500\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,581,610 $ 3,151,946\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company leases real estate to its tenants under long-term net leases which the Company accounts for as operating leases. Those leases that have fixed and determinable\nrent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Deferred rent liability includes $176,393 and $280,332 of prepaid rent as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant’s\npayment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates, and economic conditions in the area where the\nproperty is located. In the event that uncollectibility exists with respect to any tenant changes, the Company would record an allowance with a corresponding reduction to\nRental income. The Company’s review of collectability of charges under its operating leases includes any accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line rents. There\nwere no allowances for receivables recorded during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nThe Company’s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance (“CAM”), insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses\n(“recoverable costs”). A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs\nare incurred and accrued.\nThe Company often recognizes above- and below-market lease intangibles in connection with acquisitions of real estate. The capitalized above- and below-market lease\nintangibles are amortized to rental income over the remaining term of the related leases.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records all equity-based incentive grants to employees and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors in compensation costs based on\ntheir fair values on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service\nperiod of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the outstanding equity awards.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nAcquisitions of real estate are recorded at cost. The Company assigns the purchase price of real estate to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair value.\nTangible assets consist of land, buildings, site improvements, and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the value of in-place leases and above- or\nbelow-market leases assumed with the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, the Company assesses whether the purchase of the real estate falls within the definition of a\nbusiness under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, and to date has concluded that all asset transactions have been asset acquisitions.\nTherefore, each acquisition has been recorded at the purchase price whereas assets and liabilities, inclusive of closing costs, are allocated to land, building, site\nimprovements, tenant improvements, and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.\nThe fair value of the in-place leases are estimated as the cost to replace the leases including loss of rent, commissions and legal fees. The in-place leases are amortized over\nthe remaining term of the leases as amortization expense. The fair value of an above- or below-market lease is estimated as the present value of the difference between the\ncontractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the estimated current market lease rate expected over the remaining non-cancelable life of the lease. The\ncapitalized above- or below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase to rental income over the remaining term of the lease inclusive of the renewal option\nperiods that are considered probable at acquisition.\nDepreciation Expense\nReal estate and related assets are stated net of accumulated depreciation. Renovations, replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of assets are\ncapitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is\ncomputed using the straight-line method over the\n12\nestimated useful life of the buildings, which are generally between 15 and 50 years, and site improvements, which are generally 5 to 9 years. Tenant improvements are\namortized over the lease terms of the tenants, which is generally between 2 and 10 years, with two tenant improvements amortized over 27 years.\nLease Liabilities\nThe Company has a certain property within its portfolio that is on land subject to a ground lease with a third party, which is classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, the\nCompany owns only a long-term leasehold in this property. The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as investment in real estate and\nare depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\nUnder ASC 842, Leases, the Company recognizes a lease liability for its ground lease and corresponding right-of-use asset related to this same ground lease which is\nclassified as an operating lease. A key input in estimating the lease liability and resulting right-of-use asset is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rate\nimplicit in the contract is not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground lease, including mortgage market-based interest rates that\ncorrespond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and the payment terms present in the lease. This discount rate is applied to the remaining\nunpaid minimum rental payments for the lease to measure the lease liability.\nImpairments\nThe Company reviews investments in real estate and related lease intangibles for possible impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable though operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Events or changes in circumstances that may occur include, but\nare not limited to, significant changes in real estate market conditions, estimated residual values, and an expectation to sell assets before the end of the previously estimated\nlife. Impairments are measured to the extent the current book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less disposition costs for any assets classified as held for\nsale. An impairment loss of approximately $1.06 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 resulting from the reduction in the anticipated\nholding period of the property which was reclassified as held for sale in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and remains classified as held for sale as of September 30,\n2024. There were no impairments in the Company's investments in real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, and\npurchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. The Company may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as\nappropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results.\nReal Estate Held for Sale\nThe Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when certain criteria have been met, and management believes it is probable that the disposition will occur\nwithin one year. Properties are held for sale for a period longer than one year if events or circumstances out of the Company's control occur that delay the sale and while\nmanagement continues to be committed to the plan of sale and is performing actions necessary to respond to the conditions causing the delay the properties held for sale\nremain salable in their current condition. Assets that are classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell, and\ndepreciation and amortization are no longer recognized. Held for sale properties are evaluated quarterly to ensure that properties continue to meet the held for sale criteria. If\nproperties are required to be reclassified from held for sale to held for use due to changes to a plan of sale, they are recorded at the lower of fair value or the carrying amount\nbefore the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been\ncontinuously classified as held and used. Properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria are accounted for as operating properties.\nThe Company executed a contract to sell the property located at 15091 SW Alabama, Huntsville, AL for $6.15 million in September 2024, As of the reporting date, the\ntransaction has not consummated in a sale and the Company is actively engaged in discussions with other potential buyers. As such, the Company has reclassified the asset\nto Held for sale assets net of the costs of sales at a carrying value of approximately $5.75 million and recorded an impairment loss of approximately $1.06 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under Section 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable\nyear ending December 31, 2021. To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to\ndistribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its\ntaxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying\n13\nconsolidated financial statements relates to the Company's consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary of which no income was generated during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company also recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is not more-likely-than-not\nthat the positions will be sustained on examination, including resolution of the related processes, if any. As of each balance sheet date, unrecognized benefits are reassessed\nand adjusted if the Company’s judgment changes as a result of new information. No liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company's tax returns for the years 2020 forward remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.\nEarnings per Share\nIn accordance with ASC 260, Earning Per Share, basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss attributable to the Company that is available to\ncommon stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted\nEPS gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock warrants, using the treasury stock method, and convertible\ndebt, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive securities such as warrants and convertible membership units of the Operating Partnership\n(“GIP LP Units”) if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all potentially dilutive securities were excluded because\nthe effect was anti-dilutive.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values of our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and discount rates. Such\namounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to estimates that may change in the future.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value\nhierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within\nLevels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\n•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.\nThe Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at\nfair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs. See Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 10 for additional information on the Company's fair\nvalue measurements.\nNote 3 – Acquired Lease Intangible Assets, net\nIn-place leases, net is comprised of the following:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nIn-place leases $ 8,844,500 $ 8,914,075\nAccumulated amortization (2,857,652) (2,411,802)\nIn-place leases, net $ 5,986,848 $ 6,502,273\n14\nThe amortization for in-place leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $346,404 and $359,010, and 1,090,135 and 630,312, respectively.\nThe future amortization for in-place leases, net for subsequent years ending December 31, is listed below:\nAs of September 30,\n2024\n2024 (3 months remaining) $ 369,087\n2025 1,430,164\n2026 1,328,912\n2027 936,941\n2028 734,784\nThereafter 1,186,960\n$ 5,986,848\nThe Company acquired in place lease intangible assets of $574,710 reflected in the tables above as of September 30, 2024.\nAbove-market leases, net is comprised of the following:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nAbove-market leases $ 1,657,257 $ 1,657,256\nAccumulated amortization (475,097) (169,784)\nAbove-market leases, net $ 1,182,160 $ 1,487,472\nThe amortization for above-market leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $101,770 and $55,337, and $305,312 and $55,337,\nrespectively.

The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of\n$1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest\nin GIP SPE (the “Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in\nthe amount of 5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum\n(compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first\nto LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is\nless than 10%, in which case the balance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by\nthe trailing three-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also\nprovides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount”\n(defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.\n19\nThe Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the\nLC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount. Upon a failure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at\nan increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month\nextension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is\nincreased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as\ndefined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’ senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period,\nand there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.\nUnder the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having\nbeen paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.\nDue to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of\n$2,280,471 as of September 30, 2024.\nEach of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the\ndiscretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the\nOperating Partnership (\"GIP LP Units\"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the\nOperating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such\npreferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units\nshall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership.\nAdditionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the\nacquisition.\nNon-Controlling Interest (Permanent Equity)\nAs part of the Company’s acquisition of one property on November 30, 2020 for $1,847,700 in Tampa, FL, the Operating Partnership entered into a contribution agreement\nwith GIP Fund 1, LLC that resulted in the issuance of 24,309 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at $20.00 per share for a total value of $486,180. At the time of the\nacquisition, the Company’s President owned 11% of GIP Fund 1. GIP Fund 1 has since been dissolved and the GIP Units are now directly owned by the former members of\nGIP Fund 1. After 12 months, the contribution agreement allows for the former members of GIP Fund 1 to require the Operating Partnership to redeem, all or a portion of its\nGIP LP Units for common stock of the Company. As such, the Company has determined their equity should be classified as a Non-controlling interest.\nFollowing these transactions as of September 30, 2024, the Company owned 95.3% of the common units in the Operating Partnership and outside investors owned 4.7%. The\nfollowing table reflects the Company's redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interest during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023:\n20\nGIP LP\n(Former Non-\nBrown Greenwal Controllin\nFamily , L.C. and Total g\nTrust and Riverside Redeema Interests\nBrown Crossing, ble Non- - Former\nFamily Richard LMB L.C.

An additional incremental increase is the result of the guaranty fee expense to the Company's\nCEO of $96,652 and $304,245 incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n•Compensation costs decreased by $49,798 and $163,598, respectively, primarily due to savings in salary expense and for accounting and administrative staff.\nNet loss\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated a net loss of $2,103,549 and $1,213,265 and $5,444,133 and 3,156,015, respectively.\nOther expense\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued $0 and $506,000 relating to the potential reimbursement of federal, state and local income taxes\nincurred by a remaining partner in one of our partnerships pursuant to a tax protection agreement.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $866,047 and $425,637 and $2,612,405 and\n$681,916, respectively. The variance is attributable to additional redeemable non-controlling interests established during the second half of fiscal year 2023 to facilitate\nacquisitions, namely the acquisition of the 13 property Modiv portfolio in August 2023.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated a net loss attributable to our shareholders of $2,969,596 and $1,828,902 and $8,151,537\nand 4,027,931, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund our investment activities and operating expenses. Our capital sources may include net proceeds from offerings of our equity securities, cash flow\nfrom operations and borrowings under credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash (unrestricted and restricted) of $1,581,610, properties with a gross cost basis\nof $102,307,436 and outstanding mortgage loans with a principal balance of $59,707,772, excluding assets held for sale for $5.75 million.\nIn September 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,665,000 units at a price to the public of $10 per unit generating net proceeds of $13.8 million including\nissuance costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOn April 1, 2022, we entered into two mortgage loan agreements with an aggregate balance of $13.5 million to refinance seven of our properties. The loan agreements consist\nof one loan in the amount of $11.4 million secured by six properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value, and one loan in the amount of $2.1\nmillion on the property previously held in the tenancy-in-common investment at an interest rate of 3.85% from April 1, 2022 through and until March 31, 2027. In conjunction\nwith\n33\nthe LC2 Investment to purchase the remaining interest in the tenancy-in-common interest discussed above, the Company assumed the original $2.1 million loan on the property\nwith a remaining balance of $2,079,178 and recognized a discount of $383,767. Effective April 1, 2027 and through the maturity date of March 31, 2032, the interest rate\nadjusts to the 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and is subject to a floor of 3.85%. Our CEO entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment\nobligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-boy” provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership.\nOn August 10, 2023, GIP13, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GIP SPE (\"GIP Borrower\"), entered into a Loan Agreement with\nValley pursuant to which Valley made a loan to the Company in the amount of $21.0 million to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The outstanding principal amount\nof the loan bears interest at an annual rate for each 30-day interest period equal to the compounded average of the secured overnight financing rate published by Federal Reserve\nBank of New York for the thirty-day period prior to the last day of each 30-day interest rate for the applicable interest rate period plus 3.25%, with interest payable monthly\nafter each 30-day interest period. However, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47% per annum. Payments of interest and principal in the\namount of approximately $156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date of August 10,\n2028. The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid financing fees. The loan is\nsecured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP SPE that had\noutstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the subsidiaries of the\nCompany that hold the properties that comprise the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement also provides for customary events of default and other customary affirmative and\nnegative covenants that are applicable to GIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, including reporting covenants and restrictions on investments, additional indebtedness, liens, sales\nof properties, certain mergers, and certain management changes. The Company's President and CEO also entered into a personal, full recourse guarantee with a $7,500,000 cap.\nOn June 27, 2024, the Operating Partnership and an accredited investor entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the “June 2024 Unit Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which\nthe Operating Partnership issued and sold to the investor 500,000 Series A Preferred Units at a price of $5.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of two million five\nhundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) in cash. Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Units, the investor will be paid cumulative cash distributions in the amount of $0.325\nper Series A Preferred Unit per year, payable monthly in arrears, on or about the 15th day of each month. Each of the investor and the Operating Partnership will have the right\nto cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred Units after two (2) years for cash in an amount equal to $5.15 per Series A Preferred Unit plus any accrued\nbut unpaid Series A Preferred Return, provided that the Operating Partnership may (with the prior written consent of the investor) cause the redemption price to be satisfied by\nthe issuance of a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the number of Series A Preferred Units being redeemed multiplied by 1.03 plus any accrued but\nunpaid Series A Preferred Return. If the Operating Partnership fails to declare and pay the Series A Preferred Return for a period of three consecutive months, the investor may\nexercise the foregoing redemption right within the 30-day period following such failure.\nOur President and CEO has also personally guaranteed the repayment of the $10.6 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks - South Tampa, FL; and vacant -\nHuntsville, AL loan as well as the $1.3 million loan secured by the Company's Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL property. In addition, our President and CEO has also provided a\nguaranty of the Company’s nonrecourse carveout liabilities and obligations in favor of the lender for the GSA and PRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA mortgage loans (\"Bayport\nloans\") with an aggregate principal amount of $11.6 million.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a guaranty fee expense to our President and CEO of $102,023 and $304,245, respectively, recorded to\ninterest expense. A guaranty fee expense of $81,022 and $196,304 was incurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOn August 9, 2022, we entered a Redemption Agreement with a unit holder. As such, we recorded another payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution\nof the Redemption Agreement entered into July 20, 2022 and has since made installment payments of $2,007,380 to date with a remaining balance of $904,920 outstanding as\nof September 30, 2024.\nOn October 14, 2022, we entered into a loan transaction that is evidenced by a secured non-convertible promissory note to Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, a preferred equity\npartner and therefore a related party, for $1.5 million that is due on October 14, 2024, and bears a fixed interest rate of 9% with simple interest payable monthly. On July 21,\n2023, the Company amended and restated the promissory note to reflect an increase in the loan to $5.5 million and extend the maturity date thereof from October 14, 2024 to\nOctober 14, 2026. Except for the increase in the amount of the Loan and Note and the extension of the maturity date thereof, no changes were made to the original note. The\nloan may be repaid without penalty at any time. The loan is secured by the Operating Partnership’s equity interest in its current direct subsidiaries that hold real estate assets\npursuant to the terms of a security agreement between the Operating Partnership and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC.\n34\nWe currently obtain the capital required to primarily invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial net lease real estate investments and conduct our operations\nfrom the proceeds of equity offerings, debt financings, preferred minority interest obtained from third parties, issuance of Operating Partnership units and from any\nundistributed funds from our operations.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of $783,511 and had cash on hand of $1.58 million as of September 30,\n2024. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern\none year after the date that these financial statements are issued. In August 2024 the Company modified terms for two secured mortgage loans set to expire in September 2024\nand October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balances of the modified secured loans were $7.2 million and $4.4 million at 6.15% annual interest with maturity\ndates extended to August 2029. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon continued successful execution of management’s plan to improve the\nCompany’s liquidity and profitability.\n35\nOutstanding mortgage loans payable consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\nOriginal\nLoan Interest Maturity 9/30/20 12/31/2 Debt Service Coverage\nOccupying Tenant Location Amount Rate Date 24 023 Ratios (\"DSCR\") Required\n7-Eleven Corporation & Washington, D.C., $ 11,28 (a) 4.17% 3/6/2030 $10,619 $10,757 1.25\nStarbucks Corporation Tampa, FL, and 7,500 ,578 ,239\nHuntsville, AL\nGeneral Services Administration- Norfolk, VA 8,260, (f) 6.15% 8/30/2029 7,165, 7,341, 1.25\nNavy & AYMCA 000 788 804\nPRA Holdings, Inc.

Because of the redemption right, the non-controlling interest is presented as temporary equity at an aggregated redemption value of $3,000,000 as of September 30, 2024.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio, the Operating Partnership and LC2 entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for\nGIP SPE (the “GIP SPE Operating Agreement”) pursuant to which LC2 made a $12.0 million initial capital contribution to GIP SPE, together with a commitment to make an\nadditional $2.1 million contribution upon the satisfactory completion of the acquisition of a tenant-in-common interest held by a third party in the Company’s Rockford, Illinois\nproperty (the “LC2 Investment”). The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of $1.3 million and\nLC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest in GIP SPE (the\n“Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in the amount of 5%\nper annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum (compounded monthly) is\ndeemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued\nbut unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is less than 10%, in which case the\nbalance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month\nannualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions\nfrom capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as the amount equal\nto 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.\nThe Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the LC2\nInvestment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount. Upon a\n37\nfailure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at an increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to\nextend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month extension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of\nthe LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is increased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii)\nthe trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’\nsenior debt is extended through the end of the extension period, and there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.\nUnder the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having\nbeen paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.\nDue to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of $2,280,471\nas of September 30, 2024.\nEach of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the\ndiscretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the\nOperating Partnership (\"GIP LP Units\"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the\nOperating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such\npreferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units shall\nthen be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership.\nAdditionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the\nacquisition.\nThe primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility using retained cash flows, long-term debt and common and perpetual preferred stock to\nfinance our growth. We intend to have a lower-leveraged portfolio over the long-term after we have acquired an initial substantial portfolio of diversified investments. During\nthe period when we are acquiring our current portfolio, we will employ greater leverage on individual assets (that will also result in greater leverage of the current portfolio) in\norder to quickly build a diversified portfolio of assets.\nCash from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $783,511 and net cash provided by operating activities was $18,537 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The change is due to the doubling of the number of the Company's income generating assets through the 13 property Modiv acquisition.\nCash from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $5,960,893. Net cash used in investing activities was $33,314,973 during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to an escrow deposit for a property purchase.\nCash from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3,607,045 and $33,916,112 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to several\nfactors comprising the increase of mortgage principal repayments driven by the Modiv acquisition in August 2023, the increase in distributions to non-controlling interests, and\ndividend payments on both preferred and common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial\ncondition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n38\nOur reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\"), adjusted funds\nfrom operations (\"AFFO\"), core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and core adjusted funds of operations (\"Core AFFO\") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We\nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating\nperformance of REITs.\nFFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly,\nthey should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a\nliquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT\ndefines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude, net gains from sales of property and adding back real estate depreciation; namely, excluding from net income\ndepreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-\ndowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by an entity.\nWe then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line\nrent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO.\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it\nexcludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate\ndiminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors\nto consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not\nbe comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors\nbecause they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our\nperformance when we formulate corporate goals.\nAs FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and non-recurring or extraordinary\nitems, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs,\ngeneral and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an\nalternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs\nnecessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations.\nAdditionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n39\nThe following tables reconcile net income (net loss), which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and Core AFFO:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (2,103,549) $ (1,213,265) $ (5,444,133) $ (3,156,015)\nOther expense - 639 - 506,639\nLoss on derivative valuation 734,116 - 308,570 -\nDepreciation and amortization 1,068,081 981,419 3,474,918 2,096,970\nLoss on held for sale asset valuation - - 1,058,994 -\nFunds From Operations $ (301,352) $ (231,207) $ (601,651) $ (552,406)\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 60,532 46,260 156,091 103,990\nNon-cash stock compensation 94,935 119,380 284,804 287,067\nAdjustments to Funds From Operations 155,467 165,640 440,895 391,057\nCore Funds From Operations $ (145,885) $ (65,567) $ (160,756) $ (161,349)\nNet loss $ (2,103,549) $ (1,213,265) $ (5,444,133) $ (3,156,015)\nOther expense - 639 - 506,639\nLoss on derivative valuation 734,116 - 308,570 -\nDepreciation and amortization 1,068,081 981,419 3,474,918 2,096,970\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 60,532 46,260 156,091 103,990\nAbove and below-market lease amortization, net 203,357 20,398 203,357 (81,957)\nStraight line rent, net 42,972 20,942 74,253 61,383\nAdjustments to net loss $ 2,109,058 $ 1,069,658 $ 4,217,189 $ 2,687,025\nAdjusted Funds From Operations $ 5,509 $ (143,607) $ (1,226,944) $ (468,990)\nDead deal expense $ - $ - $ 35,873 $ 109,569\nNon-cash stock compensation 94,935 119,380 284,804 287,067\nAdjustments to Adjusted Funds From Operations $ 94,935 $ 119,380 $ 320,677 $ 396,636\nCore Adjusted Funds From Operations $ 100,444 $ (24,227) $ (906,267) $ (72,354)\nThe table above presents FFO in accordance with the most current available NAREIT guidance and in alignment with current industry standards. Presentations of FFO in our\nprior filings and announcements did not include Loss on held for sale asset valuation as an add-back in calculating FFO, but the data for three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 set forth above has been revised to include Loss on held for sale asset valuation as an add-back.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. See our audited\nconsolidated financial statements included herein for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures\npursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective as of September 30, 2024.\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\n40\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n41\nPART II.
