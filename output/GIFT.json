It took so much time digging into the research, and there was always the guessing element, leaving us with the risk of either losing a valid sale, or facing a chargeback. \n\nAfter looking into payment processing companies who offer fraud protection as part of their services, and realising that their approval rates were too low, we signed up with FraudFix. At FraudFix, there’s always somebody to talk to, and their approvals are really fast – no more waiting a day or longer. Other companies we’ve tried took forever (or close to it!) to approve transactions. The best part with FraudFix is that if they slip up, we get paid back without any hassle. There’s no paperwork and long claim process; just an easy, convenient, no-questions-asked refund.\n\nWe’ve been with FraudFix for many years and I recommend them to colleagues all the time. It’s very low-risk, saves a lot of time for everyone in the company, and there’s an exceptionally high approval rate – we’ve never had a good order marked as fraud.\n\n#### Moshe Schnitzer\n\nCEO, Gemnation\n\n[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.fraudfix.com/logo-main-dark.svg)](/)[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.fraudfix.com/logo-main-dark.svg)](/)\n\n[![](/illustration/social-icons/facebook.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/FraudFix-514485039382925/?modal=admin_todo_tour)[![](/illustration/social-icons/twitter.svg)](https://twitter.com/RealFraudFix)[![](/illustration/social-icons/instagram.svg)](https://www.instagram.com/realfraudfix/)[![](/illustration/social-icons/linkedin.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fraudfix-com/)\n\nCopyright © 2024 by FraudFix.
