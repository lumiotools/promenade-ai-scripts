(Nasdaq: SMLR), a pioneer in developing and marketing technology products and services to healthcare providers to combat chronic diseases, today announced updates regarding its bitcoin (BTC) activity and holdings, capital markets activity, and BTC Yield, a key performance indicator.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Semler Scientific, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2394289/Semler_Logo_registered.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2394289/Semler_Logo_registered.html)\n\n**BTC Update**\n\nBetween November 25, 2024 and December 4, 2024, Semler Scientific acquired 303 bitcoins for $29.3 million with proceeds generated from its at-the-market (ATM) offering at an average price of $96,779 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. As of December 4, 2024, Semler Scientific held 1,873 bitcoins, which were acquired for an aggregate $147.1 million at an average purchase price of $78,553 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.\n\n**ATM Update**\n\nAs previously disclosed in Semler Scientific's registration statement on Form S-3 that became effective on August 13, 2024 (the S-3 Shelf), Semler Scientific entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (Cantor), pursuant to which Semler Scientific may offer and sell from time to time its common stock in an ATM offering.\n\nOn November 25, 2024, Semler Scientific filed a prospectus supplement to its S-3 Shelf to offer an additional $50.0 million of shares under its existing ATM offering with Cantor, increasing the total amount offered under the ATM to $100.0 million. As of December 4, 2024, Semler Scientific has generated approximately $79.8 million of gross proceeds from sales under the ATM offering.\n\n**BTC Yield as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**\n\nFrom October 1, 2024 to December 4, 2024, Semler Scientific's BTC Yield was 54.7%. From July 1, 2024 (the quarter after Semler Scientific adopted its bitcoin treasury strategy) to December 4, 2024, Semler Scientific's BTC Yield was 78.7%.\n\n\"We are very pleased to report BTC Yield of 78.7%,\" said Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific. \"In addition, we have requested approval from the options exchanges to allow options trading in our stock as we believe we satisfy their eligibility requirements.\"\n\nSemler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a KPI to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders. Semler Scientific believes this KPI can be used to supplement an investor's understanding of Semler Scientific's decision to fund the purchase of bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock.\n\n_BTC Yield and Basic and Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding_\n\n** _ 6/30/2024 _**| ** _ 9/30/2024 _**| ** _ 12/4/2024 _**  \n---|---|---  \nTotal Bitcoin Holdings| 877| 1,018| 1,873  \n**Basic Shares Outstanding ('000)**|  6,987| 7,120| 8,813  \nOptions Outstanding| 1,098| 1,013| 855  \n**Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding(1)**| 8,086| 8,133| 9,667  \n**BTC Yield % ( 10/1/24 to 12/04/24)**| 54.7 %  \n**BTC Yield % ( 7/1/24 to 12/04/24)**| 78.7 %  \n  \n(1)| Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of Semler Scientific's Basic Shares outstanding as of the end of each period plus all the additional shares that would result from the assumed exercise of all outstanding stock option awards. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding is not calculated using the treasury method and does not take into account any vesting conditions or the exercise price of any stock option awards.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Important Information about BTC Yield KPI**\n\nBTC Yield is a KPI that represents the percentage change period-to-period of the ratio between Semler Scientific's bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of Semler Scientific's actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed exercise of all outstanding stock option awards. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding is not calculated using the treasury method and does not take into account any vesting conditions or the exercise price of any stock option awards.\n\nSemler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a KPI to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders. Semler Scientific believes this KPI can be used to supplement an investor's understanding of its decision to fund the purchase of bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock. When Semler Scientific uses this KPI, management also takes into account the various limitations of this metric.\n\nAdditionally, this KPI is not, and should not be understood as, an operating performance measure or a financial or liquidity measure. In particular, BTC Yield is not equivalent to a \"yield\" in the traditional financial context. It is not a measure of the return on investment Semler Scientific's stockholders may have achieved historically or can achieve in the future by purchasing stock of Semler Scientific, or a measure of income generated by Semler Scientific's operations or its bitcoin holdings, return on investment on its bitcoin holdings, or any other similar financial measure of the performance of its business or assets.\n\nThe trading price of Semler Scientific's common stock is informed by numerous factors in addition to the amount of bitcoins Semler Scientific holds and number of actual or potential shares of its stock outstanding. As a result, the market value of Semler Scientific's shares may trade at a discount or a premium relative to the market value of the bitcoin Semler Scientific holds. BTC Yield is not indicative nor predictive of the trading price of Semler Scientific's shares of common stock. As noted above, this KPI is narrow in its purpose and is used by management to assist in assessing whether Semler Scientific is using equity capital in a manner accretive to stockholders solely as it pertains to its bitcoin holdings.\n\nIn calculating this KPI, Semler Scientific does not take into account the source of capital used for the acquisition of its bitcoin. Semler Scientific notes in particular, it has acquired bitcoin using cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from the sale of shares in the ATM offering. Accordingly, this metric might overstate or understate the accretive nature of Semler Scientific's use of equity capital to buy bitcoin because not all bitcoin may be acquired using proceeds of equity offerings and not all issuances of equity may involve the acquisition of bitcoin.\n\nSemler Scientific's ability to achieve positive BTC Yield may depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its fixed charges and other expenses, as well as factors outside of its control, such as the availability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nSemler Scientific has historically not paid dividends on its shares of common stock, and by presenting this KPI, Semler Scientific makes no suggestion that it intends to do so in the future. Ownership of common stock does not represent an ownership interest in the bitcoin Semler Scientific holds.\n\nInvestors should rely on the financial statements and other disclosures contained in Semler Scientific's SEC filings. This KPI is merely a supplement, not a substitute. It should be used only by sophisticated investors who understand its limited purpose and many limitations.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking\" statements. Such statements can be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking language such as the words \"believe,\" \"goal,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"would,\" \"could\" or words with similar meaning or the negatives of these terms or by the discussion of strategy or intentions.

These forward-looking statements involve assumptions, estimates, and uncertainties that reflect current internal projections, expectations or beliefs. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

Copies of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the ATM offering may be obtained by visiting EDGAR on the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4318310-1&h=1196011875&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov). or may be obtained from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Attention: Capital Markets, 110 East 59th Street, New York, New York 10022, or by email at prospectus@cantor.com.\n\n**About Semler Scientific, Inc.:**\n\nSemler Scientific, Inc. is a pioneer in developing and marketing technology products and services to healthcare providers to combat chronic diseases.
