(NASDAQ: GAIA),** a conscious media and community company, reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n  * 10% growth in revenue with large acceleration expected in next quarter.\n  * Sixth consecutive quarter of positive operating and free cash flow.\n\n\n\n“Over the last few months we raised, for the first time in our history, our subscription prices for all members by at least two dollars. While the initial losses from the price increase kept our member count flat, we expect that the price increases will push our revenue to almost $24 million during fourth quarter, up from $22.2 million currently,” said Jirka Rysavy, Gaia’s Chairman.\n\n“Q3 marks another successful quarter of free cash flow generation while maintaining double-digit growth, reinforcing our position as a leader in conscious media. We’re especially encouraged by the positive momentum and early success of our recent price adjustments, which are setting a solid foundation for accelerated growth heading into Q4 and 2025,” said James Colquhoun, Gaia’s CEO. “Additionally, we would like to announce our partnership with ElevenLabs, who will now be Gaia’s official provider for AI dubbing and translation across multiple languages. This partnership helps us to enhance our operating efficiency as we continue growing our international audience.”\n\nGaia CFO Ned Preston commented: “Operating cash flows for the first nine months finished at $4.3 million, representing a $1.6 million improvement from the first nine months of 2023 and continues the momentum we've delivered in the prior five quarters.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter grew $2.0 million or 10% to $22.2 million from $20.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Member count increased on a year-over-year standpoint to 846,000 as of September 30, 2024, up from 790,500 or 7% from September 30, 2023.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter increased 11% to $19.1 million from $17.2 million and gross margins improved to 86.0% from 85.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNet loss was $(1.2) million, or $(0.05) per share compared to the year-ago quarter at $(0.8) million, or $(0.04) per share. Adjusting for the $1.8 million ERTC (Employee Retention Tax Credit) recognized in the third quarter of 2023, the quarterly net loss improved by $1.4 million.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, operating cash flow was $0.4 million and free cash flow was $0.1 million, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow. \n\nIn the last nine months revenue grew 10.4%, with an improvement in operating cash flow of $1.6 million and free cash flow of $1.5 million.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nDate: Monday, November 4, 2024Time: 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (2:30 p.m. Mountain time)Toll-free dial-in number: 1-877-269-7751International dial-in number: 1-201-389-0908Conference ID: 13749012\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When used in this discussion, we intend the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strive,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions as they relate to us to identify such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ include, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for customer engagement with different modes of entertainment; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuation in customer usage of our service; fluctuations in quarterly operating results; service disruptions; production risks; general economic conditions; future losses; loss of key personnel; price changes; brand reputation; acquisitions; new initiatives we undertake; security and information systems; legal liability for website content; failure of third parties to provide adequate service; future internet-related taxes; our founder’s control of us; litigation; consumer trends; the effect of government regulation and programs; the impact of public health threats; our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and technical accounting; and other risks and uncertainties included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution you that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect our views only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), the financial information included in this release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures and results calculated in accordance with GAAP, including net income, and reconciliations to GAAP financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities plus cash paid for interest payments, less cash used in investing activities, plus cash from non-core business activities. We believe Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Gaia’s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, Gaia’s calculation of Free Cash Flow might not necessarily be comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\n\n**Company Contact:** Ned PrestonChief Financial OfficerGaia,

This immersive experience will take place November 9 – 10 at Gaia’s state-of-the-art event center, the GaiaSphere, at the Company’s headquarters in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThis catalyzing weekend event builds upon teachings from Gores’ documentary, which explores the power of the mind-body connection and the body’s natural healing capabilities. Gores will share the learnings of the HEAL brand with attendees, spreading knowledge about the remarkable ability and intelligence of the human body to expand one’s belief of what’s possible and inspire individuals to become conscious co-creators with their lives.\n\n“Live events like our HEAL Conference are a powerful tool in deepening connection, inspiring positive change and ultimately elevating the human consciousness,” said Kiersten Medvedich, Gaia President. “Through our streaming platform, [Gaia.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tQUbn8990kitgrAxzfUaHyjFdXE43NtsndEJYymRgUZMgyn0LZ_xVqaaj_HOmn4tb58McGiWwJgHFyogr4ZP7Q==), we have built a transformational community of individuals from across the globe who connect with our content, and we are excited to move beyond the screen to deepen those connections at this one-of-a-kind event.

To remedy this trend, the HEAL Conference will feature a slate of renowned speakers and practitioners whose aim is to empower attendees with ancient wisdom and modern science, share inspiring examples of infinite possibility and guide attendees to activate their powerful healer within. The speaker lineup and sessions includes:\n\n  * Medical Medium Anthony William – Medical Medium Healing Tools\n  * Gregg Braden – Igniting Pure Human Technology\n  * Dr. Shefali – Turning Pain to Power\n  * Michael Beckwith – How to Unplug for Better Bonding\n  * Rob Wergin – Healing That Transcends Time\n  * Lauren Roxburgh – The Connective Power of Fascia\n  * Peter Crone – Finding Freedom\n  * David Brownstein, MD – A Holistic Thyroid Approach\n\n\n\n“We have great control over our health, however, very few people realize the power of the mind-body-connection and the body’s incredible capacity to heal,” said Gores. “I am honored to host the HEAL Conference with Gaia and hope to inspire all of the attendees to tap into their unlimited potential and awaken the powerful healer within.”\n\nGeneral admission tickets are available for Gaia members for $499.50 and non-members for $555.00.
