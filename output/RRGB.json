(NASDAQ: RRGB) (\"Red Robin\" or the \"Company\"), a full-service restaurant chain serving an innovative selection of high-quality gourmet burgers in a family-friendly atmosphere, today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended October 6, 2024.\n\n**Highlights for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024, Compared to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023:**\n\n  * Total revenues are $274.6 million, a decrease of $2.9 million.\n  * Comparable restaurant revenue(1) increased 0.6%.\n  * Net loss is $18.9 million, compared to a net loss of $8.2 million last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(2) is $2.1 million compared to $6.8 million last year.\n  * Relaunched loyalty program increased to 14.5 million members compared to 13.1 million last year.\n  * Subsequent to the close of the third quarter, executed an amendment to the credit agreement that extends the adjustments to the financial covenants and expanded revolver capacity through the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\n\n\n**Highlights for the Year to Date Period of Fiscal 2024, Compared to the Year to Date Period of Fiscal 2023:**\n\n  * Total revenues are $963.3 million, a decrease of $30.7 million.\n  * Comparable restaurant revenue(1) declined 2.6% excluding a deferred revenue benefit led by the change in the Company's loyalty program. Including this benefit, Comparable restaurant revenue(1) declined 2.1%.\n  * Net loss is $37.8 million, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(2) is $26.1 million compared to $58.3 million last year.\n  * Completed a sale-leaseback transaction for ten restaurants in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, generating net proceeds of approximately $23.3 million and a gain, net of expenses of $7.4 million.\n\n\n\n(1) Comparable restaurant revenue represents revenue from Company-owned restaurants that have operated 18 months as of the beginning of the period presented.  \n---  \n(2) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results\" below for more details.  \n  \nG.J. Hart, Red Robin's President and Chief Executive Officer said, \"Our third quarter results were largely in-line with our expectations and we continue to make progress against our North Star Plan.\"\n\nHart continued, \"Our North Star Plan is working with our comparable restaurant revenue exceeding the industry average, as measured by BlackBox, and our traffic returning to in line with the industry as we moved through the third quarter. With our guest satisfaction scores continuing to improve and at levels not seen since 2016, our guests are beginning to reward us for the investments we have made to revitalize Red Robin. Importantly, we are capitalizing on this momentum through our re-launched loyalty program and believe we are only scratching the surface of our potential.\"\n\nHart concluded, \"Despite the macroeconomic backdrop that has made our comeback journey more challenging, our team has remained focused on what we can control through effective execution of our strategic plan. Ultimately, we believe we are on the right path to drive sustainable long-term growth and return this beloved brand to prominence in the industry.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nThe following table presents financial results for the fiscal third quarter and year to date periods of 2024, compared to results from the same periods in 2023 ($ in millions except per share data):\n\n**Twelve Weeks Ended** |  **Forty Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**October 6, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **October 6, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nTotal revenues  |  $ 274.6 |  $ 277.6 |  $ 963.3 |  $ 994.0  \nRestaurant revenues  |  270.6 |  273.1 |  943.6 |  973.3  \nNet income (loss) |  (18.9) |  (8.2) |  (37.8) |  (7.5)  \nIncome (loss) from operations  |  (12.9) |  (1.9) |  (19.6) |  12.5  \nIncome (loss) from operations as a percent of total revenues |  (4.7) % |  (0.7) % |  (2.0) % |  1.3 %  \nRestaurant Level Operating Profit(1) |  $ 24.2 |  $ 30.4 |  $ 100.4 |  $ 127.2  \nRestaurant Level Operating Profit Margin(1) |  9.0 % |  11.1 % |  10.6 % |  13.1 %  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $ 2.1 |  $ 6.8 |  $ 26.1 |  $ 58.3  \nNet income (loss) per diluted share  |  $ (1.20) |  $ (0.52) |  $ (2.42) |  $ (0.47)  \nAdjusted income (loss) per diluted share(1) |  $ (1.13) |  $ (0.79) |  $ (2.39) |  $ (0.78)  \n  \n(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results\" below for more details.  \n---  \n  \n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nAs of October 6, 2024, Red Robin had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $187.9 million and liquidity of approximately $42.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under its credit facility.\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our credit agreement (the \"Second Amendment\"). The Second Amendment among other things: provides certain relief by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio covenant beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025; increases the aggregate revolving commitments by $15.0 million to $40.0 million through the third quarter of 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term loans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to 7.50% per annum and that are ABR-based loans to 6.50% per annum; and adds additional reporting requirements.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to our credit agreement (the \"Third Amendment\") which extended the terms of the Second Amendment through the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe Second Amendment and Third Amendment provide additional flexibility to support the Company's execution of its North Star business strategy. Additional information on the terms of the Second Amendment and Third Amendment can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Outlook for Fiscal 2024 and Guidance Policy**\n\nThe Company provides guidance of select information related to its financial and operating performance, and such measures may differ from year to year. The projections are as of this date and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement this information.\n\nThe Company's updated guidance for fiscal 2024 is:\n\n  * Total revenue of approximately $1.250 billion;\n  * Restaurant level operating profit of at least 10.5%, inclusive of investments in the Guest experience and rent expense related to the sale leaseback transactions;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $35.0 million to $37.5 million;\n  * Capital expenditures of approximately $25 million.\n\n\n\nFiscal 2024 includes 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2023.\n\nProviding Income (loss) from operations and Net income (loss) guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and other non-core operating items. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures.\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nRed Robin will host an investor conference call to discuss financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024 and outlook for fiscal 2024 today at 4:30 p.m. ET. The conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 201-689-8560 which will be answered by an operator or by clicking [Call Me™](https://callme.viavid.com/viavid/?callme=true&passcode=13728550&h=true&info=company&r=true&B=6 \"Opens in a new window\").

The replay will be available through Wednesday, November 13, 2024.\n\nThe call will be webcast live and later archived from the Company's Investor Relations website.\n\n**Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per share-diluted are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures give the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company, and are intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per share-diluted exclude the impact of non-operating or nonrecurring items including changes in estimates, asset impairments, litigation contingencies, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, restaurant and office closure costs, gains on sale leaseback transactions, severance and executive transition costs and other non-recurring, non-cash or discrete items; net of income tax impacts. Other companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently, and as a result may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Management believes this supplemental information will assist with comparisons of past and future financial results against the present financial results presented herein.\n\nThe Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less franchise revenue and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs, selling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, pre-opening costs, as well as, other charges (gains), net because these costs are non-operating or nonrecurring and therefore not related to the ongoing operations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income (loss) from operations as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the Company's industry.\n\n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share -

(NASDAQ: RRGB) (\"Red Robin\" or the \"Company\"), a full-service restaurant chain serving an innovative selection of high-quality gourmet burgers in a family-friendly atmosphere, today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended October 6, 2024.\n\n**Highlights for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024, Compared to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023:**\n\n  * Total revenues are $274.6 million, a decrease of $2.9 million.\n  * Comparable restaurant revenue(1) increased 0.6%.\n  * Net loss is $18.9 million, compared to a net loss of $8.2 million last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(2) is $2.1 million compared to $6.8 million last year.\n  * Relaunched loyalty program increased to 14.5 million members compared to 13.1 million last year.\n  * Subsequent to the close of the third quarter, executed an amendment to the credit agreement that extends the adjustments to the financial covenants and expanded revolver capacity through the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\n\n\n**Highlights for the Year to Date Period of Fiscal 2024, Compared to the Year to Date Period of Fiscal 2023:**\n\n  * Total revenues are $963.3 million, a decrease of $30.7 million.\n  * Comparable restaurant revenue(1) declined 2.6% excluding a deferred revenue benefit led by the change in the Company's loyalty program. Including this benefit, Comparable restaurant revenue(1) declined 2.1%.\n  * Net loss is $37.8 million, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(2) is $26.1 million compared to $58.3 million last year.\n  * Completed a sale-leaseback transaction for ten restaurants in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, generating net proceeds of approximately $23.3 million and a gain, net of expenses of $7.4 million.\n\n\n\n(1) Comparable restaurant revenue represents revenue from Company-owned restaurants that have operated 18 months as of the beginning of the period presented.  \n---  \n(2) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results\" below for more details.  \n  \nG.J. Hart, Red Robin's President and Chief Executive Officer said, \"Our third quarter results were largely in-line with our expectations and we continue to make progress against our North Star Plan.\"\n\nHart continued, \"Our North Star Plan is working with our comparable restaurant revenue exceeding the industry average, as measured by BlackBox, and our traffic returning to in line with the industry as we moved through the third quarter. With our guest satisfaction scores continuing to improve and at levels not seen since 2016, our guests are beginning to reward us for the investments we have made to revitalize Red Robin. Importantly, we are capitalizing on this momentum through our re-launched loyalty program and believe we are only scratching the surface of our potential.\"\n\nHart concluded, \"Despite the macroeconomic backdrop that has made our comeback journey more challenging, our team has remained focused on what we can control through effective execution of our strategic plan. Ultimately, we believe we are on the right path to drive sustainable long-term growth and return this beloved brand to prominence in the industry.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nThe following table presents financial results for the fiscal third quarter and year to date periods of 2024, compared to results from the same periods in 2023 ($ in millions except per share data):\n\n**Twelve Weeks Ended** |  **Forty Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**October 6, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **October 6, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nTotal revenues  |  $ 274.6 |  $ 277.6 |  $ 963.3 |  $ 994.0  \nRestaurant revenues  |  270.6 |  273.1 |  943.6 |  973.3  \nNet income (loss) |  (18.9) |  (8.2) |  (37.8) |  (7.5)  \nIncome (loss) from operations  |  (12.9) |  (1.9) |  (19.6) |  12.5  \nIncome (loss) from operations as a percent of total revenues |  (4.7) % |  (0.7) % |  (2.0) % |  1.3 %  \nRestaurant Level Operating Profit(1) |  $ 24.2 |  $ 30.4 |  $ 100.4 |  $ 127.2  \nRestaurant Level Operating Profit Margin(1) |  9.0 % |  11.1 % |  10.6 % |  13.1 %  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $ 2.1 |  $ 6.8 |  $ 26.1 |  $ 58.3  \nNet income (loss) per diluted share  |  $ (1.20) |  $ (0.52) |  $ (2.42) |  $ (0.47)  \nAdjusted income (loss) per diluted share(1) |  $ (1.13) |  $ (0.79) |  $ (2.39) |  $ (0.78)  \n  \n(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results\" below for more details.  \n---  \n  \n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nAs of October 6, 2024, Red Robin had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $187.9 million and liquidity of approximately $42.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under its credit facility.\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our credit agreement (the \"Second Amendment\"). The Second Amendment among other things: provides certain relief by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio covenant beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025; increases the aggregate revolving commitments by $15.0 million to $40.0 million through the third quarter of 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term loans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to 7.50% per annum and that are ABR-based loans to 6.50% per annum; and adds additional reporting requirements.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to our credit agreement (the \"Third Amendment\") which extended the terms of the Second Amendment through the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe Second Amendment and Third Amendment provide additional flexibility to support the Company's execution of its North Star business strategy. Additional information on the terms of the Second Amendment and Third Amendment can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Outlook for Fiscal 2024 and Guidance Policy**\n\nThe Company provides guidance of select information related to its financial and operating performance, and such measures may differ from year to year. The projections are as of this date and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement this information.\n\nThe Company's updated guidance for fiscal 2024 is:\n\n  * Total revenue of approximately $1.250 billion;\n  * Restaurant level operating profit of at least 10.5%, inclusive of investments in the Guest experience and rent expense related to the sale leaseback transactions;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $35.0 million to $37.5 million;\n  * Capital expenditures of approximately $25 million.\n\n\n\nFiscal 2024 includes 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2023.\n\nProviding Income (loss) from operations and Net income (loss) guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and other non-core operating items. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures.\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nRed Robin will host an investor conference call to discuss financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024 and outlook for fiscal 2024 today at 4:30 p.m. ET.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per share-diluted are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures give the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company, and are intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per share-diluted exclude the impact of non-operating or nonrecurring items including changes in estimates, asset impairments, litigation contingencies, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, restaurant and office closure costs, gains on sale leaseback transactions, severance and executive transition costs and other non-recurring, non-cash or discrete items; net of income tax impacts. Other companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently, and as a result may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Management believes this supplemental information will assist with comparisons of past and future financial results against the present financial results presented herein.\n\nThe Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less franchise revenue and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs, selling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, pre-opening costs, as well as, other charges (gains), net because these costs are non-operating or nonrecurring and therefore not related to the ongoing operations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income (loss) from operations as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the Company's industry.\n\n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share -

Ultimately, we believe we are on the right path to\ndrive sustainable long-term growth and return this beloved brand to prominence in the\nindustry.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Summary\nThe following table presents financial results for the fiscal third quarter and year to date\nperiods of 2024, compared to results from the same periods in 2023 ($ in millions except per\nshare data):\nTwelve Weeks Ended Forty Weeks Ended\nOctober 6, October 1, October 6, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenues $ 274.6 $ 277.6 $ 963.3 $ 994.0\nRestaurant revenues 270.6 273.1 943.6 973.3\nNet income (loss) (18.9) (8.2) (37.8) (7.5)\nIncome (loss) from operations (12.9) (1.9) (19.6) 12.5\nIncome (loss) from operations as a percent of total\nrevenues (4.7) % (0.7) % (2.0) % 1.3 %\nRestaurant Level Operating Profit(1) $ 24.2 $ 30.4 $ 100.4 $ 127.2\nRestaurant Level Operating Profit Margin(1) 9.0 % 11.1 % 10.6 % 13.1 %\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) $ 2.1 $ 6.8 $ 26.1 $ 58.3\nNet income (loss) per diluted share $ (1.20) $ (0.52) $ (2.42) $ (0.47)\nAdjusted income (loss) per diluted share(1) $ (1.13) $ (0.79) $ (2.39) $ (0.78)\n(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results\" below for more details.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of October 6, 2024, Red Robin had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of\n$187.9 million and liquidity of approximately $42.0 million, including cash and cash\nequivalents and available borrowing capacity under its credit facility.\nOn August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our credit\nagreement (the \"Second Amendment\"). The Second Amendment among other things:\nprovides certain relief by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio covenant\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025; increases the\naggregate revolving commitments by $15.0 million to $40.0 million through the third quarter\nof 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term\nloans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to 7.50% per annum and that are\nABR-based loans to 6.50% per annum; and adds additional reporting requirements.\nOn November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to our credit\nagreement (the \"Third Amendment\") which extended the terms of the Second Amendment\nthrough the first quarter of 2026.\nThe Second Amendment and Third Amendment provide additional flexibility to support the\nCompany's execution of its North Star business strategy. Additional information on the terms\nof the Second Amendment and Third Amendment can be found in the Company's Form 10-\nQ for the third quarter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2024 and Guidance Policy\nThe Company provides guidance of select information related to its financial and operating\nperformance, and such measures may differ from year to year. The projections are as of this\ndate and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement this information.\nThe Company's updated guidance for fiscal 2024 is:\nTotal revenue of approximately $1.250 billion;\nRestaurant level operating profit of at least 10.5%, inclusive of investments in the\nGuest experience and rent expense related to the sale leaseback transactions;\nAdjusted EBITDA of $35.0 million to $37.5 million;\nCapital expenditures of approximately $25 million.\nFiscal 2024 includes 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2023.\nProviding Income (loss) from operations and Net income (loss) guidance is potentially\nmisleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and\nother non-core operating items. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted\nnon-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nRed Robin will host an investor conference call to discuss financial results for its third quarter\nof fiscal 2024 and outlook for fiscal 2024 today at 4:30 p.m. ET.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before\ninterest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA,\nAdjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per share-diluted are\nsupplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in\naccordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures give the reader additional\ninsight into the ongoing operational results of the Company, and are intended to supplement\nthe presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted\nEBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per share-diluted\nexclude the impact of non-operating or nonrecurring items including changes in estimates,\nasset impairments, litigation contingencies, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment,\nrestaurant and office closure costs, gains on sale leaseback transactions, severance and\nexecutive transition costs and other non-recurring, non-cash or discrete items; net of income\ntax impacts. Other companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently, and as a\nresult may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Management believes\nthis supplemental information will assist with comparisons of past and future financial results\nagainst the present financial results presented herein.\nThe Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for\nmanagement and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a\nuseful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance.\nThe Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less\nfranchise revenue and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs,\nselling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The\nmeasure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage\nrents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general\nliability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization\nexpense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such\nexpenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the\nrestaurants. The measure also excludes costs associated with selling, general, and\nadministrative functions, pre-opening costs, as well as, other charges (gains), net because\nthese costs are non-operating or nonrecurring and therefore not related to the ongoing\noperations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an\nalternative, to income (loss) from operations as an indicator of financial performance.\nRestaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled\nmeasures of other companies in the Company's industry.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share -\nDiluted\n(In thousands, except per share data, unaudited)\nTwelve Weeks Ended Forty Weeks Ended\nOctober 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023\nNet income (loss) as reported $ (18,876) $ (8,161) $ (37,825) $ (7,496)\nOther Charges (gains), net:\nGain on sale of restaurant property — (14,883) (7,425) (29,413)\nLitigation contingencies 271 3,600 1,047 9,140\nRestaurant closure costs, net (175) (91) 422 1,546\nSeverance and executive transition 22 341 1,104 3,195\nAsset impairment 178 4,800 1,306 7,187\nAsset disposal and other, net 1,179 277 3,799 1,366\nClosed corporate office costs, net of sublease income 57 78 234 253\nIncome tax effect (398) 1,528 (127) 1,749\nAdjusted net income (loss) $ (17,742) $ (12,511) $ (37,465) $ (12,473)\nIncome (loss) per share - diluted:\nNet income (loss) as reported $ (1.20) $ (0.52) $ (2.42) $ (0.47)\nOther charges (gains), net:\nGain on sale of restaurant property — (0.94) (0.47) (1.84)\nLitigation contingencies 0.02 0.23 0.07 0.57\nRestaurant closure costs, net (0.01) (0.01) 0.03 0.10\nSeverance and executive transition — 0.02 0.07 0.20\nAsset impairment 0.01 0.30 0.08 0.45\nAsset disposal and other, net 0.07 0.02 0.24 0.09\nClosed corporate office costs, net of sublease income — — 0.01 0.02\nIncome tax effect (0.03) 0.10 (0.01) 0.11\nAdjusted income (loss) per share - diluted\n(1.13) (0.79) (2.39) (0.78)\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic 15,754 15,799 15,652 15,949\nDiluted 15,754 15,799 15,652 15,949\nReconciliation of Income (Loss) from Operations to Non-GAAP Restaurant-Level Operating Profit\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nTwelve Weeks Ended Forty Weeks Ended\nOctober 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023\n$\nIncome (loss) from operations (12,877) (4.7) % $ (1,938) (0.7) % $ (19,551) (2.0) % $ 12,498 1.3 %\nLess:\nFranchise revenue 3,007 1.1 % 3,418 1.2 % 12,635 1.3 % 12,245 1.2 %\nOther revenue 1,026 0.4 % 1,009 0.4 % 7,068 0.7 % 8,468 0.9 %\nAdd:\nOther charges (gains), net 1,532 0.6 % (5,878) (2.1) % 487 0.1 % (6,726) (0.7) %\nPre-opening costs — — % — — % — — % 586 0.1 %\nSelling 5,467 2.0 % 9,418 3.4 % 31,052 3.2 % 24,547 2.5 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 20,823 7.6 % 18,543 6.7 % 63,277 6.6 % 64,801 6.5 %\nDepreciation and amortization 13,330 4.9 % 14,672 5.3 % 44,886 4.7 % 52,253 5.3 %\nRestaurant-level operating profit $24,242 9.0 % $30,390 11.1 % $100,448 10.6 % $127,246 13.1 %\nIncome (loss) from operations as a\npercentage of total\nrevenues\n(4.7) % (0.7) % (2.0) % 1.3 %\nRestaurant-level operating profit\nmargin (as a\npercentage of restaurant revenue) 9.0 % 11.1 % 10.6 % 13.1 %\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nTwelve Weeks Ended Forty Weeks Ended\nOctober 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023\nNet income (loss) as reported $ (18,876) $ (8,161) $ (37,825) $ (7,496)\nInterest expense, net 6,193 5,885 18,504 19,766\nIncome tax provision (benefit) (98) 278 43 453\nDepreciation and amortization 13,330 14,672 44,886 52,253\nEBITDA 549 12,674 25,608 64,976\nOther charges (gains), net:\nGain on sale of restaurant property — (14,883) (7,425) (29,413)\nLitigation contingencies 271 3,600 1,047 9,140\nRestaurant closure costs (gains), net (175) (91) 422 1,546\nSeverance and executive transition 22 341 1,104 3,195\nAsset impairment 178 4,800 1,306 7,187\nAsset disposal and other, net 1,179 277 3,799 1,366\nClosed corporate office costs, net of sublease income 57 78 234 253\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 2,081 $ 6,796 $ 26,095 $ 58,250\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/red-robin-gourmet-\nburgers-inc-reports-results-for-the-fiscal-third-quarter-ended-october-6-2024-\n302297949.html\nSOURCE Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc."
