Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Business Updates\n\nNovember 4, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9731/pdf)\n\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. (UNITY) [NASDAQ:UBX], a biotechnology company developing therapeutics to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“As recently discussed on our Ophthalmology Day for investors and analysts, diabetic macular edema represents a large underserved market due to inadequate response to anti-VEGF standard of care, continued vision loss over time despite treatment, and high treatment burden leading to discontinuation,” said Anirvan Ghosh, Ph.D., chief executive officer of UNITY. “We believe that UBX1325 (foselutoclax) with its novel mechanism of action has the potential to improve long-term visual outcomes for DME patients, via a proven and safe intravitreal route of administration. We believe that the readouts from the Phase 2b ASPIRE study comparing UBX1325 to the aflibercept standard of care will provide a definitive dataset to inform the design of a potential pivotal study.”\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, UNITY had a Type C interaction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regarding the development of UBX1325 (foselutoclax) for DME. Based on that interaction, UNITY expects that a pivotal study would need to be a non-inferiority trial comparing UBX1325 to an approved anti-VEGF agent such as aflibercept. The endpoint for regulatory approval is expected to be an assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as assessed by the ETDRS scale with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters.\n\nThe webcast presentation from the Company’s Ophthalmology Investor and Analyst Day is available [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ivVIxJlZyxcQdg58FkG5uTUOnK8YF3zNpjLuE-K3S4N4Fpp9u35XdScxbdv4pFz7KSz7TqPzzx0tP_mLhNkVD-_YBZ4vTPFJw5AsJHzf7v4=).\n\nUBX1325 (foselutoclax) is designed as a novel and durable therapeutic option in diabetic macular edema (DME) that acts via a senolytic mechanism of action, with the potential to address shortcomings of the current standard of care, such as high treatment burden and sub-optimal response to treatment.\n\nUNITY expects topline 24-week primary endpoint data in the first quarter of 2025 and 36-week data in the second quarter of 2025. The Phase 2b ASPIRE study in DME is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UBX1325 in a head-to-head comparison to aflibercept. More information about ASPIRE (NCT06011798) can be found [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ivVIxJlZyxcQdg58FkG5uYTdhravw0MyHvqQE2HvgDnQY8Z-jdvZ9huszjUT_FhlUjd5J1yJHe_NmcVFHs8VBWCxsNnmqtf1xeM5A8RRoZ8mVpPt7QbSxIiXkRbzmQD-).\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $29.0 million as of September 30, 2024 compared with $43.2 million as of December 31, 2023. UNITY believes that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund operations into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $6.5 million compared to $14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operations during the first, second and third quarters of 2024 was $15.0 million compared to $29.5 million during the first, second, and third quarters of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $1.8 million, to $2.8 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, from $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to $0.9 million in personnel costs due to our reduced headcount related to our reduction in force, $0.8 million in direct research and development expenses mainly due to the completion of the Phase 2 BEHOLD study of UBX1325 in patients with DME and the Phase 2 ENVISION study of UBX1325 in patients with AMD, and $0.1 million in operating costs due to reduced fixed assets depreciation and reduced office space.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million, to $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $0.5 million in personnel-related expenses due to reduced headcount and the reduction in bonus and severance amounts paid as compared to 2023 and $0.1 million in operating costs mainly from the continuation of sublease income generated from the East Grand property, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million in professional fees and accounting service fees.\n\n**About UNITY**\n\nUNITY is developing a new class of therapeutics to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. UNITY’s current focus is on creating medicines to selectively eliminate or modulate senescent cells and thereby provide transformative benefit in age-related ophthalmologic and neurologic diseases.

He also performs macular hole and macular pucker surgeries (conditions that cause blurred or distorted vision), retinal detachment and complications of diabetic eye disease. Dr. Bhisitkul recruits patients to participate in UCSF clinical trials of novel therapies for macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, and also for studies on long-term outcomes for treatments such as surgically implantable devices that deliver medication. He has published more than 60 papers in clinical and scientific journals.\n\n**Arshad M. Khanani , M.D., MA, FASRS**Arshad M. Khanani, M.D., MA, FASRS, is a Managing Partner, Director of Clinical Research, and Director of Fellowship at Sierra Eye Associates and Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Khanani founded the clinical research department at Sierra Eye Associates, which is now one of the leading clinical research centers in the country. He has served as a principal investigator for over 100 clinical trials and has been a top enroller in the country for multiple Phase 1-3 trials. In addition, Dr. Khanani was the first to perform surgical procedures in multiple surgical clinical trials dealing with sustained delivery and gene therapy. He has published over 75 scientific publications and is a frequent guest speaker at national and international meetings.\n\n**Dante Pieramici , M.D.**Dante Pieramici, M.D. is currently a managing partner of the California Retina Consultants and a member of the Medical Leadership Board of the Retina Consultants of America.\n\nAs the Medical Director of Clinical Research at California Retina Consultants, Dr. Pieramici has served as the principal or sub investigator, reading center investigator or advisor for over 100 clinical trials. His research has focused primarily on new surgical and pharmacologic treatments for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic related eye diseases. He has served as a consultant for numerous biotech companies, helping to design, monitor and evaluate clinical trial results for retinal diseases. He has authored over 150 peer-reviewed research papers and book chapters on retinal diseases and has served as editor for the text, Ocular Trauma: Principles and Practice.\n\nDr. Pieramici currently serves as President of the California Retina Research Foundation and serves as a long-time board member at S.E.E International.\n\n**About UBX1325** UBX1325 is an investigational compound being studied in retinal diseases, including DME, and is not approved for any use in any country. UBX1325 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of BCL-xL, a member of the BCL-2 family of apoptosis regulating proteins. UBX1325 is designed to inhibit the function of proteins that senescent cells rely on for survival. The Phase 2 BEHOLD study in patients with DME demonstrated that a single injection of UBX1325 resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in mean BCVA through 48 weeks compared to sham treatment. In preclinical studies, UNITY has demonstrated that targeting BCL-xL with UBX1325 preferentially eliminated senescent cells from diseased tissue while sparing cells in healthy tissue. UNITY’s goal with UBX1325 is to transformationally improve real-world outcomes for patients with retinal disease.\n\n**About UNITY** UNITY is developing a new class of therapeutics to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. UNITY’s current focus is on creating medicines to selectively eliminate or modulate senescent cells and thereby provide transformative benefit in age-related ophthalmologic and neurologic diseases.

Throughout most of human history, you had a roughly 50–50 chance of making it into your twenties, mainly due to deaths from infectious diseases and accidents. Thanks to medical advances, we’ve gradually found ways to avoid and treat such causes of death; the end result is perhaps humanity’s greatest ever achievement—we’ve literally doubled what it means to be human, increasing lifespans from 40 to 80 years. On the other hand, this has allowed one scourge to rise above all the others to become the world’s largest cause of death: aging.\n\nAging is now responsible for over two-thirds of deaths globally—more than 100,000 people every day. This is because, counterintuitive though it may sound, the chief risk factor for most of the modern world’s leading killers is the aging process itself: Cancer, heart disease, dementia, and many more health problems become radically more common as we get older. We all know that factors such as smoking, lack of exercise, and poor diet can increase the risk of chronic diseases, but these are relatively minor compared to aging. For instance, having high blood pressure doubles your risk of having a heart attack; being 80 rather than 40 years old multiplies your risk by ten. As the global population ages, the magnitude of death and suffering caused by aging will only increase.\n\nBut this isn’t my prediction—apart from being depressing, extrapolating a two-century trend for a further year is hardly groundbreaking. What’s far more exciting is that, in 2023, we may see the first drug that targets the biology of aging itself.\n\nScientists now have a good handle on what causes us to age, biologically speaking: The so-called “hallmarks” of the aging process range from damage to our DNA—the instruction manual within each of our cells—to proteins that misbehave because of alterations to their chemical structure. Most excitingly, we now have ideas of how to treat them.\n\nBy the end of 2023, it’s likely that one of these ideas will be shown to work in humans. One strong contender is “senolytics,” a class of treatments that targets aged cells—which biologists call senescent cells—that accumulate in our bodies as we age. These cells seem to drive the aging process—from causing cancers to neurodegeneration—and, conversely, removing them seems to slow it down, and perhaps even reverse it.\n\nA 2018 paper showed that in experiments in which mice were given a senolytic cocktail of dasatinib (a cancer drug) and quercetin (a molecule found in colorful fruit and veg), not only did they live longer, but they were at lower risk of diseases including cancer, were less frail (they could run further and faster on the tiny mouse-sized treadmills used in the experiments), and even had thicker, glossier fur than their littermates not given the drugs.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * [![The WalkingPad C2 Mini Treadmill Feels Stable Under Your Desk and Feet](https://media.wired.com/photos/673e619beeecd9d327616b91/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined)](https://www.wired.com/review/walkingpad-c2/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nGear\n\n[The WalkingPad C2 Mini Treadmill Feels Stable Under Your Desk and Feet](https://www.wired.com/review/walkingpad-c2/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nBy Kristin Canning\n\n  * [![The Insta360 Link 2 Is a Great-Value Motorized Webcam](https://media.wired.com/photos/673cf0296a6dcbad027c6545/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined)](https://www.wired.com/review/review-insta360-link-2/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\n[The Insta360 Link 2 Is a Great-Value Motorized Webcam](https://www.wired.com/review/review-insta360-link-2/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nBy Sam Kieldsen\n\n  * [![The Clip Converts Your Regular Bike Into an Electrified Ride](https://media.wired.com/photos/673a1ca0b3ac5023336b49dd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined)](https://www.wired.com/review/clip-ebike-conversion-kit/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nGear\n\n[The Clip Converts Your Regular Bike Into an Electrified Ride](https://www.wired.com/review/clip-ebike-conversion-kit/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nBy Stephanie Pearson\n\n  * [![This Lenovo 2-in-1 Laptop Is Affordable, but Lacking in Performance and Battery Life](https://media.wired.com/photos/6737c2d8f7a4cdc92545beb3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined)](https://www.wired.com/review/lenovo-ideapad-5x-2-in-1-gen-9-14-inch/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nGear\n\n[This Lenovo 2-in-1 Laptop Is Affordable, but Lacking in Performance and Battery Life](https://www.wired.com/review/lenovo-ideapad-5x-2-in-1-gen-9-14-inch/#intcid=_wired-right-rail_f08a132c-375a-4b00-8775-2e51fbc11eae_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi)\n\nBy Christopher Null\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than two dozen companies looking for safe and effective ways to get rid of these senescent cells in people. The biggest is Unity Biotechnology, founded by the Mayo Clinic scientists behind that mouse experiment and with investors including Jeff Bezos, which is trialing a range of senolytic drugs against diseases like macular degeneration (a cause of blindness) and lung fibrosis. There are many approaches under investigation, including small proteins that target senescent cells, vaccines to encourage the immune system to clear them out, and even gene therapy by a company called Oisín Biotechnologies, named after an Irish mythological character who travels to Tir na nÓg, the land of eternal youth.\n\nSenolytics aren’t the only contenders, either: Others currently in human trials include Proclara Biosciences’ protein GAIM, which clears up sticky “amyloid” proteins, or Verve Therapeutics’ gene therapy to reduce cholesterol by modifying a gene called PCSK9. The first true anti-aging medicine will very likely target a specific age-related disease driven by a particular hallmark, rather than aging writ large. But the success of a drug targeting an aspect of aging in clinical trials will allow us to consider this loftier goal in the not-too-distant future.\n\nIn 2023, early success of these treatments could kickstart the greatest revolution in medicine since the discovery of antibiotics. Rather than going to the doctor when we’re sick and picking off age-related problems like cancer and dementia in their late stages when they’re very hard to fix, we’ll intervene preventively to stop people getting ill in the first place—and, if those treadmill-shredding mice are anything to go by, we’ll reduce frailty and other problems that don’t always elicit a medical diagnosis at the same time.\n\n## You Might Also Like …\n\n  * **In your inbox:** A new series of tips for [how to use AI every day](https://www.wired.com/newsletter/ai-unlocked?sourceCode=BottomStories)\n\n  * Meet [the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams](https://www.wired.com/story/meet-zachxbt-243-million-crypto-theft/)\n\n  * **Deep dive:** This app set out to fight pesticides.
