(Nasdaq: ECX) (“ECARX” or the “Company”), a global mobility tech provider, today announced unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nZiyu Shen, ECARX Chairman and CEO, commented, “The solid growth momentum we picked up in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter with the market continuing to yield significant opportunities for us despite global headwinds. Revenue increased by 31% year-over-year, with 442,000 vehicles incorporating ECARX technology hitting the road this quarter alone, underscoring our unique positioning to drive growth in China and overseas, regardless of market cycle. Our evolving product portfolio, diverse customer base, and global partnerships and operations are key factors that enable us to capitalize on these opportunities.”\n\n“Competition remains fierce with ongoing pricing pressures, which caused gross margins to fall to 17% during the quarter. We have always focused on the long-term strategy of our business and believe this will only be temporary since we already implemented several initiatives to optimize our cost structure and improve margins. Our strategies have not changed, and we remain dedicated to these strategies with our top line continuing to outperform the broader market as we scale and build a path towards profitability. Our pipeline remains healthy and robust with products for over 40 vehicle models currently under development, a testament to the fact that our versatile technologies are being replicated at an accelerated pace and scale across various brands and models. Our expertise in commercializing and deploying these integrated vehicle solutions on a global scale allow us to lower costs and reduce go-to-market time for manufacturers around the world.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Total revenue** was RMB1,425.3 million (US$203.1 million), up 31% year-over-year (“YoY”).\n    * **Sales of goods revenue** was RMB1,179.9 million (US$168.1 million), up 61% YoY, primarily driven by continued growth in global demand, and an increase in the sales volume of Antora series and Makalu platform digital cockpits, and autonomous driving control units (ADCU), which contributed approximately 23% and 11% to the total revenue from sales of goods, respectively.\n    * **Software license revenue** was RMB84.0 million (US$12.0 million), down 39% YoY, primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales volume of navigation and operating software compared to the same period last year.\n    * **Service revenue** was RMB161.4 million (US$23.0 million), down 26% YoY, principally as a result of lower number and value of contracts completed during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year.\n  * **Total cost of revenue** was RMB1,177.8 million (US$167.8 million), up 55% YoY, primarily driven by an increase in the sales volume of digital cockpits and ADCU.\n  * **Gross profit** was RMB247.5 million (US$35.3 million), down 25% YoY, which resulted in a gross margin of 17%. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to the penetration pricing strategy adopted to drive automotive computing platform revenue growth, as well as change in the total revenue mix compared to the same period last year.\n  * **Research and development expenses** were RMB344.2 million (US$49.0 million), up 11% YoY, primarily driven by ongoing investments in the Company’s core product roadmap and technologies.\n  * **Selling, general and administrative expenses and others, net** were RMB211.6 million (US$30.2 million), down 19% YoY, primarily attributable to improved global operating efficiencies and lower share-based compensation expenses during the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **Net loss** was RMB340.0 million (US$48.4 million), compared with RMB283.1 million during the same period last year, primarily attributable to lower gross margin generated with penetration pricing adoption and lower foreign currency exchange gain, partially offset by the decrease in total operating expenses and the change in fair value of derivative and equity security compared to the same period last year.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA**(non-GAAP) loss was RMB232.6 million (US$33.1 million), compared with adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) loss of RMB180.5 million in the same period last year. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measure, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\n  * **Total cash** as of September 30, 2024 was RMB688.4 million (US$98.1 million) including RMB43.4 million of restricted cash.\n  * During this quarter, the Company acquired a controlling financial interest in Hubei Dongjun Automotive Electronic Technology Co., Ltd (“Hubei Dongjun”).

The co-founders are two automotive entrepreneurs, Chairman and CEO Ziyu Shen, and Eric Li (Li Shufu), who is also the founder and chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group — with ownership interests in global brands including Lotus, Lynk & Co, Geely Galaxy, Polestar, smart, and Volvo Cars. ECARX also works with other well-known automakers, including FAW and Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën. To date, ECARX products can be found in over 7.3 million vehicles worldwide.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management’s beliefs and expectations as well as on assumptions made by and data currently available to management, appear in a number of places throughout this document and include statements regarding, amongst other things, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, and the industry in which we operate. The use of words “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “believes,” “should,” “potential,” “may,” “preliminary,” “forecast,” “objective,” “plan,” or “target,” and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, or current expectations concerning, among other things, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, future market conditions or economic performance and developments in the capital and credit markets and expected future financial performance, and the markets in which we operate.\n\nFor a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, see ECARX’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ECARX undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law.\n\n**Translation of results into U.S. dollars**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi (RMB) amounts into U.S. dollars (US$) at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, the translation of RMB into US$ has been made at RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on September 30, 2024 as set forth in the H.10 Statistical Release of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. We make no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, or at all.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nThe Company uses adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation expenses.\n\nThe Company presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by the management to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measure helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effects of certain expenses that are included in net loss. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitates investors’ assessment of its operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to net loss or any other measures of performance or as indicators of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to compare the Company’s historical adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data. The Company encourages investors and others to review the financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**Investor Contacts:** Rene Duir@ecarxgroup.com\n\n**Media Contacts:** ecarx@christensencomms.com\n\nECARX Holdings Inc.Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  \n---  \n**As of****December 31,****2023**| **As of****September 30, 2024**  \nMillions, except otherwise noted| **RMB**| **RMB**| **USD**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets**  \nCash| 571.8| 645.0| 91.9  \nRestricted cash| 27.1| 43.4| 6.2  \nShort-term investments| 137.9| 124.2| 17.7  \nAccounts receivable – third parties, net| 285.8| 205.3| 29.3  \nAccounts receivable – related parties, net| 1,572.7| 1,123.3| 160.1  \nNotes receivable| 54.6| 35.5| 5.1  \nInventories| 160.8| 237.2| 33.8  \nAmounts due from related parties| 74.1| 55.6| 7.9  \nPrepayments and other current assets| 443.6| 371.4| 52.8  \n**Total current assets**| **3,328.4**| **2,840.9**| **404.8**  \n**Non-current assets**  \nLong-term investments| 301.0| 37.7| 5.4  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| 125.2| 144.7| 20.6  \nProperty and equipment, net| 120.8| 165.9| 23.6  \nIntangible assets, net| 179.3| 288.3| 41.1  \nGoodwill| —| 25.7| 3.7  \nOther non-current assets – third parties| 28.2| 23.8| 3.4  \nOther non-current assets – related parties| 224.3| 277.6| 39.6  \n**Total non-current assets**| **978.8**| **963.7**| **137.4**  \n**Total assets**| **4,307.2**| **3,804.6**| **542.2**  \n**LIABILITIES**  \n**Current liabilities**  \nShort-term borrowings| 1,200.0| 1,607.1| 229.0  \nAccounts payable -
