(Nasdaq: FBIO) (“Fortress”), an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holdings and dividend and royalty revenue, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nLindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are thrilled to have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for Emrosi™, a potential best-in-class treatment for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, which is a tremendous milestone for Fortress and our partner company, Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey Medical”). This marks the first FDA approval across the Fortress portfolio, and demonstrates our ability to successfully in-license a clinical stage program and develop it through commercialization. We could achieve up to two more U.S. FDA approvals in the next nine months, and our next anticipated PDUFA goal date is December 28, 2024, for cosibelimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”). We have an exciting late-stage pipeline with many upcoming value creation opportunities, and we are focused on attaining our long-term strategy of building shareholder value, while bringing innovative treatment options to patients with unmet medical needs.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights****1****:**\n\n_Regulatory Updates_\n\n  * In November 2024, the FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29. Emrosi has the potential to be the new treatment paradigm for the millions of patients suffering from inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is expected to launch late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2025 by our partner company, Journey Medical (Nasdaq: DERM).\n  * In July 2024, the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024. Cosibelimab is currently in development at our partner company, Checkpoint Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CKPT) (“Checkpoint”).\n  * In December 2023, we completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl Therapeutics (“Sentynl”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl completed the rolling submission of the New Drug Application for CUTX-101 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cyprium Therapeutics (“Cyprium”), our subsidiary company that developed CUTX-101, will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101. \n\n\n\n_Clinical Updates_\n\n  * In October 2024, clinical data were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In September 2024, we presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. The longer-term results for cosibelimab demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.\n\n\n\n_Other Updates_\n\n  * In July 2024, we announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, our majority owned and controlled subsidiary company, Urica Therapeutics (“Urica”), entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement and related agreements with Crystalys Therapeutics (“Crystalys”). Urica transferred rights to dotinurad, its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity and granted Urica a securitized 3% royalty on future net sales of dotinurad.\n\n\n\n_Commercial Product Updates_\n\n  * Journey Medical’s net product revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $14.6 million, compared to net product revenues of $14.9 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**General Corporate:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint raised $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules.\n  * In July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue in accordance with their terms; the pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the suspension should be lifted.\n  * Also in July 2024, Fortress reduced its total debt by entering into a new loan agreement maturing in July 2027 with funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), a leading global investment firm. The Company received an initial tranche of $35 million and is eligible to draw an additional $15 million with Oaktree’s consent. In connection with the new loan agreement, the Company repaid its prior term loan with Oaktree of $50 million resulting in an outstanding debt reduction of approximately $15 million of debt excluding accrued interest and prepayment fees.\n  * In September 2024, Fortress raised $8 million in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements.\n  * In October 2024, Mustang Bio raised $4 million in gross proceeds from the exercise of existing warrants.\n  * In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in gross proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, Fortress’ consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $58.9 million, compared to $76.2 million as of June 30, 2024, and compared to $80.9 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $17.3 million during the quarter and a decrease of $22.0 million year-to-date.\n  * Fortress’ consolidated cash and cash equivalents, totaling $58.9 million as of September 30, 2024, includes $25.6 million attributable to Fortress and the private subsidiaries, $2.6 million attributable to Avenue, $4.7 million attributable to Checkpoint, $3.5 million attributable to Mustang Bio and $22.5 million attributable to Journey Medical. \n    * Fortress’ consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $80.9 million as of December 31, 2023, which included $40.6 million attributable to Fortress and private subsidiaries, $1.8 million attributable to Avenue, $4.9 million attributable to Checkpoint, $6.2 million attributable to Mustang Bio and $27.4 million attributable to Journey Medical.\n  * Fortress’ consolidated net revenue totaled $14.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, all of which was generated from our marketed dermatology products. This compares to consolidated revenue totaling $34.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, which included $15.3 million in revenue generated from our marketed dermatology products and an upfront license agreement payment of $19 million.\n  * Consolidated research and development expenses including license acquisitions totaled $9.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.3 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Consolidated selling, general and administrative costs were $22.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(15.0) million, or $(0.76) per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(7.1) million, or $(0.94) per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**About Fortress Biotech** Fortress Biotech, Inc.

(Nasdaq: ATXI) (“Avenue” or the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We have generated considerable momentum this past quarter in advancing our pipeline of innovative treatments for neurologic diseases,” said Alexandra MacLean, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Avenue. “AJ201 is a potential best-in-class asset that would bring a disease-modifying therapeutic option to patients with significant unmet medical need in Kennedy’s Disease. Since dosing the last patient in the study in May, we continue to work diligently to move the study forward. We are looking forward to sharing topline clinical data in the coming months and building upon our progress of delivering impactful therapies to patients suffering from neurologic diseases.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n**AJ201** _(Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer for SBMA)_\n\n  * In May 2024, Avenue announced the last patient visit was complete in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), marking the final clinical milestone ahead of the anticipated topline data announcement around year-end 2024. The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 enrolled 25 patients randomly assigned to AJ201 (600 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess safety and tolerability of AJ201 in subjects with clinically and genetically defined SBMA. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data measuring change from baseline in mutant AR protein levels in skeletal muscle and changes from baseline in expression of Nrf2-activated genes in skeletal muscle. Exploratory objectives of the study include changes in the fat and muscle composition as seen on MRI scans. These endpoints are believed to be biomarkers indicating likelihood for longer term clinical improvement. Further details about this study can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05517603). \n\n\n\n**BAER-101** _(GABA_ _A_ _α2/3 positive allosteric modulator)_\n\n  * Subject to the receipt of additional financing, Avenue plans to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of BAER-101 in patients with focal epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Preclinical mouse models have demonstrated BAER-101 as a therapeutic option with the ability to fully suppress seizure activity, with the effect being fast in onset and stable throughout the duration of testing. \n\n\n\n**IV Tramadol**\n\n  * Avenue has reached final agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on the safety study protocol and statistical analysis approach for the Phase 3 study of intravenous (“IV”) tramadol, which is being developed for the treatment of acute post-operative pain in a medically supervised setting. The proposed study will randomize approximately 300 post bunionectomy patients to IV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Patients will have access to IV hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain. Avenue aims to initiate the Phase 3 safety study pending additional financing or a partnership. The Company believes that the study can be completed and submitted to the FDA within 12 months of the study’s initiation. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 million, compared to $4.9 million at June 30, 2024 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $0.8 million year-to-date.\n  * **R &D Expenses: **Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.3 million, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **G &A Expenses: **General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.8 million, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $(3.1) million, or $(1.92) per share, compared to net income of $0.5 million, or $4.86 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Avenue Therapeutics** Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases. It is currently developing three assets including AJ201, a first-in-class asset for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, BAER-101, an oral small molecule selective GABAA α2, α3 receptor positive allosteric modulator for CNS diseases, and IV tramadol, which is in Phase 3 clinical development for the management of acute postoperative pain in adults in a medically supervised healthcare setting.

These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections made by management about our business, our industry and other conditions affecting our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause such outcomes and results to differ include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties arising from: the fact that we currently have no drug products for sale and that our success is dependent on our product candidates receiving regulatory approval and being successfully commercialized; the possibility that serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our current or future product candidates, such that we would need to abandon or limit development of some of our product candidates; our ability to successfully develop, partner, or commercialize any of our current or future product candidates including AJ201, IV tramadol, and BAER-101; the substantial doubt raised about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing; the significant losses we have incurred since inception and our expectation that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future; our need for substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which unavailability could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts; our reliance on third parties for several aspects of our operations; our reliance on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate, unreliable, or unacceptable to regulatory authorities; the possibility that we may not receive regulatory approval for any or all of our product candidates, or that such approval may be significantly delayed due to scientific or regulatory reasons; the fact that even if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, they will remain subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny; the effects of current and future laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations; the effects of competition for our product candidates and the potential for new products to emerge that provide different or better therapeutic alternatives for our targeted indications; the possibility that the government or third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our product candidates or any future products; our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates; our exposure to potential product liability claims; related to the protection of our intellectual property and our potential inability to maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products; our ability to maintain compliance with the obligations under our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, without which licenses and arrangements we could lose rights that are important to our business; the fact that Fortress Biotech, Inc. controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and has rights to receive significant share grants annually; and those risks discussed in our filings which we make with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this press release, except as required by applicable law.

(“Checkpoint”) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate updates.\n\n“With the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date set for next month, we await the decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our anti-programmed death ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) antibody,” said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. “The $9.2 million in cash proceeds received this month from the exercise of existing warrants has strengthened our balance sheet to extend beyond our PDUFA date and into 2025. We are now fully focused on preparing for the potential approval of cosibelimab and look forward to potentially offering oncologists a new, differentiated treatment option for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”).”\n\n**Recent Corporate Updates:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint announced that the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab as a complete response to the complete response letter (“CRL”) issued in December 2023 and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab, its anti-PD-L1 antibody with dual mechanism of action, with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint completed a registered direct offering priced At-the-Market under Nasdaq rules and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million.\n  * In September 2024, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from its pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses. A copy of the ESMO poster can be found on the [Publications page](https://checkpointtx.com/publications/) of Checkpoint’s website.\n  * In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.7 million, compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million for the quarter and a decrease of $0.2 million, year-to-date. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n  * **R &D Expenses**: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.4 million, compared to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.9 million. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included $0.5 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **G &A Expenses**: General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.4 million, compared to $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $1.2 million. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included $1.4 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $9.7 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included $1.9 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Checkpoint Therapeutics** Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers.

For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our resubmission of our BLA for cosibelimab and review thereof, our belief that the BLA resubmission potentially addresses all the issues in the CRL, our belief about the comprehensive nature of our BLA resubmission and reaching alignment with the FDA on our cosibelimab BLA resubmission strategy, our ability to work with our third-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) and the FDA to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL and execute on a pathway forward for the potential marketing approval of cosibelimab, the adequacy of the responses to the inspection issues submitted to FDA by our third-party CMO, our projections of regulatory review timelines, the commercial potential of cosibelimab, if approved, and the potential differentiation of cosibelimab, including a potentially favorable safety profile as compared to the currently available anti-programmed death receptor-1 therapies and the dual mechanism of action of cosibelimab translating into potential enhanced efficacy. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include the following: the risks and uncertainties associated with the regulatory review process; uncertainties regarding the timeline of FDA review of the resubmitted BLA; any inability to successfully work with the FDA to find a satisfactory solution to address any concerns in a timely manner or at all during the review process for the BLA, including any inability to provide the FDA with data, analysis or other information sufficient to support an approval of the BLA; our, and our third party CMO’s, ability to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL; issues associated with any facility inspection or re-inspection of our third party CMO or otherwise during the review process for the BLA; the risk that our third-party CMO will not meet deadlines, and/or comply with applicable regulations; whether the FDA accepts the data and results as included in the BLA resubmission at levels consistent with the published results, or at all; our ability to execute a partnering or other relationship to enable the commercialization of cosibelimab, if approved, on acceptable terms, if at all; the risk that topline and interim data remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the topline or interim data we previously published; the risk that safety issues or trends will be observed in the clinical trial when the full safety dataset is available and analyzed; the risk that a positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met; risks that regulatory authorities will not accept an application for approval of cosibelimab based on data from the Phase 1 clinical trial; the risk that the clinical results from the Phase 1 clinical trial will not support regulatory approval of cosibelimab to treat cSCC or, if approved, that cosibelimab will not be commercially successful; risks related to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks related to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic agreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other uncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-party suppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition; unfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the milestones we project, including the risk that the evolving and unpredictable Russia/Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic delay achievement of those milestones. Further discussion about these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, and in our subsequent other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

This approval is a transformational milestone for both Journey Medical and the dermatology community, as Emrosi has the potential to become the best-in-class oral medication and standard of care to address inflammatory lesions of rosacea.”\n\nMr. Maraoui continued, “We also continued to commercialize our core dermatology products and experienced a solid third quarter of 2024, with $14.6 million in revenues. We look forward to continued growth with the anticipated launch of Emrosi in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.”\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * Total net product revenues were $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Qbrexza net product sales increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, from the same period in 2023, due to our focused marketing efforts and the expansion of our access and coverage platforms for the product offset by decreases in sales volume for the remainder of our products. \n  * Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driving a 6.0% increase in our gross product margin from 57.9% in the prior year quarter, to 63.9% for the third quarter of 2024. The gross margin increase was mainly due to inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease in product royalties from the same period in 2023. \n  * Research and development costs decreased by $1.4 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. \n  * Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million from the same period in 2023 mainly due to increases in non-cash share-based compensation expenses and overall selling and marketing expenses, including our pre-launch expenses for Emrosi. \n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, or $(0.12) per share basic and diluted, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $0.91 per share basic and $0.80 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Our non-GAAP results in the table below reflect Adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share basic and diluted, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million, or $1.13 per share basic and $0.99 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below under “ _Use of Non-GAAP Measures_.” \n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $23.9 million at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * In November 2024, the U.S. FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults.\n  * In October 2024, clinical data was presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral Doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In July 2024, Journey Medical appointed Michael C. Pearce to its Board of Directors. Mr. Pearce is an accomplished executive, with substantial strategic, business and financial experience across many industries, including healthcare. \n\n\n\n**About Journey Medical Corporation** Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (“Journey Medical”) is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that primarily focuses on the selling and marketing of FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions through its efficient sales and marketing model.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, less certain other non-cash and infrequent items not considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses, including, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets, severance, short-term research and development expense and foreign exchange transaction losses. In particular, we exclude the following matters for the reasons more fully described below:\n\n  * _Share-Based Compensation Expense_ : We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued.\n  * _Non-core and Short-term Research and Development Expense_ : We exclude research and development costs incurred in connection with Emrosi, formerly referred to as DFD-29, including the filing fee payment made to the FDA and contractual milestone payments, which was the only product in our portfolio not approved for marketing and sale during the reporting period, because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses that are core to our long-term strategy. Instead, our long-term strategy is focused on the marketing and sale of our core FDA-approved dermatological products and out licensing our intellectual property and related technologies.\n  * _Amortization and impairments of Acquired Intangible Assets_ : We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with the acquisitions of intangible assets that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization impairments of acquired intangible assets. \n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are determined by dividing the resulting Adjusted EBITDA by the number of shares outstanding on an actual and fully diluted basis.\n\nManagement believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company’s core operating performance and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic, Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company’s competitors.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures:\n\n**JOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA**  \n($ in thousands except for share and per share amounts)  \n**Three-Month Periods Ended** | **Nine-Month Periods Ended**  \n**September 30** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Net Loss** | **$** | **(2,390** | **)** | **$** | **16,789** | **$** | **(16,193** | **)** | **$** | **(1,710** | **)**  \n**EBITDA:**  \nInterest | 570 | 260 | 1,303 | 1,465  \nTaxes | - | 95 | - | 95  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets | 814 | 814 | 2,443 | 2,952  \n**EBITDA** | **(1,006** | **)** | **17,958** | **(12,447** | **)** | **2,802**  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:**  \n**Non-Cash Components:**  \nShare-based compensation | 1,640 | 558 | 4,720 | 2,077  \nGain on extinguishment of debt | (1,125 | ) | - | (1,125 | ) | -  \nLoss on impairment of intangible assets | - | - | - | 3,143  \n**Non-core & Infrequent Components:**  \nShort-term R&D (includes one-time DFD-29 license and milestone payments) | 692 | 2,206 | 9,173 | 5,949  \nForeign exchange transaction losses | 51 | 100 | 104 | 181  \nSeverance | - | - | 147 | 711  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **252** | **$** | **20,822** | **$** | **572** | **$** | **14,863**  \n**Net income (loss) & Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA per common share:**  \n**Basic**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.91 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 1.13 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.82  \n**Diluted**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.80 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 0.99 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.72  \n**Weighted average number of common shares:**  \nGAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nGAAP - Diluted | 20,537,794 | 21,034,758 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Diluted | 24,762,014 | 21,034,758 | 24,263,348 | 20,588,661  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d/small/journeylogo-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d)\n\nSource: Journey Medical Corporation \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n"

(Nasdaq: FBIO) (“Fortress”), an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holdings and dividend and royalty revenue, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nLindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are thrilled to have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for Emrosi™, a potential best-in-class treatment for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, which is a tremendous milestone for Fortress and our partner company, Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey Medical”). This marks the first FDA approval across the Fortress portfolio, and demonstrates our ability to successfully in-license a clinical stage program and develop it through commercialization. We could achieve up to two more U.S. FDA approvals in the next nine months, and our next anticipated PDUFA goal date is December 28, 2024, for cosibelimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”). We have an exciting late-stage pipeline with many upcoming value creation opportunities, and we are focused on attaining our long-term strategy of building shareholder value, while bringing innovative treatment options to patients with unmet medical needs.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights****1****:**\n\n_Regulatory Updates_\n\n  * In November 2024, the FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29. Emrosi has the potential to be the new treatment paradigm for the millions of patients suffering from inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is expected to launch late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2025 by our partner company, Journey Medical (Nasdaq: DERM).\n  * In July 2024, the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024. Cosibelimab is currently in development at our partner company, Checkpoint Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CKPT) (“Checkpoint”).\n  * In December 2023, we completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl Therapeutics (“Sentynl”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl completed the rolling submission of the New Drug Application for CUTX-101 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cyprium Therapeutics (“Cyprium”), our subsidiary company that developed CUTX-101, will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101. \n\n\n\n_Clinical Updates_\n\n  * In October 2024, clinical data were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In September 2024, we presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. The longer-term results for cosibelimab demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.\n\n\n\n_Other Updates_\n\n  * In July 2024, we announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, our majority owned and controlled subsidiary company, Urica Therapeutics (“Urica”), entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement and related agreements with Crystalys Therapeutics (“Crystalys”). Urica transferred rights to dotinurad, its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity and granted Urica a securitized 3% royalty on future net sales of dotinurad.\n\n\n\n_Commercial Product Updates_\n\n  * Journey Medical’s net product revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $14.6 million, compared to net product revenues of $14.9 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**General Corporate:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint raised $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules.\n  * In July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue in accordance with their terms; the pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month.

The risks described below are a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, the risk factors described in Item 1A, and the other reports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As used below and throughout this filing (including in the risk factors described in Item 1A), the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress Biotech, Inc. individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context.\n\n​\n\n**Risks Inherent in Drug Development**\n\n​\n\n●| Many of our product candidates are in early development stages and are subject to time and cost intensive regulation and clinical testing, which may result in the identification of safety or efficacy concerns. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully developed or commercialized.   \n---|---  \n●| Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our product candidates’ commercial opportunity and profitability.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities**\n\n​\n\n●| We have a history of operating losses and expect such losses to continue in the future.   \n---|---  \n●| We have funded our operations in part through the assumption of debt, and the applicable lending agreements may restrict our operations. Further, the occurrence of any default event under an applicable loan document could adversely affect our business.  \n---|---  \n●| Our research and development (“R&D”) programs will require additional capital, which we may be unable to raise as needed and which may impede our R&D programs, commercialization efforts, or planned acquisitions.   \n---|---  \n●| Our board of directors has paused payments of dividends on our preferred stock, and there can be no assurance that monthly dividend payments will be resumed in a timely manner, or at all.  \n---|---  \n●| If we raise additional capital by issuing equity, equity-linked securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities, our existing stockholders will be diluted.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey”)**\n\n​\n\n●| Our operating income derives primarily from the sale of our partner company Journey’s dermatology products, particularly Qbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq and Zilxi. Any issues relating to the manufacture, sale, utilization, or reimbursement of Journey’s products (including products liability claims) could significantly impact our operating results.   \n---|---  \n●| A significant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. Three of Journey’s marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, as well as Emrosi, a modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea licensed from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, for which we recently obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval, currently have patent protection. Four of Journey’s marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, Luxamend and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. With respect to Journey products that are covered by valid claims of issued patents, such patents may be subject to invalidation, which would harm our operating income.  \n---|---  \n●| Continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our products for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of current and newly approved therapeutics.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization**\n\n​\n\n●| We have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business’ size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| We and our subsidiaries and partner companies have also entered into, and intend in the future to enter into, arrangements under which we and/or they have agreed to contingent dispositions of such companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. The consummation of any such arrangements with respect to certain product candidates may also result in our eligibility to receive a lower portion of sales (if any) of resulting approved products than if we had developed and commercialized such products ourselves.  \n---|---  \n●| Our growth and success depend on our acquiring or in-licensing products or product candidates and integrating such products into our businesses.  \n---|---  \n●| We act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of certain obligations of our subsidiaries, partner companies and partners, which could require us to pay substantial amounts based on the actions or omissions of said entities.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties**\n\n​\n\n●| We rely heavily on third parties for several aspects of our operations, including manufacturing and developing product candidates, conducting clinical trials, and producing commercial product supply. Such reliance on third parties reduces our ability to control every aspect of the drug development process and may hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof**\n\n​\n\n●| If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technologies and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technologies and products may be impaired.  \n---|---  \n●| We or our licensors may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or to enforce our or our licensors’ patents.   \n---|---  \n●| Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Generic Competition and Paragraph IV Litigation**\n\n​\n\n●| Generic drug companies may submit applications seeking approval to market generic versions of our products.  \n---|---  \n●| In connection with these applications, generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation and/or with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). Such challenges may subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and/or PTO proceedings.  \n---|---  \n●| As a result of the loss of any patent protection from such litigation or PTO proceedings, or the “at-risk” launch by a generic competitor of our products, our products could be sold at significantly lower prices, and we could lose a significant portion of product sales in a short period of time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates**\n\n​\n\n●| If our product candidates, if approved, are not broadly accepted by the healthcare community, the revenues from any such products are likely to be limited.   \n---|---  \n●| We may not obtain the desired product labels or intended uses for product promotion, or favorable scheduling classifications desirable to successfully promote our products.  \n---|---  \n●| Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be subject to various post-marketing requirements, including studies or clinical trials, the results of which could cause such products to later be withdrawn from the market.  \n---|---  \n●| Any successful products liability claim related to any of our current or future product candidates may cause us to incur substantial liability and limit the commercialization of such products.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Risks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries**\n\n​\n\n●| We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or executive action may have on our operations.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**General and Other Risks**\n\n​\n\n●| We have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), and if we again are unable to meet the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART I.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n1. Organization and Description of Business\n\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holding and dividend and royalty revenue streams. Fortress works in concert with its extensive network of key opinion leaders to identify and evaluate promising products and product candidates for potential acquisition. The Company has executed such arrangements in partnership with some of the world’s foremost universities, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, AstraZeneca plc and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.\n\nFollowing the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress leverages its business, scientific, regulatory, legal and finance expertise to help the partners achieve their goals. Partner and subsidiary companies then assess a broad range of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and development, including joint ventures, partnerships, out-licensings, sales transactions, and public and private financings. To date, four partner companies are publicly-traded, and three subsidiaries have consummated strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including AstraZeneca plc as successor-in-interest to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“AstraZeneca”) and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”). \n\nOur subsidiaries and partner companies that are pursuing development and/or commercialization of biopharmaceutical products and product candidates are: Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI, “Avenue”), Baergic Bio, Inc. (“Baergic”, a subsidiary of Avenue), Cellvation, Inc. (“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT, “Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), Helocyte, Inc. (“Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM, “Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO, “Mustang”) and Oncogenuity, Inc. (“Oncogenuity”). \n\nAs used throughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context. Generally, “subsidiary” refers to a private Fortress subsidiary, “partner company” refers to a public Fortress subsidiary, and “partner” refers to an entity with whom one of the foregoing parties has a significant business relationship, such as an exclusive license or an ongoing product-related payment obligation. The context in which any such term is used throughout this document, however, may dictate a different construal from the foregoing.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSince inception, the Company’s operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sale of subsidiaries/partner companies, and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants. The Company has incurred losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the next several years as it continues to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for its existing and new product candidates. Current cash and cash equivalents of $25.6 million for Fortress and private subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress (“Parent Entity”) are considered sufficient to fund the Parent Entity’s operations for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company will need to raise additional funding through strategic relationships, public or private equity or debt financings, sale of partner companies, grants or other arrangements to develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for the existing and new product candidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for the potential products, sales and marketing capabilities. If such funding is not available or not available on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company’s current development plans and plans for expansion of its general and administrative infrastructure may be curtailed. Fortress also has the ability, subject to limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 and other applicable laws and regulations, to raise money from the sale of common stock of the public companies in which it has ownership positions. \n\n​\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and results for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statement results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future period.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year for each of Avenue, Checkpoint, Mustang and Journey. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 28, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), from which the Company derived the balance sheet data at December 31, 2023, as well as Checkpoint’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024, Mustang’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, Avenue’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024, and Journey’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control but does not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but retains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense items are eliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based on ownership interests as calculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s significant estimates include, but are not limited to provisions for coupons, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, specialty pharmacy discounts, managed care rebates, product returns, inventory realization, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets, fair value of stock options and warrants, stock-based compensation, common stock issued to acquire licenses, accrued expenses and contingencies. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n**Restricted Cash**\n\nThe Company records cash held in trust or pledged to secure certain debt obligations as restricted cash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of restricted cash representing pledges to secure debt obligations and letters of credit in connection with certain office leases, and an undertaking posted by Cyprium to secure potential damages in an injunctive proceeding. \n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as of the dates presented:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $|  58,853| $|  72,307  \nRestricted cash| ​|  2,063| ​|  2,438  \nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  60,916| ​| $|  74,745  \n  \n​\n\n**Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K other than the following:\n\nAssets Held for Sale\n\nAssets held for sale represent assets that have met the criteria of “held for sale” accounting, as specified by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Long-lived Assets.” As of September 30, 2024, there are $2.2 million of lab and cell processing equipment, furniture and fixtures and computer equipment that are recorded as assets held for sale. The effect of suspending depreciation on the assets held for sale is immaterial to the results of operations. The assets held for sale are part of Mustang’s repurchase of assets from uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences, Inc. (“uBriGene”) (see Note 3). \n\n​\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n _Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ , which requires that an entity report segment information in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendment in the ASU is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ , which expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, _Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses_ , which requires new financial statement disclosures in tabular format, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments in this update do not change or remove current expense disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statement disclosures.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

Asset Purchase Agreements\n\nMustang\n\nAgreements with uBriGene \n\nOn May 18, 2023, Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Original Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to which Mustang agreed to sell its leasehold interest in its cell processing facility located in Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Facility”), and associated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility to uBriGene (the “Transaction”). Mustang and uBriGene subsequently entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2023 (“Amendment No. 1”), and Amendment No. 2 to the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 28, 2023 (“Amendment No. 2,” and together with the Original Asset Purchase Agreement and Amendment No. 1, the “Prior Asset Purchase Agreement”).\n\nOn July 28, 2023, pursuant to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang completed the sale of all of its assets that primarily relate to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (such operations, the “Transferred Operations” and such assets, the “Transferred Assets”) to uBriGene for upfront consideration of $6 million cash (the “Base Amount”). The Transferred Assets included all of Mustang’s assets, except for Mustang’s lease and related leasehold improvements of the Facility and contracts that are primarily used in the Transferred Operations. Mustang recorded a gain of $1.4 million in connection with the sale of the Transferred Assets and recorded approximately $0.3 million of the base consideration as deferred income, that was to be recognized upon the transfer of the lease.\n\nIn connection with the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene submitted a voluntary joint notice to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). Following CFIUS’s review and subsequent investigation of the transactions related to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, on May 13, 2024, Mustang, together with uBriGene and CFIUS, executed a National Security Agreement (the “NSA”), pursuant to which Mustang and uBriGene agreed to abandon the transactions related to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection therewith. The NSA obligated uBriGene and Mustang to terminate agreements between the two parties, including the Manufacturing Services Agreement, Quality Services Agreement, and Subcontracting CDMO Agreement. In addition, uBriGene must sell, or otherwise dispose of, the equipment assets purchased within 180 days after the execution of the NSA.\n\nJune 2024 Repurchase of Assets\n\nOn June 27, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to which Mustang agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to repurchase the Transferred Assets, primarily lab equipment and supplies (collectively, the “Repurchased Assets”). Pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene also terminated existing manufacturing and services agreements.\n\nAs consideration for the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang has agreed to pay to uBriGene a total purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1.4 million, consisting of (i) an upfront payment of $0.1 million due within five (5) business days of the Effective Date and a (ii) subsequent amount of $1.3 million due on the date that is twelve (12) months after the closing date (the “Deferred Amount”). In the event that as of the original (or any extended) date on which the Deferred Amount is payable, Mustang has, as of the date of the public reporting of its then-most recent quarterly audited or unaudited financial statements, net assets below $20 million, then Mustang may, upon written notice to uBriGene, elect to delay its payment obligation of the Deferred Amount by an additional six (6) months, with no limit on the number of such extensions available to Mustang. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mustang has not paid the Deferred Amount in full as of the date that is twelve (12) months after closing of the Repurchase Agreement, any amounts that remain outstanding will accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum beginning on the date that is twelve (12) months after closing and until the Deferred Amount is paid in full. Additionally, in connection with the termination of the agreements described above under the Repurchase Agreement, Mustang agreed to forgive a net receivable from uBriGene of approximately $3.3 million, comprised of outstanding receivables of $6.9 million and payables of $3.6 million, resulting in total purchase consideration in the Repurchase Transactions of approximately $4.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, the $1.3 million Purchase Price was recorded in Accrued Expenses - Other (see Note 10). As of September 30, 2024, the disposal group continues to be held for sale.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nMustang allocated the total purchase consideration of $4.7 million to the Repurchased Assets on a relative fair value basis. Mustang used a third-party to perform a valuation of the repurchased equipment, which resulted in a fair value less costs to sell of approximately $2.2 million. The remaining purchase consideration of $2.5 million was allocated to the supplies repurchased. The supplies repurchased with no alternative future use were recognized as research and development expense in an amount of $2.2 million. Repurchased supplies with an alternative future use of $0.3 million were also recognized in research and development expense, as Mustang does not have plans to resume operations in the facility, and it intends to dispose of the supplies in a single transaction with the equipment. Mustang concluded that the disposal group, which includes the repurchased equipment assets and associated supplies with an aggregate value of approximately $2.2 million, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the date of acquisition.\n\n​\n\nUrica\n\n​\n\nOn July 15, 2024, Urica entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”), royalty agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”), and related agreements (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) with Crystalys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Crystalys”). Crystalys is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2022 and seeded by life sciences institutional investors. Under the Transaction Documents, Urica sold the rights to its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, dotinurad, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity. Urica’s equity position cannot be reduced below 15% of Crystalys’ fully-diluted equity capitalization until it raises $150 million in equity securities. \n\n​\n\nThe Transaction Documents also grant Urica a securitized three percent (3%) royalty on future net sales of dotinurad to be paid by Crystalys, as well as the right to receive $0.6 million cash reimbursement for certain clinical and development costs incurred by Urica related to dotinurad. Urica has the right to appoint one director to the board of directors of Crystalys, as well as an additional board observer. Crystalys is obliged to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize dotinurad. \n\n​\n\nThe APA also gives Urica the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the sold assets for a repurchase price not to exceed $6.4 million plus accrued interest; the repurchase option expires upon the consummation by Crystalys of a qualified financing of at least $120 million occurring within the earlier to occur of (i) twelve months after receipt by Crystalys of minutes from an anticipated FDA meeting; or (ii) July 15, 2026. Urica recorded a liability for the $0.6 million received, which will be accreted up to the repurchase price over the term of the repurchase option, and will not recognize an asset for its ownership interest received in Crystalys until the expiration of the repurchase option. Accordingly, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Urica recorded accretion of $0.3 million of the repurchase option price, booked to interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\n​\n\nAvenue \n\n​\n\nInvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“InvaGen”) Share Repurchase\n\nUnder the Share Repurchase Agreement between Avenue and InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“InvaGen”) under which Avenue repurchased all of InvaGen’s shares in Avenue, Avenue agreed to pay InvaGen an additional amount as a contingent fee, payable in the form of seven and a half percent (7.5%) of the net proceeds of future financings, until $4.0 million in the aggregate is paid to InvaGen. In connection with equity financings in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Avenue made payments totaling $0.7 million to InvaGen.\n\n**4.

Fortress’ depreciation expense is recorded in both research and development expense and general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\n​\n\n _Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_\n\n​\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mustang concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain leasehold improvements and the related right of use asset. Mustang assessed the carrying value of the asset group consisting of the leasehold improvements and right-of-use asset in accordance with ASC 360, given the significant changes to Mustang’s operations, operating cash and the repurchase of equipment. The assessment of the recoverability of the asset group concluded that there was impairment on the carrying value of the asset group of approximately $2.6 million, which was allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of the assets. Approximately $2.2 million of the impairment loss was allocated to leasehold improvements, with the remaining $0.4 million allocated to the right-of-use asset. \n\n​\n\n6.

As such, the purchase price of any licenses acquired is classified as research and development-licenses acquired in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\nJourney\n\nIn June 2021, Journey entered a license, collaboration, and assignment agreement (the “DFD-29 Agreement”) to obtain global rights for the development and commercialization of EmrosiTM (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29, for the treatment of rosacea with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd (“DRL”); provided, that DRL retained certain rights to the program in select markets including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the DFD-29 Agreement, Journey paid $10.0 million. Based on the development and commercialization of Emrosi, additional contingent regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $140.0 million, which excludes a $15.0 million milestone payment triggered by FDA approval on November 4, 2024, may also become payable by Journey (see Note 19).

The Company borrowed $35.0 million under the New Oaktree Agreement on the Closing Date (the “2024 Oaktree Note”) and is eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million at the lenders’ discretion to support future business development activities. The 2024 Oaktree Note replaces the 2020 Oaktree Note (as defined below) in which the remaining $50.0 million balance was repaid in full.\n\nUnder the terms of the New Oaktree Agreement, the loans have a 30-month interest-only period with a maturity date of July 25, 2027, and bear interest at an annual rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 7.625% (subject to a 2.50% SOFR floor and a 5.75% SOFR cap). For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the interest rate applicable to the 2024 Oaktree Note was 12.91%. The Company is required to make quarterly interest-only payments until the maturity date, except fifty percent of the then-outstanding principal balance of the loans is due on March 31, 2027, with the remaining principal amount due on the maturity date.\n\nThe Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part, the amounts due under the New Oaktree Agreement at any time subject to a prepayment fee. Subject to prior written notice by the Company, to repay any amounts due prior to the maturity date, the Company must pay the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans being prepaid, (B) any accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Loans being prepaid, (C) any applicable Yield Protection Premium (as defined in the New Oaktree Agreement) and (D) if applicable, other unpaid amounts then due and owing pursuant to the New Oaktree Agreement and the other loan documents (such aggregate amount, the “Prepayment Price”); provided that each partial prepayment of the principal amount of the Loans shall be in an aggregate amount of at least $5.0 million and integral multiples of $1.0 million in excess thereof. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of the Loans with net cash proceeds from (i) certain casualty events, (ii) certain monetization events, including, among other things, certain asset sales and the sale(s) of priority review vouchers by certain subsidiaries of the Company, and the receipt by the Company of any dividend or other distributions in cash from any of its subsidiaries in excess of $5.0 million other than in connection with certain monetization events, (iii) debt issuances that are not permitted, and (iv) failure to comply with certain covenants. The lenders may elect to receive warrants to purchase common stock of the Company as an alternative to cash prepayments in some situations where a mandatory prepayment would otherwise be required. No mandatory prepayments were required in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nThe New Oaktree Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the New Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, (i) a requirement that the Company maintain a minimum liquidity of $7.0 million, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (“the “Liquidity Requirement”), and (ii) that product net sales of Journey meet a consolidated minimum net sales amount of $50.0 million on a trailing 12-month basis, tested quarterly, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (the “Minimum Net Sales Test”), subject to certain exclusions. Due to the approval of Emrosi, the minimum net sales amount will increase by $7.5 million each quarter, beginning in the third quarter of 2025, provided that the minimum net sales amount will in no event exceed $80.0 million. Both the Minimum Net Sales Test and the Liquidity Requirement will be reduced to $0 while the outstanding principal balance is less than or equal to $10.0 million. The Liquidity Requirement decreases to $5.0 million while the outstanding principal balance is between $10.0 million and $25.0 million. Failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company with respect to the Minimum Net Sales Test. \n\n​\n\nThe New Oaktree Agreement contains events of default that are customary for financings of this type, in certain circumstances subject to customary cure periods. In addition, the Company is also required to (i) raise common equity, or receive in monetizations or distributions, by the end of each calendar year prior to the maturity date, in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $20 million or 50% of an amount set forth in an annual budget delivered to the lenders and (ii) maintain a specified minimum equity stake in Journey. The capital raise and minimum stake covenants and financial covenants will not apply if the outstanding principal balance of the loan is less than or equal to $10 million. Following an event of default and any cure period, if applicable, the Agent will have the right upon notice to accelerate all amounts outstanding under the New Oaktree Agreement, in addition to other remedies available to the lenders as secured creditors of the Company.\n\nIn connection with the New Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted a security interest in favor of the Agent, for the benefit of the lenders, in substantially all of the Company’s assets, subject to customary exceptions, as collateral securing the Company’s obligations under the New Oaktree Agreement.\n\nAlso in connection with the New Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted warrants to the lenders to purchase up to 506,390 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $2.0735 per share (the “Warrants”). The Warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including for share splits, share dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The exercise price of the Warrants will also be adjusted if, while the Warrants are outstanding, the Company engages in any transaction involving the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock or equivalent securities at an effective price per share less than the exercise price of the Warrant then in effect (such lower price, the “Base Share Price”). In such case, the exercise price of the Warrants will be reduced to equal the Base Share Price. The Warrants are exercisable from July 25, 2024 and will expire on July 25, 2031 and may be net exercised for no cash payment at the holder’s election. The Company filed a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of Company common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (see Note 13).\n\n​\n\nThe Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the New Oaktree Agreement as of September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n _2020 Oaktree Note_\n\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company’s $50.0 million outstanding balance of the senior secured credit agreement with Oaktree (the “Prior Oaktree Agreement” and the debt thereunder, the “2020 Oaktree Note”) was terminated upon receipt by Oaktree of a payoff amount of $51.4 million from the Company comprised of principal, interest and the applicable final payment amount. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.6 million, representing unamortized debt issuance costs and inclusive of a $1.0 million prepayment fee. The payoff of the 2020 Oaktree Note was treated as a debt extinguishment, as the 2024 Oaktree Note originated from a fund group different from the Prior Oaktree Agreement.\n\n​\n\nThe Company had entered the Prior Oaktree Agreement in August 2020. The Prior Oaktree Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as certain financial covenants, including, among other things, (i) maintenance of minimum liquidity and (ii) a minimum revenue test that required Journey’s annual revenue to be equal to or to exceed annual revenue projections set forth in the Prior Oaktree Agreement. Failure by the Company or Journey, as applicable, to comply with the Prior Oaktree Agreement covenants would result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company.\n\n​\n\nThe Company was required to make quarterly interest-only payments until the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2020 Oaktree Note, August 27, 2025, at which point the outstanding principal amount would have been due. The Company could have voluntarily prepaid the 2020 Oaktree Note at any time subject to a prepayment fee. The Company was required to make mandatory prepayments of the 2020 Oaktree Note under various circumstances as defined in the Prior Oaktree Agreement. \n\n​\n\n _SWK Term Loan_\n\n​\n\nOn December 27, 2023 (the “SWK Closing Date”), Journey entered into a Credit Agreement with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility (the “Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount of up to $20.0 million. On the SWK Closing Date, Journey drew $15 million. On June 26, 2024, Journey drew the remaining $5.0 million under the Credit Facility. Loans under the Credit Facility (the “Term Loans”) mature on December 27, 2027. The Term Loans accrue interest which is payable quarterly in arrears. The Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month term SOFR (subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The interest rate resets quarterly. Interest payments began in February 2024 and are paid quarterly. \n\nOn July 9, 2024, Journey entered into an amendment (the “SWK Amendment”) to the Credit Facility. The SWK Amendment increased the total amount available under the Credit Facility from $20.0 million to $25.0 million. The $5.0 million available under the SWK Amendment is contractually required to be drawn upon FDA approval of Journey’s DFD-29 product candidate, Emrosi,subject to Journey receiving such approval on or before June 30, 2025. The FDA approved Emrosi on November 4, 2024 (see Note 19).\n\nBeginning in February 2026, Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 7.5% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date. If the total revenue of Journey, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, is greater than $70.0 million as of December 31, 2025, the principal repayment start date is extended from February 2026 to February 2027, at which point Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 15% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date.\n\nJourney may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in whole or in part. Prepayment of the Term Loans is subject to payment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 2% of the Term Loans prepaid plus the amount of interest that would have been due through the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date if the Term Loans are prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, (ii) 1% of the Term Loans prepaid if the Term Loans are prepaid on or after the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date but prior to the second anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, or (iii) 0% if prepaid thereafter. \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nUpon repayment in full of the Term Loans, Journey will pay an exit fee equal to 5% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans. Additionally, Journey paid an origination fee of $0.2 million on the SWK Closing Date and incurred issuance costs of $0.2 million, both of which have been recorded as a debt discount. Journey is accreting the carrying value of the SWK Term Loan to the original principal balance plus the exit fee over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. The amortization of the discount is accounted for as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The effective interest rate on the SWK Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 was 14.9%. \n\nThe SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by substantially all assets of Journey. As of September 30, 2024, Journey was in compliance with the financial covenants under the SWK Credit Facility.\n\n_Urica_ _8 %__Cumulative Convertible Class B Preferred Offering_\n\nIn December 2022 and February 2023, Urica closed private offerings of its 8% Cumulative Convertible Class B Preferred Stock (the “Urica Preferred Stock”), at a price of $25.00 per share (“Subscription Price”) pursuant to which it sold a total of 135,494 shares of Urica Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $3.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million (the “Urica Offering”). A non-cash contingent warrant value of $0.1 million was also recorded in debt discount (see Note 6).\n\nDividends on the Urica Preferred Stock were payable monthly by Fortress in shares of Fortress common stock based upon a 7.5% discount to the average closing price over the 10-day period preceding the dividend payment date. Dividends were recorded as interest expense. For the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of nil and $0.1 million associated with the Urica dividends and for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, associated with the Urica dividends.\n\nThe shares mandatorily converted into Urica common stock upon either: (i) a qualified financing pursuant to which Urica raises at least $20 million in aggregate gross proceeds; or (ii) a sale of Urica. Additionally, in the event that neither such a qualified financing nor a sale of Urica had occurred prior to June 27, 2024, then each holder of Urica Preferred Stock was eligible to receive, at Fortress’ election, one of: (x) a cash payment equal to the product of the Subscription Price and the number of shares of Urica Preferred Stock held by such holder; (y) a number of shares of Fortress common stock equal to the Fortress Share Exchange Amount (as defined in the applicable instrument); or (z) a combination of the foregoing. On June 27, 2024, as neither a qualified financing nor a sale of Urica occurred, Fortress elected to exchange the outstanding shares of Urica Preferred Stock, which was recorded as a liability, into 2,028,345 shares of Fortress common stock. \n\n​\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nInterest expense includes contractual interest, and fees include amortization of the debt discount and amortization of fees associated with loan transaction costs, amortized over the life of the loan.

(“Sun”) pursuant to the Ximino asset purchase agreement. Journey owed $3.0 million of license installment payments to Sun associated with the license of Ximino. Pursuant to the Ximino Settlement Agreement, Journey agreed to settle the total outstanding obligation owed to Sun for a total of $1.9 million, payable in three installments: (1) $0.6 million upon execution of the Ximino Settlement Agreement, (2) $0.6 million on December 1, 2024, and (3) $0.6 million on January 15, 2025. Journey accounted for the settlement of the license installment payment as a gain of $1.1 million for the difference between the carrying value of the license installment payments of $3.0 million and the settlement amount of $1.9 million. The Company recorded the difference of $1.1 million as a gain on extinguishment of debt, which is included in Other income on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n11. Non-Controlling Interests \n\nThe Company’s ownership interests in its consolidated subsidiaries at September 30, 2024 was similar to December 31, 2023, except for Mustang which decreased from 19.0% to 7.4%.\n\n​\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n12. Net Loss per Common Share \n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributed to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributed to Fortress, less the Series A Preferred dividends and adjusted for subsidiary deemed dividends, by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period, not including unvested restricted stock, and without consideration for Common Stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share due to net losses in all periods. \n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect on the net loss per share calculation from Series A Preferred dividends was $2.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, and partner company deemed dividends were $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect on the net loss per share calculation from Series A Preferred dividends was $2.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, and partner company deemed dividends were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. \n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted and basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the Company were identical since potential common shares were excluded from the calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive. nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of net loss per common share:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**  \nWarrants to purchase Common Stock|  14,499,535|  127,296  \nOptions to purchase Common Stock|  558,896|  160,233  \nUnvested Restricted Stock|  1,628,082|  1,338,750  \nUnvested Restricted Stock Units|  166,160|  106,708  \nTotal|  16,852,673|  1,732,987  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n13. Stockholders’ Equity\n\n _9.375 %__Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock Dividends_\n\n​\n\nOn July 5, 2024, Fortress announced that the Company’s Board of Directors had decided to pause the monthly dividend of $0.1953125 per share of the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). In accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue to accrue and cumulate until such dividends are authorized or declared. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the pause should be lifted.\n\n​\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no dividends were declared by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total undeclared dividends of approximately $2.0 million, which represents the cumulated (but undeclared) dividends due to Series A Preferred shareholders on September 30, 2024. Dividends in arrears that have not been declared by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets but are reflected in the net loss attributable to common shareholders (see Note 12).\n\n​\n\nStock-based Compensation \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had the following equity compensation plans: the Fortress Biotech, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2013 Plan”), the Fortress Biotech, Inc. 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) and the Fortress Biotech, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). In May 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors and stockholders approved an amendment to the 2013 Plan to increase the number of authorized shares issuable by 10.0 million shares, and approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of shares issuable by 1.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 10.0 million shares are available for issuance under the 2013 Plan, and approximately 1.0 million shares are available for issuance under the ESPP. \n\n​\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

Oaktree is entitled to a reduction in exercise price if, at any time prior to the expiration of the 2024 Oaktree Warrants, the Company issues equity, warrants or convertible notes (collectively known as “Security Instruments”) at a price that is less than 95% of the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the trading day prior to the issuance of the Security Instruments. As a result of the September 2024 registered direct offering (see Note 13), the exercise price on the 2024 Oaktree warrants was lowered to $1.65 per share, and recorded approximately $20,000 expense to interest expense.\n\n​\n\nThe Company evaluated the accounting treatment of the 2024 Oaktree Warrants and determined that the 2024 Oaktree warrants met the scope exception of _ASC 815-10-15-74(a) Derivatives and Hedging_ and therefore the warrants should be classified in stockholders’ equity. As such, the Company used a Black-Scholes model to value the Oaktree Warrants. Utilizing the following inputs: term of 7 years, volatility of 90.52%, risk-free rate of return of 4.18% yielding a value of $1.3 million. _ASC 470-20-25-2 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options_ dictates that debt or stock issued with detachable warrants requires the proceeds to be allocated to the two instruments based on their relative fair values. The relative fair value of the warrants was determined to be $1.3 million and was recorded as a component of Stockholders’ Equity in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. \n\n​\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nIn connection with the 2020 Oaktree Note (see Note 9), in August 2020 the Company had issued warrants to Oaktree and certain of its affiliates to purchase up to approximately 0.1 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.14 per share (the “Oaktree Warrants”). The Oaktree Warrants expire on August 27, 2030 and may be net exercised at the holder’s election. Oaktree is entitled to additional warrants if at any time prior to the expiration of the Oaktree Warrants the Company issues equity, warrants or convertible notes (collectively known as “Security Instruments”) at a price that is less than 95% of the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the trading day prior to the issuance of the Security Instruments. As a result of the September 2024 registered direct offering (see Note 13), the Company issued an additional 14,450 warrants to Oaktree and adjusted the exercise price of the Oaktree Warrants to $7.2392, and recorded the resulting expense of $27,000 to interest expense. \n\n​\n\nThe Company filed registration statement No. 333-282384 on Form S-1 to register the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the 2024 Oaktree Warrants and the additional Oaktree Warrants, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 7, 2024. \n\n​\n\n _Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”)_\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved the LTIP for the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Rosenwald, and Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, Mr. Weiss (amended and restated with stockholder approval on June 7, 2017 and May 23, 2024). The LTIP consists of a program to grant equity interests in the Company and in the Company’s subsidiaries, and a performance-based bonus program that is designed to result in performance-based compensation that is deductible without limit under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n\nOn January 1, 2024 and 2023, the Compensation Committee granted 216,465 shares and 81,286 shares each to Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss, respectively. These equity grants were made in accordance with the LTIP, and each award represents 1% of total outstanding shares of the Company as of the dates of such grants. The shares’ original vesting terms includes vesting in full if the employee was either in the service of the Company as an employee, Board member or consultant (or any combination of the foregoing) on the tenth anniversary of the LTIP, or the eligible employee has an involuntary Separation from Service (as defined in the LTIP). The only other vesting condition – one based on the achievement of an increase in the Company’s market capitalization – has already been achieved, with respect to each annual award under the LTIP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\n _University of Tennessee Research Foundation v. Caelum Biosciences, Inc._\n\nCaelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), a former subsidiary of Fortress that was sold to AstraZeneca’s Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. subsidiary (“Alexion”) in October 2021, was the defendant in a lawsuit brought by The University of Tennessee Research Foundation (“UTRF”) captioned as _University of Tennessee Research Foundation v. Caelum Biosciences, Inc._ , No. 19-cv-00508, which was formerly pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the “UTRF Litigation”). UTRF brought claims against Caelum, for, _inter alia_ , trade secret misappropriation. UTRF primarily alleged that Caelum unauthorizedly used non-patent trade secrets owned by UTRF in the development of Caelum’s 11-1F4 monoclonal antibody, known as CAEL-101. Under the agreement pursuant to which Alexion acquired Caelum (as amended, the “DOSPA”), Fortress had certain indemnification obligations of Caelum pertaining to the UTRF litigation and maintained a consent right over any potential settlements of the UTRF litigation by Caelum.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Caelum and UTRF entered into a stipulation with the court pursuant to which UTRF’s claims were dismissed without prejudice; on October 16, 2024, Caelum and UTRF entered into a definitive settlement agreement (the “UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which UTRF’s claims were dismissed with prejudice and Caelum agreed to make an upfront payment and additional potential milestone-based payments to UTRF. Fortress and the other sellers under the DOSPA are explicit releasees and third party beneficiaries under the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement. In connection with the execution of the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement, Caelum, Alexion and Fortress entered into an amendment to the DOSPA (the “DOSPA Amendment”), which, _inter alia_ : (1) terminated any continuing indemnification by Fortress and the other sellers under the DOSPA in respect of the UTRF Litigation; (2) reduced the amounts of the potential future earn-out payments potentially owing to the sellers under the DOSPA (including Fortress) from an aggregate amount up to $350 million to an aggregate amount up to $295 million; (3) released to Caelum all amounts remaining in an escrow fund that had been established at the time of the Alexion acquisition to backstop potential indemnifiable damages, including those incurring under the UTRF Litigation (with 100% of such released amount constituting reimbursement for legal fees and other expenses incurred by Caelum in defending the UTRF Litigation); and (4) memorialized Fortress’ consent for Caelum to settle the UTRF Litigation. Neither the UTRF-Caelum Settlement Agreement nor the DOSPA Amendment implicates any out-of-pocket payment by Fortress or any other seller under the DOSPA.

At December 31, 2023, one of the Company’s dermatology products customers accounted for more than 10% of its total accounts receivable balance at 13%.\n\n​\n\n18. Income taxes\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to US federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return with subsidiaries for which the Company has an 80% or greater ownership interest. Subsidiaries for which the Company does not have an 80% or more ownership are not included in the Company’s consolidated income tax group and file their own separate income tax return. As a result, certain corporate entities included in these financial statements are not able to combine or offset their taxable income or losses with other entities’ tax attributes.\n\nIncome tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate, and includes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company expects a net deferred tax asset with a full valuation allowance and 0% estimated annual effective tax rate for 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense recognized was $0.1 million and a refund of approximately $24,000, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense recognized was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n**19. Subsequent Events**\n\n _Journey_\n\n​\n\nOn November 4, 2024, Journey announced that the FDA approved Emrosi™ (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Journey is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates initial supply will be available in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025. \n\n​\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n**Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n​\n\nThe approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi demonstrated statistically significant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40mg capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.\n\n​\n\nThe approval of Emrosi by the FDA triggered Journey’s requirement to draw on the remaining $5.0 million under the Credit Facility with SWK. The FDA approval also triggered a $15.0 million milestone payment obligation to DRL that is due 30 days after the FDA approval.\n\n_Checkpoint_\n\nOn November 12, 2024, Checkpoint received approximately $9.2 million from the exercise of existing Series B warrants for the issuance of 3,256,269 shares of common stock from a May 2023 registered direct offering with an exercise price of $2.821 per share. \n\n​\n\n _Mustang Warrant Inducement and Private Placement_\n\nIn October 2024, Mustang entered into a definitive agreement for the exercise of certain existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 16,877,638 shares of its common stock having an exercise price of $0.237 per share, originally issued in May 2024. The issuance or resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the existing warrants are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by Mustang on Form S-1 (File No. 333-278006). The gross proceeds to Mustang from the exercise of the existing warrants are expected to be approximately $4 million, prior to deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by Mustang.\n\nIn consideration for the immediate exercise of the existing warrants for cash, Mustang issued two new series of unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 33,755,276 shares of common stock. The new warrants will have an exercise price of $0.27 per share and will be exercisable commencing on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the new warrants (the “Stockholder Approval”). One of the new warrants to purchase 16,877,638 shares of common stock will have a term of five years from the Stockholder Approval, and the other new series of warrants to purchase 16,877,638 shares of common stock will have a term of twelve months from the Stockholder Approval.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Item 2.** **Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n _You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, total net revenue includes a one-time $19.0 million payment from Maruho for a license to additional territories in Asia. Journey, our partner company, primarily focuses on selling and marketing of prescription dermatology products.   \n---|---  \n●| For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $14.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively, of net revenue is related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $42.5 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of net revenue is related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nLate Stage Product Candidates\n\nCosibelimab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) \n\n●| Cosibelimab’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of December 28, 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| In September 2024, our partner company, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab, its investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”) who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC, during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses.  \n---|---  \n●| In July 2024, Checkpoint, announced the FDA had accepted for review its resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab,. The resubmission has been accepted as a complete response to the complete response letter received in December 2023, and the FDA has set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (“CIK”) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.  \n---|---  \n●| Cosibelimab was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Checkpoint.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nEmrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg, also known as DFD-29, for the treatment of rosacea) \n\n●| In November 2024, Journey announced that the FDA approved Emrosi™ (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Journey is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates initial supply will be available in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.  \n---|---  \n●| The approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi demonstrated statistically significant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40mg capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.  \n---|---  \n●| In October 2024, data assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics “(PK”) of oral DFD-29 (versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference. DFD-29 40mg showed higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, which may translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea.  \n---|---  \n●| In March 2024, the FDA accepted the NDA for DFD-29 and set a PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024.   \n---|---  \n●| Emrosi (DFD-29) was developed for the treatment of rosacea at our partner company, Journey, in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  \n---|---  \n  \n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\nTriplex (cytomegalovirus vaccine)\n\n●| Triplex, a vaccine for control of cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial for adults co-infected with HIV and CMV that is now fully enrolled with topline data anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The study aims to show that vaccination with Triplex can safely elicit a CMV-specific immune response and reduce asymptomatic CMV replication in a population of people with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy. The study will also evaluate whether this intervention might reduce chronic inflammation and immune activation, as compared to placebo, and thus, potentially reduce related mortality and morbidity.   \n---|---  \n●| In May 2024, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of Triplex in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The trial is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIH/NIAID”) that could provide over $20 million in non-dilutive funding and will be conducted in up to 20 nationally recognized transplant centers in the United States.  \n---|---  \n●| Triplex is currently the subject of multiple ongoing clinical trials, including: a Phase 2 evaluation for CMV control in recipients of liver transplant (NCT06075745); a Phase 1/2 trial for CMV control in pediatric recipients of HCT (NCT03354728); a Phase 2 trial for safety and immunogenicity in adults living with HIV and CMV (NCT05099965); a Phase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of stem cell transplant in which the stem cell donor is vaccinated with Triplex (NCT06059391) and a Phase 1 trial of Triplex in combination with a bi-specific CMV/CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT05432635).  \n---|---  \n●| In 2023, Helocyte additionally entered into an option agreement with City of Hope for exclusive worldwide rights to a novel bispecific CMV/HIV CAR T cell therapy (optionally for use in combination with Triplex), which is currently the subject of a Phase 1 trial in adults living with HIV-1 (see NCT06252402).  \n---|---  \n●| Triplex was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our subsidiary, Helocyte.  \n---|---  \n  \nCAEL-101 (Light chain fibril-reactive monoclonal antibody for AL Amyloidosis) \n\n●| On October 5, 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Caelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), a former subsidiary of Fortress for an upfront payment of approximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of which approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress. The agreement also provides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders totaling up to $295 million, payable upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. Fortress is eligible to receive 42.4% of all potential milestone payments, which together with the upfront payment, would total up to approximately $182 million.   \n---|---  \n●| There are two ongoing global Phase 3 studies of CAEL-101 for Mayo Stage IIIa and May Stage IIIb AL amyloidosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04512235 and NCT04504825).  \n---|---  \n●| CAEL-101 (anselamimab) was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Caelum (founded by Fortress) until its acquisition by AstraZeneca in October 2021.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nCUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) \n\n●| In December 2023, our subsidiary, Cyprium, completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl is obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CUTX-101, including the funding of the same. Additionally, Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales milestones under the Agreement and royalties on net sales of CUTX-101 ranging from 3% to 12.5% on tiered annual net sales. Cyprium will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at the New Drug Application (“NDA”) approval for CUTX-101.  \n---|---  \n●| The rolling NDA for CUTX-101 was completed by Sentynl in the fourth quarter of 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| CUTX-101 was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Cyprium until the asset transfer in December 2023.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nEarly Stage Product Candidates\n\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T-cell therapy)\n\n●| In March 2024, we announced our expansion into autoimmune diseases with MB-106, a personalized CD20-targeted, 3rd-generation autologous CAR T-cell therapy. Planning for a proof-of concept Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial evaluating MB-106 in autoimmune diseases is underway.   \n---|---  \n●| In June 2024, we announced updated data for MB-106 showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (“WM”), a rare form of blood cancer. There was an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 90% in the cohort with durable responses observed, including three complete responses (“CR”), two very good partial responses (“VGPR”), and four partial responses, and one patient remains in complete remission at 31 months.  \n---|---  \n●| MB-106 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nDotinurad (urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout) \n\n●| In July 2024, Urica entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement, and related agreements (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) with Crystalys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Crystalys”). Crystalys is a Delaware corporation founded in 2023 and seeded by leading life sciences institutional investors. Urica transferred rights to its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, dotinurad, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys’ outstanding equity including certain anti-dilution provisions through the raise of $150 million in equity securities. The Transaction Documents also granted Urica a securitized three percent (3%) royalty on future net sales of dotinurad to be paid by Crystalys, and receive nominal cash reimbursement payments for certain clinical and development costs incurred by Urica related to dotinurad.  \n---|---  \n●| Dotinurad was approved in Japan in 2020 as a once-daily oral therapy for gout and hyperuricemia. Dotinurad was efficacious and well-tolerated in more than 500 Japanese patients treated for up to 58 weeks in Phase 3 clinical trials.   \n---|---  \n●| Dotinurad was sourced by Fortress and was in development at Urica until dotinurad was acquired by Crystalys in July 2024.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nMB-109 (IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T Cells (MB-101) + HSV-1 oncolytic virus (MB-108)) \n\n●| In November 2024, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for Mustang for MB-108, a herpes simplex virus type 1 (“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus, for the treatment of malignant glioma.  \n---|---  \n●| In March 2024, data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating MB-101 IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T-cells in high-grade glioma were published in _Nature Medicine._ MB-101 was well tolerated and 50% of patients achieved stable disease or better, with two partial responses and two complete responses in high grade glioma patients. The two patients who achieved complete response both had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T-cells pre-therapy (i.e., “hot” tumors), and their responses lasted 7.5 and 66+ months, respectively. In the cohort with dual intratumoral (ICT) / intraventricular (ICV) delivery and an optimized manufacturing process there was a ~70% improvement in median overall survival (10.2 months) compared to the expected survival rate of six months in this patient population.   \n---|---  \n●| MB-101, MB-108, and MB-109 are currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nAJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer)\n\n●| In May 2024, we announced that last patient completed dosing in a Phase 1b/2a study, which is evaluating AJ201 in the U.S. for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedy’s Disease. Kennedy’s Disease is a debilitating rare genetic neuromuscular disease primarily affecting men. Topline data for the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 in SBMA are expected around year-end 2024.  \n---|---  \n●| AJ201 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Avenue.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nGeneral Corporate\n\n●| In July 2024, Checkpoint raised gross proceeds of $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at the-the-market under Nasdaq rules.   \n---|---  \n●| In July 2024, Fortress’ Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company’s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the suspension should be lifted.  \n---|---  \n●| Also in July 2024, Journey Medical entered into an amendment of its existing credit facility with SWK, increasing the amount of the facility from $20 million to $25 million.  \n---|---  \n●| Additionally in July 2024, Fortress announced the reduction of total debt outstanding and the entry into a new $50 million term loan with Oaktree Capital Management with a maturity in 2027. The Company borrowed $35.0 million under the agreement on the closing date and is eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million at the lenders’ discretion to support future business development activities. In connection with the new term loan, Fortress repaid the prior $50 million term loan with Oaktree.   \n---|---  \n●| In September 2024, Fortress raised gross proceeds of $8 million in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements.   \n---|---  \n●| In October 2024, Mustang raised $4 million in a warrant exercise and concurrent private placement.  \n---|---  \n●| In November 2024, Checkpoint raised $9.2 million in a warrant exercise.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 28, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”). There were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies from December 31, 2023.\n\n**Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\n​\n\n**Smaller Reporting Company Status**\n\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we chose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K, have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and certain other matters.\n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control but does not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but retains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense items are eliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based on ownership interests as calculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s ownership of the issued and outstanding common and preferred shares in certain consolidated Fortress subsidiaries as of the period presented: \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30,**  \n**Partner Company/Subsidiary**|  ​| **2024**  \nAvenue1| ​|  4.2| %  \nCellvation| ​|  79.2| %  \nCheckpoint1| ​|  9.7| %  \nCyprium| ​|  75.0| %  \nHelocyte| ​|  83.0| %  \nJourney1| ​|  47.6| %  \nMustang1| ​|  7.4| %  \nOncogenuity| ​|  73.5| %  \nUrica| ​|  68.4| %  \n  \n​\n\n​  \n---  \n  \nNote 1: Denotes entities that are publicly-traded.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \n**Revenue**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nProduct revenue, net| ​| $|  14,629| ​| $|  15,279| ​| $|  (650)| (4)| %  \nCollaboration revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  182| ​| ​|  (182)| (100)| %  \nRevenue – related party| ​|  —| ​|  31| ​|  (31)| (100)| %  \nOther revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  19,260| ​| ​|  (19,260)| (100)| %  \nNet revenue| ​|  14,629| ​|  34,752| ​|  (20,123)| (58)| %  \n​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \n**Operating expenses**|  ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​|  ​| ​  \nCost of goods sold – product revenue| ​|  5,285| ​|  6,429| ​|  (1,144)| (18)| %  \nResearch and development| ​|  9,446| ​|  20,288| ​|  (10,842)| (53)| %  \nResearch and development – licenses acquired| ​|  —| ​|  60| ​|  (60)| (100)| %  \nSelling, general and administrative| ​|  21,993| ​|  21,733| ​|  260| 1| %  \nTotal operating expenses| ​|  36,724| ​|  48,510| ​|  (11,786)| (24)| %  \nLoss from operations| ​|  (22,095)| ​|  (13,758)| ​|  (8,337)| 61| %  \n​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nOther income (expense)| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​|  ​| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  589| ​|  547| ​|  42| 8| %  \nInterest expense and financing fee| ​|  (6,209)| ​|  (2,534)| ​|  (3,675)| 145| %  \nGain on common stock warrant liabilities| ​|  19| ​|  4,542| ​|  (4,523)| (100)| %  \nOther income | ​| ​|  1,071| ​|  620| ​|  451| 73| %  \nTotal other income (expense)| ​|  (4,530)| ​|  3,175| ​|  (7,705)| (243)| %  \nLoss before income tax expense| ​| ​|  (26,625)| ​|  (10,583)| ​|  (16,042)| 152| %  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nIncome tax expense | ​|  69| ​|  141| ​|  (72)| (51)| %  \n**Net Loss**|  ​| **(26,694)**|  ​| **(10,724)**|  ​| **(15,970)**| **149**| **%**  \n​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nLess: net loss attributable to non-controlling interest| ​|  13,827| ​|  5,679| ​|  8,148| 143| %  \n**Net loss attributable to Fortress**|  ​| **$**| **(12,867)**|  ​| **$**| **(5,045)**|  ​| **$**| **(7,822)**| **155**| **%**  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n49\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRevenue\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \n**Revenue**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nProduct revenue, net| ​| $|  14,629| ​| $|  15,279| ​| $|  (650)| ​| (4)| %  \nCollaboration revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  182| ​| ​|  (182)| (100)| %  \nRevenue – related party| ​|  —| ​|  31| ​|  (31)| ​| (100)| %  \nOther revenue| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  19,260| ​| ​|  (19,260)| ​| (100)| %  \n**Net revenue**|  ​| **$**| **14,629**|  ​| **$**| **34,752**|  ​| **$**| **(20,123)**|  ​| **(58)**| **%**  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 we generated $14.6 million of net revenue related to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $34.8 million of net revenue, of which $15.3 million relates to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products, $0.2 million relates to Cyprium’s collaboration revenue with Sentynl, and other revenue of approximately $19.3 million, which includes Journey’s receipt of royalties from its exclusive out-licensing partner for Qbrexza in Japan, Maruho, as well as a $19 million non-refundable upfront payment from Maruho related to a license granted by Journey to Maruho for the development and commercialization of Qbrexza in additional territories in Asia. Since October 2023, Journey has no longer been eligible to receive royalties from Maruho. \n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the net decrease in revenue of $20.1 million, or 58%, is mainly due to Journey’s one-time $19 million up-front payment received in the third quarter of 2023 related to Qbrexza territory licensing. Journey’s $0.7 million, or 4%, decrease in product revenue is due primarily to a $0.6 million decrease in net product revenue from legacy products. Qbrexza net product revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, to $7.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $5.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, with the increase primarily driven by additional volume, due to Journey’s continued marketing efforts and the recent expansion of access and coverage platforms related to Qbrexza. This revenue increase was offset by a decrease in Accutane revenue of $0.9 million, or 18%, and a combined decrease in Amzeeq and Zilxi of $0.9 million, or 30%. Accutane’s decrease is attributed to recent market competition, and Amzeeq and Zilxi revenue is down due to a slight decrease in unit sales volume and an increase in coupon rebates as a result of the expansion of Journey’s patient coverage options under its overall market access program driving average selling prices lower as compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nCollaboration revenue related to Cyprium’s agreement with Sentynl was fully recognized as of December 31, 2023 due to Sentynl’s assumption of control of the CUTX-101 development program in December 2023.\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nCost of goods sold – product revenue| ​| $|  5,285| ​| $|  6,429| ​| $|  (1,144)| ​| (18)| %  \n  \n​\n\nWe incurred $5.3 million and $6.4 million of costs of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The decrease in Other of $2.3 million is due to a decrease in clinical costs at Urica of $1.8 million related to the Phase 1b trial and the sale of the asset to Crystalys, and a decrease in research and development costs of $1.0 million at Cyprium due to the asset transfer of CUTX-101 to Sentynl in 2023, offset by an increase of $0.4 million in license costs at both Helocyte and Cellvation. Journey’s decrease of $1.4 million is primarily driven by lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. Avenue’s increase in research and development expense of $1.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in clinical development costs related to AJ201. Checkpoint’s increased research and development expense of $0.9 million is due to increased commercial manufacturing costs for cosibelimab of $1.1 million due to manufacturing costs incurred to build inventory to support a potential product launch, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in clinical costs for product candidates. \n\n​\n\nThe table below provides a summary by entity of noncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development expense for the periods presented:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nStock-based compensation - research & development| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFortress| ​| $|  444| ​| $|  401| ​| $|  43| ​| 11| %  \nSubsidiaries/Partner Companies:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAvenue| ​|  89| ​|  144| ​|  (55)| ​| (38)| %  \nCheckpoint| ​|  543| ​|  303| ​|  240| ​| 79| %  \nJMC| ​| ​|  150| ​| ​|  24| ​| ​|  126| ​| 525| %  \nMustang| ​|  (10)| ​|  (18)| ​|  8| ​| (44)| %  \nOther1| ​|  —| ​|  1| ​|  (1)| ​| (100)| %  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development| ​|  1,216| ​|  855| ​|  361| ​| 42| %  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n\n​\n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $64.6 million of net revenue, of which $44.4 million relates to the sale of Journey’s branded and generic products, and $0.5 million relates to Cyprium’s collaboration revenue with Sentynl, $0.5 relates to Journey’s royalties from Maruho and $19 million is the non-refundable upfront payment from Maruho related to a license granted by Journey to Maruho for the development and commercialization of Qbrexza in additional territories in Asia. Since October 2023, Journey has no longer been eligible to receive royalties from Maruho. \n\nThe net decrease in revenue of $22.0 million or 34% is mainly due to Journey’s one-time $19 million payment received from Maruho related to territory licensing for Qbrexza in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenue from Journey’s legacy products decreased by $1.9 million, or 41%, to $2.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $4.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to the continued price erosion of Targadox from generic competition.\n\n​\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nCost of goods sold – product revenue| ​| $|  18,642| ​| $|  20,645| ​| $|  (2,003)| ​| (10)| %  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nCosts of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $18.6 million and $20.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold of $2.0 million, or 10%, is mainly due to product royalties that were lower by $1.0 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to the contractual expiration of Journey’s Exelderm product royalty in November 2023, the contractual decrease in the Qbrexza royalty in the second quarter of 2023, and the discontinuation of Ximino in September of 2023. In addition, the discontinuation of Ximino has resulted in lower PDUFA fees of $0.8 million and lower non-cash license amortization of $0.5 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in product costs of $0.5 million, as a result of product mix, mainly driven by the higher Accutane net product revenue.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n​\n\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and patents, laboratory costs and other supplies.\n\n​\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were approximately $47.1 million and $87.7 million, respectively.

Checkpoint’s reduced research and development expense of $15.9 million is due to reduced commercial manufacturing costs for cosibelimab of $9.5 million related to manufacturing costs incurred in the prior period to build inventory to support a potential product launch of cosibelimab, reduced regulatory expenses of $3.5 million as prior period costs included $3.2 million for the PDUFA fee for the BLA filing of cosibelimab in the first quarter of 2023, and a $2.1 million decrease in clinical costs for product candidates. Journey’s increased research and development costs of $3.6 million are due to the $4.1 million filing fee payment made to the FDA in January 2024 for the DFD-29 NDA submission in addition to the $3.0 million contractual milestone payment made to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. triggered by the FDA’s acceptance of the DFD-29 NDA in March 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses incurred by Journey as the clinical program was concluded. \n\n​\n\nNoncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nStock-based compensation - research & development| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFortress| ​| $|  1,319| ​| $|  1,200| ​| $|  119| 10| %  \nPartner Companies:| ​| ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​  \nAvenue| ​|  179| ​|  150| ​|  29| 19| %  \nCheckpoint| ​|  1,629| ​|  880| ​|  748| 85| %  \nJMC| ​| ​|  466| ​| ​|  88| ​| ​|  377| ​| 426| %  \nMustang| ​|  (650)| ​|  —| ​|  (650)| 100| %  \nOther1| ​|  —| ​|  1| ​|  (1)| (100)| %  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development| ​| $|  2,943| ​|  2,319| ​| $|  624| 27| %  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n\n​\n\nWe expect research and development costs to remain lower in 2024 due to portfolio optimization and assets completing pivotal trials in 2023 and entering registration and approval stages.\n\n​\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n​\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses were $60.9 million and $71.5 million, respectively.

The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs at Mustang is attributable to continued cost reduction efforts and optimization relating to personnel, consulting, and infrastructure. The decrease in Other is led by reduced professional fees and legal spending at Urica and Cyprium. The increase of $1.3 million at Checkpoint is attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of $0.6 million due to new employee grants, and an increase in professional fees of $0.8 million.\n\n​\n\nThe table below provides a summary by entity of noncash, stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense for the periods presented.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nStock-based compensation - Selling, general and administrative | ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFortress| ​| $|  6,280| ​| $|  6,787| ​| $|  (507)| ​| (7)| %  \nPartner Companies:| ​| ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nAvenue| ​|  535| ​|  449| ​|  86| ​| 19| %  \nCheckpoint| ​|  1,862| ​|  1,345| ​|  517| ​| 38| %  \nJMC| ​| ​|  4,254| ​| ​|  1,989| ​| ​|  2,265| ​| 114| %  \nMustang| ​|  150| ​|  380| ​|  (230)| ​| (61)| %  \nOther1| ​|  407| ​|  56| ​|  350| ​| 621| %  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense - selling, general and administrative| ​| $|  13,488| ​|  11,006| ​| $|  2,482| ​| 23| %  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte, Oncogenuity and Urica.\n\n​\n\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expenses to remain flat or slightly lower for 2024.\n\n​\n\nAsset Impairment\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred impairment charges of $2.6 million attributable to Mustang’s assessment of the recoverability of the asset group consisting of its leasehold improvements and the associated right-of-use asset. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Journey recorded a loss on the impairment of intangible assets of $3.1 million related to the impairment of the Ximino intangible asset, due to lower net product revenue and gross profit levels for the Ximino products.\n\nOther Expense\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **Change**|  ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**|  $| %  \nOther expense| ​|  ​| ​|  ​| ​| ​|  ​| ​  \nInterest income| ​| $|  2,157| ​| $|  2,296| ​| $|  (139)| ​| (6)| %  \nInterest expense and financing fee| ​|  (10,933)| ​|  (13,255)| ​|  2,322| ​| (18)| %  \nGain (loss) on common stock warrant liabilities| ​|  (578)| ​|  10,708| ​|  (11,286)| ​| (105)| %  \nOther income (expense)| ​| ​|  1,334| ​|  (2,049)| ​|  3,383| ​| (165)| %  \nTotal other expense| ​| $|  (8,020)| ​|  (2,300)| ​| $|  (5,720)| ​| 249| %  \n  \n​\n\nTotal other expense increased $5.7 million, or 249%, from expense of $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to expense of $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of $11.3 million in the gain on common stock warrant liabilities, offset by the $2.3 million decrease in interest expense and financing fees due to debt paid off by JMC and Mustang in 2023, as well as the $3.4 million increase in other income due in part to Journey’s $1.1 million gain on the extinguishment of short-term debt related to installment payments for the license of Ximino. Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of a $4.1 million loss on the deconsolidation of Aevitas, offset by Mustang’s gain on the sale of assets to uBriGene of $1.4 million, and grant income of $0.7 million.\n\n56\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe will require additional financing to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for our existing and new product candidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for our potential products, and sales and marketing capabilities. We have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.9 million, of which $25.6 million relates to Fortress and private subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress, $4.7 million relates to Checkpoint, $3.5 million relates to Mustang, $22.5 million relates to Journey, and $2.6 million relates to Avenue. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. We may seek funds through equity or debt financings, joint venture or similar development collaborations, the sales of subsidiaries/partner companies, royalty financings, or through other sources of financing; the rising interest rate environment may cause the Company to pay more interest on its various debt instruments, which could lead to higher operating expenses. \n\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\n​\n\nComponents of cash flows from publicly-traded partner companies comprise:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n($ in thousands)| **Fortress** 1| **Avenue**| **Checkpoint**| **JMC**| **Mustang**| **Total**  \nStatement of cash flows data:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  (14,333)| ​| $|  (8,262)| ​| $|  (23,924)| ​| $|  (11,352)| ​| $|  (9,413)| ​| $|  (67,284)  \nInvesting activities| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nFinancing activities| ​|  (643)| ​|  9,076| ​|  23,699| ​|  6,374| ​|  6,329| ​|  44,835  \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  (14,976)| ​| $|  814| ​| $|  (225)| ​| $|  (4,978)| ​| $|  (3,084)| ​| $|  (22,449)  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n($ in thousands)| **Fortress** 1| **Avenue**| **Checkpoint**| **JMC**| **Mustang**| **Total**  \nStatement of cash flows data:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  (24,943)| ​| $|  (7,127)| ​| $|  (40,757)| ​| $|  21,760| ​| $|  (42,223)| ​| $|  (93,290)  \nInvesting activities| ​|  44| ​|  (3,000)| ​|  —| ​|  (5,000)| ​|  5,916| ​|  (2,040)  \nFinancing activities| ​|  9,131| ​|  3,580| ​|  30,461| ​|  (24,014)| ​|  (30,037)| ​|  (10,879)  \nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  (15,768)| ​| $|  (6,547)| ​| $|  (10,296)| ​| $|  (7,254)| ​| $|  (66,344)| ​| $|  (106,209)  \n  \n​\n\nNote 1:| Includes Fortress, non-public subsidiaries and elimination entries.  \n---|---  \n  \nCash flows on a consolidated basis are as follows:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​  \n($ in thousands)| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating activities| ​| $|  (67,284)| ​| $|  (93,290)| ​| $|  26,006  \nInvesting activities| ​|  —| ​|  (2,040)| ​|  2,040  \nFinancing activities| ​|  44,835| ​|  (10,879)| ​|  55,714  \nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| ​| $|  (22,449)| ​| $|  (106,209)| ​| $|  83,760  \n  \n​\n\n57\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $26.0 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to the decrease of $30.6 million in net loss, the $11.1 million decrease in the expense associated with subsidiaries/partner companies’ warrant liabilities, and the $8.0 million decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by the $3.1 million change in the expense for research and development – licenses acquired, $4.1 million change in the expense for loss from deconsolidation and dissolution of subsidiaries, and $3.1 million for Journey’s asset impairment loss in the prior period.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is a decrease of $2.0 million, due to JMC’s $5.0 million used in investing activities for the deferred cash payment made to VYNE related to the acquisition of Amzeeq and Zilxi and Avenue’s $3.0 million cash payment towards the purchase of the AnnJi license, each in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, offset by Mustang’s $6.0 million proceeds from the sale of assets to uBriGene in July 2023, and no comparable activities in the period ended September 30, 2024.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $44.8 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $55.7 million. The increase is attributable to the funds used in the prior period to pay off partner companies’ long-term debt of $50.4 million and JMC’s line of credit of $30.9 million, offset by loan proceeds of $38.7 million, proceeds from partner companies’ sale of stock, options and warrants of $37.1 million in the current period.\n\nWe fund our operations through cash on hand, the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sales of subsidiaries/partner companies, and from the proceeds resulting from the exercise of warrants and stock options. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.9 million, of which $25.6 million relates to Fortress and private subsidiaries primarily funded by Fortress, $4.7 million relates to Checkpoint, $3.5 million relates to Mustang, $22.5 million relates to Journey, and $2.6 million relates to Avenue. Restricted cash at September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, of which $1.2 million relates to Fortress, $0.4 million relates to Mustang, and $0.5 million relates to Cyprium.\n\nSources of Liquidity \n\n_Stock Offerings and At-The-Market Share Issuances_\n\n _Fortress_\n\nOn May 17, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (File No. 333-279516) on Form S-3, which was declared effective on May 30, 2024 (the “2024 Shelf”).

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Avenue issued 245,617 shares through the Avenue ATM for net proceeds of $0.9 million.\n\n​\n\n _Mustang_\n\n​\n\nOn April 23, 2021, Mustang filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-255476) (the “Mustang 2021 S-3”), which was declared effective on May 24, 2021. Under the Mustang 2021 S-3, Mustang was able to sell up to a total of $200.0 million of its securities. In 2024, Mustang sold approximately $4.4 million of securities under the Mustang 2021 S-3 until Mustang’s ability to register new offers and sales of securities under such registration statement expired on May 24, 2024. \n\nOn May 31, 2024, Mustang filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279891) (the “Mustang 2024 S-3”), which was declared effective on June 12, 2024. Under the Mustang 2024 S-3, Mustang may sell up to a total of $40.0 million of its securities. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $36.3 million of the Mustang 2024 S-3 remains available for sales of securities, subject to the General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3. The ability of Mustang to register new offers and sales of securities under the Mustang 2024 S-3 expires on June 12, 2027. \n\n​\n\nOn May 31, 2024, Mustang entered into an At-the-Market Offering Agreement (the “Mustang ATM”) relating to the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Mustang 2024 S-3. Under the Mustang ATM, Mustang pays the sales agents for the program a commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mustang issued approximately 2.7 million shares through the Mustang ATM for net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.\n\n​\n\n60\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn May 2024, Mustang closed on an equity offering of 1,160,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 15,717,638 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof), and three series of 50,632,914 warrants with a combined equity offering price of $0.237 per share (or per share common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants with an exercise price of $0.237 per share. The Series A-1 warrants have a five-year term, the Series A-2 warrants have a twenty-four month term, and the Series A-3 warrants have a nine month term. The warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including share splits, share dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The net proceeds of the equity offering, after deducting the fees and expenses of the placement agent and other offering expenses payable by Mustang, but excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants, was approximately $3.2 million. All of the 15,717,638 pre-funded warrants have since been exercised.\n\n​\n\nIn June 2024, Mustang closed on a registered direct offering of 3,025,000 shares of common stock at $0.41 per share (or common stock equivalent) priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,105,000 shares of common stock, at a price per pre-funded warrant equal to $0.4099, the price per share of common stock, less $0.001. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, became exercisable upon issuance and remain exercisable until exercised in full. In a concurrent private placement, Mustang also agreed to issue and sell unregistered warrants to purchase up to 6,130,000 shares of its common stock, with an exercise price of $0.41 per share, exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants and will expire five years from the date of stockholder approval. Net proceeds were approximately $2.1 million, after placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million. All of the 3,105,000 pre-funded warrants have since been exercised.\n\n_Journey_\n\nOn December 30, 2022, Journey filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269079) (the “Journey 2022 S-3”), which was declared effective on January 26, 2023.

The development and regulatory approval processes can take many years, and it is unlikely that our product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA and/or foreign equivalent regulatory bodies, would be commercially available for several years. Only a small percentage of drugs under development successfully obtain regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund development programs, we cannot be sure that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment.\n\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. Before we may seek regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will be required to demonstrate, through well-controlled clinical trials, that our product candidates are effective and have a favorable benefit-risk profile for their target indications. Success in early clinical trials is not necessarily indicative of success in later stage clinical trials, during which product candidates may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy, despite having progressed through initial clinical testing, which may cause significant setbacks. Further, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. As a result, product candidates that we advance into clinical trials may never receive regulatory approval.\n\nEven if any of our product candidates are approved, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may place limitations on our ability to commercialize products at the intended price points, may grant approval contingent on the product’s performance in costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a label that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. The regulatory authority may also require the label to contain warnings, contraindications, or precautions that limit the commercialization of the product. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”), or foreign equivalent, may schedule one or more of our product candidates under the Controlled Substances Act, or its foreign equivalent, which could impede such product’s commercial viability. Any of these scenarios could impact the commercial prospects for one or more of our current or future product candidates.\n\nThe extensive regulation to which our product candidates are subject may be costly and time consuming, cause anticipated or unanticipated delays, and/or prevent the receipt of the required approvals for commercialization. \n\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market a product candidate until the FDA approves such product candidate’s BLA or NDA. The approval process is uncertain, expensive, often spans many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition to significant and expansive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates depends on the results of required non-clinical testing, including the characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. \n\nThe FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes, testing procedures or equipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Further, the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process and may change approval policies or interpretations of regulations at any time, which could delay, limit or preclude a product candidate’s approval. \n\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies may delay, limit or refuse approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\n●| disagreement with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials, including proper use of clinical trial methods and methods of data analysis;  \n---|---  \n●| an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and/or effective for an indication;  \n---|---  \n●| the FDA’s rejection of clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;  \n---|---  \n  \n63\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| the FDA’s determination that clinical trial results do not meet the statistical significance levels required for approval;   \n---|---  \n●| a disagreement by the applicable regulator regarding the interpretation of preclinical study or trial data;   \n---|---  \n●| determination by the FDA that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical supplies or plan to contract for commercial supplies, do not satisfactorily comply with cGMPs; or  \n---|---  \n●| a change to the FDA’s approval policies or interpretation of regulations rendering our clinical data, product characteristics, or benefit-risk profile insufficient or unfavorable for approval.  \n---|---  \n  \nForeign approval procedures vary by country and may, in addition to the aforementioned risks, involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological development during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals may prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\n\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials, or suspensions or terminations of such trials, could result in increased costs and/or delay our ability to pursue regulatory approvals.\n\nThe commencement or resumption of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays in:\n\n●| obtaining regulatory approval to commence or resume a clinical trial;  \n---|---  \n●| identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;  \n---|---  \n●| reaching and maintaining agreements on acceptable terms with CROs and trial sites, the terms of which may be subject to extensive negotiation and modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;  \n---|---  \n●| obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n●| obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;  \n---|---  \n●| developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;  \n---|---  \n●| adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;  \n---|---  \n●| the death, disability, departure or other change to the principal investigator or other staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given site;  \n---|---  \n●| identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or  \n---|---  \n●| retaining patients who participate in a clinical trial and replacing those who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.  \n---|---  \n  \nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the termination of a given development program or the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\n\nIf any of our product candidates causes unacceptable adverse safety events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product, preventing us from generating revenue from such products’ sale. Alternatively, even if a product candidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could lead to the withdrawal of such product from the market.\n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and/or delay or prevent our ability to complete development of that product candidate or generate product revenues.\n\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;  \n---|---  \n●| inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;  \n---|---  \n●| stopping rules contained in the protocol;  \n---|---  \n●| unforeseen safety or chemistry, manufacturing and control issues, or other determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and  \n---|---  \n●| lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.  \n---|---  \n  \nRegulatory requirements and guidance may change, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Any such change may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs, which may in turn impact a clinical trial’s cost, timing, and likelihood of success. If any clinical trial is delayed, suspended, or terminated, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed, and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer. In addition, many of these factors may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\n\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates’ target indications and those competitor products are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidates will be reduced or eliminated.\n\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. Any of these developments may render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\n\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial opportunity for one or more of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations outside the scope of our in-licensed patents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\n●| capital resources;  \n---|---  \n●| development resources, including personnel and technology;  \n---|---  \n●| clinical trial experience;  \n---|---  \n●| regulatory experience;  \n---|---  \n●| expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and  \n---|---  \n●| manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing capabilities.  \n---|---  \n  \n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we are able to, or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property or exclusivity rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, safe, useful and/or less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient registration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\n\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\n\nIf any of the technologies underpinning our product candidates, including gene therapy, is claimed to be unsafe, such product candidate may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The success of our gene therapy platforms in particular depends upon physicians who specialize in treating the diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments involving our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that do obtain approval and/or a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. Concern about environmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated, may also hinder the commercialization of our products.\n\nThe making, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances are subject to regulation by state, federal and foreign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies. \n\nControlled substances are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”) and regulations of the DEA. IV tramadol, under development by our partner company Avenue, will be subject to these regulations.\n\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse and no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. \n\nVarious states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\n\nFor any of our products classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. There is a risk that DEA regulations may limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials for our product candidates and the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to both meet commercial demand and build inventory to mitigate possible supply disruptions.\n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRegulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of any of our product candidates that are classified as controlled substances, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. \n\nThe FDA limits regulatory approval for our product candidates to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\n\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases set forth in the approval for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWhile physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s label or that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities (“off label uses”), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the practice of medicine or behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies regarding the promotion of off-label use. \n\nIf our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement actions, including Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall, institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\n\nIf the FDA does not conclude that a product candidate satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for the product candidate will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\n\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FDCA, would allow an NDA we submit to FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA’s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these product candidates, would likely substantially increase. We could need to obtain more additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would likely result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization in a timely manner, or at all.\n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval.\n\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products. \n\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\n\nWe have historically financed a significant portion of our growth and operations in part through the assumption of debt. Should an event of default occur under any applicable loan documents, our business would be materially adversely affected. Further, our current credit arrangement with Oaktree restricts our and certain of our subsidiaries’ and partner companies’ abilities to take certain actions.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the total amount of debt outstanding, net of the debt discount, was $52.5 million. If we default on our obligations, the holders of our debt may declare the outstanding amounts immediately payable together with accrued interest, and/or take possession of any pledged collateral. If an event of default occurs, we may be unable to cure it within the applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment and we may be unable to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, current or future debt obligations may limit our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs, or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. Such restrictions may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, we entered into a $60 million senior secured credit agreement (the “Prior Oaktree Agreement” and the debt thereunder, the “Oaktree Note”) with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, “Oaktree”). On July 25, 2024, we, as borrower, entered into a $50.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the “New Oaktree Agreement”) with Oaktree. We borrowed $35.0 million under the Agreement on the date of the agreement and are eligible to draw up to an additional $15.0 million with the lenders’ consent. The New Oaktree Agreement replaces the Prior Oaktree Agreement. The New Oaktree Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the New Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, (i) a requirement that we maintain a minimum liquidity of $7.0 million, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement, and (ii) that product net sales of Journey meet a consolidated minimum net sales amount of $50.0 million on a trailing 12-month basis, tested quarterly, which may be reduced or increased as described in the New Oaktree Agreement (the “Minimum Net Sales Test”), subject to certain exclusions. Failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights with respect to the Minimum Net Sales Test. The breach of any other such provisions (even, potentially, in an immaterial manner) could result in an event of default under the New Oaktree Agreement, the announcement and impact of which could have a negative impact on the trading prices of our securities. The restrictions imposed by such provisions may also inhibit our and certain of our subsidiaries and partner companies’ ability to enter into certain transactions or arrangements that management otherwise believes would be in our or such partner companies’ best interests, such as dispositions that would result in cash inflows to Fortress and/or our subsidiaries and partner companies, or acquisitions or financings that would promote future growth.\n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe have a history of operating losses that is expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will be able to sustain current revenues or whether we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\n\nWe continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $86.5 million and $122.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $142.3 million and $203.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $734.1 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future, and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product candidates and finance investments in certain of our existing and new subsidiaries in accordance with our growth strategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders’ equity.\n\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n\n●| one or more of our development-stage product candidates is approved for commercial sale and we decide to commercialize such product(s) ourselves, due to the need to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this product without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;  \n---|---  \n●| we are required by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;  \n---|---  \n●| there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;  \n---|---  \n●| we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, depending on the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;  \n---|---  \n●| there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;  \n---|---  \n●| we become involved in any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits; and  \n---|---  \n●| there are any regulatory developments affecting our competitors’ product candidates.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our development stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from such development-stage products. Our ability to generate revenue from such development-stage products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\n●| obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or acquire in the future;  \n---|---  \n●| manufacture commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, at acceptable cost levels; and  \n---|---  \n●| develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved.  \n---|---  \n  \nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n\n69\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nTo fund our operations and service our debt securities, which may be deemed to include our Series A Preferred Stock, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock to decline.\n\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, as we have done in the past, we may also elect to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by Journey and its ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Journey may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries and partner companies, including Journey, is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and partner companies.\n\nOur ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to access the capital markets to refinance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that could improve our competitive position and results of operations.\n\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs, commercialization efforts or planned acquisitions and potentially change our growth strategy.\n\n​\n\nOur R&D programs will require substantial additional capital for research, preclinical testing and clinical trials, establishing pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establishing and developing quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, and administrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past, ongoing, and future collaborations, and through additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress the trading prices of our Securities. If additional funds are required to support our operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\n\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $46.9 million and $92.0 million, respectively, and during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $101.7 million and $134.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on our growth strategy. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential cash needs. \n\nUnder current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our public float remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the “baby shelf rules.” SEC regulations permit us to use the highest closing sales price of our common stock (or the average of the last bid and last ask prices of our common stock) on any day within 60 days of sales under the registration statement to calculate our public float.\n\n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAs of the date of the 2023 Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, for sales following the date of the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K, and until we again have a public float with a value in exceeds of $75 million, if ever, we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of our public float under shelf registration statements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the amount of securities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statements will also decrease.\n\nOur ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures, acquisitions and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner or on different terms than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. The terms of our existing debt arrangements, including that with Oaktree, have and will continue to inhibit our and our subsidiaries’ abilities to raise capital.\n\nWe may be unable to generate returns for our investors if our partner companies and subsidiaries, several of which have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products or, if not yet profitable, cannot obtain additional third-party financing.\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial financial and operational commitments in our subsidiaries, which often have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional third-party financing to fund product and services development or acquisitions. Our business depends in large part on the ability of one or more of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies to innovate, in-license, develop or acquire successful biopharmaceutical products and/or acquire companies in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If certain of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies do not successfully obtain additional third-party financing to commercialize products or are not acquired in change-of-control transactions that result in cash distributions, as applicable, the value of our businesses and our ownership stakes in our partner companies may be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\n\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing Common Stock (or other Securities that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock), the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have also entered into financing arrangements to raise capital for our subsidiaries under which Common Stock is or may be issuable to investors in lieu of cash, upon certain conditions being met; in the event such issuances take place, they will also be dilutive of the stakes of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings may impose covenants that restrict our operations, including by limiting our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain financial commitments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing or sublicensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\n\n​\n\nWe have paused dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock and may not be able to resume payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the future if we have insufficient cash or available “surplus” as defined under Delaware law to make such dividend payments.\n\nOn July 5, 2024, our board of directors paused the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock until further notice. However, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock accrue daily, are payable monthly and will continue to accrue from the last date of payment. Our board of directors deemed the foregoing to be in the best interests of the Company and its common stockholders in light of the Company’s current and anticipated financial condition and outlook, and after considering its fiduciary duties to the Company’s common stockholders and other relevant factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the future requires us to have either net profits or positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital, and that we have sufficient working capital in order to be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business. Our ability to pay dividends may also be impaired if any of the risks described in this report were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash or “surplus” to resume payment of the cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in a timely manner, or at all. \n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe have never paid and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future, except for the dividend we previously paid on our Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our Common Stockholders.\n\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, or made stock dividends, except for the dividend we previously paid on shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses, and retain our stock positions. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash or stock dividends. Equally, each of our subsidiaries and partner companies is governed by its own board of directors with individual governance and decision-making regimes and mandates to oversee such entities in accordance with their respective fiduciary duties. As a result, we alone cannot determine the acts that could maximize value to you of such partner companies and subsidiaries in which we maintain ownership positions, such as declaring cash or stock dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for holders of our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe have historically relied in part on sales of our common stock and other securities to fund our operations, and our future ability to obtain additional capital through stock sales or other securities offerings may be more costly than in the past, or may not be available to us at all.\n\nWe have historically relied in part on sales of our common stock to fund our operations. For example, we raised an aggregate of approximately $30.2 million in gross proceeds in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and $6.5 million in gross proceeds in fiscal 2024 to date through the sale of shares of our common stock and other securities in offerings made under a Form S-3 “shelf” registration statement. Using a shelf registration statement to conduct an equity offering to raise capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. We are no longer eligible to file any new shelf registration statements due to non-payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock since July 5, 2024 and, if we do not resume payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, pay all accumulated dividends and otherwise remain compliant with the other conditions for use of a Form S-3 registration statement by the time we file our next Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will lose the ability to use our currently effective “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3. Accordingly, we may then only be able to conduct additional offerings of our securities under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1 registration statement. We would expect either of these alternatives to be a more expensive method of raising additional capital and more dilutive to our stockholders relative to using a shelf registration statement.\n\n​\n\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation \n\nFuture revenue based on sales of our dermatology products, Qbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq, Zilxi, Targadox, Exelderm and Luxamend, may be lower than expected or lower than in previous periods.\n\nThe vast majority of our operating income for the foreseeable future is expected to come from the sale of our dermatology products through our partner company Journey. Any setback that may occur with respect to such products could significantly impair our financial condition, cash flows and/or operating results and/or reduce the value of our Securities. Setbacks for such products could include, but are not limited to, issues related to: supply chain, shipping; distribution; demand; manufacturing; product safety; product quality; marketing; government regulation, including but not limited to pricing or reimbursement; licensing and approval; intellectual property rights; competition with existing or new products, including third-party generic competition; product acceptance by physicians, other licensed medical professionals, and patients; and higher than expected total rebates, returns or recalls. Also, a significant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic competition; the introduction of new competitor products, or increased market share of existing competitor products, could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. \n\n​\n\nWe face challenges as our products face generic competition and/or losses of exclusivity. \n\n​\n\nJourney’s products do and may compete with well-established products, both branded and generic, with similar or the same indications. We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result.\n\n​\n\n72\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nA significant portion of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating income. Three of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, Zilxi, and Emrosi, for which we recently received FDA approval, currently have patent protection. Four of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, Luxamend and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. \n\n​\n\nAccutane currently competes in the Isotretinoin market with five other therapeutically equivalent A/B rated products. Targadox currently competes with one therapeutically equivalent A/B rated generic product. Exelderm may face A/B rated generic competition in the future.\n\n​\n\nGeneric versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version by third-party payors, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Any reduction in sales of our products, or the prices we receive for our products as a result of generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\n​\n\nAny disruptions to the capabilities, composition, size or existence of Journey’s field sales force may have a significant adverse impact on our existing revenue stream. Further, our ability to effectively market and sell any future products that we may develop and for which we receive marketing authorization, will depend on our ability to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any such products. \n\n​\n\nJourney’s field sales force has been and is expected to continue to be an important contributor to our commercial success. Any disruptions to our relationship with such field sales force or the professional employer organization that employs our field sales force, could materially adversely affect our product sales. \n\n​\n\nThe establishment, development, and/or expansion of a field sales force, either by us or certain of our partners or vendors, or the establishment of a contract field sales force to market any products for which we may have or receive marketing approval is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any such product launch or compromise the successful commercialization of such products. If we are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish or maintain arrangements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\n​\n\nIf our products are not included in managed care organizations’ formularies or coverage by other organizations, our products’ utilization and market shares may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nIn the United States, continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our products for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment of our currently marketed products or those which we may acquire or develop in the future.\n\n​\n\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs. Managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies are based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical conditions. Failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our products. If our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\n73\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nReimbursement for our products and product candidates may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\n\nWe have obtained approval for some products, and intend to seek approval for other product candidates, to commercialize in both the United States and in countries and territories outside the United States. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign countries, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those countries relating to such products. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures.\n\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which pharmaceuticals they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination regarding whether a product is:\n\n●| a covered benefit under its health plan;  \n---|---  \n●| safe, effective and medically necessary;  \n---|---  \n●| appropriate for the specific patient;  \n---|---  \n●| cost-effective; and  \n---|---  \n●| experimental or investigational.  \n---|---  \n  \nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require that we provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Additionally, while we may seek approval of our product candidates in combination with each other, there can be no guarantee that we will obtain coverage and reimbursement for any of our products together, or that such reimbursement will incentivize the use of our products in combination with each other as opposed to in combination with other agents which may be priced more favorably to the medical community.\n\n​\n\nLegislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare systems of the United States and certain foreign countries could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Several federal agencies including FDA, CMS, DEA and HHS, in addition to state and local governments, regulate drug product development and marketing. In particular, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products by revising the payment methodology for many products reimbursed by Medicare, resulting in lower rates of reimbursement for many types of drugs, and added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program that involves commercial plans negotiating drug prices for their members. In addition, this law provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this law and future laws could decrease the coverage and price that we will receive for any approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Therefore, any limitations in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in reductions in payments from private payors.\n\nSince 2003, there have been several other legislative and regulatory changes to the coverage and reimbursement landscape for pharmaceuticals. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA,” was enacted and made significant changes to the United States’ healthcare system. The ACA and any revisions or replacements of that Act, any substitute legislation, and other changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n74\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn the United States there is significant interest in containing healthcare costs and increasing the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices. Congress has continually explored legislation intended to address the cost of prescription drugs. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.\n\nWhile we cannot predict what additional proposals may ultimately become law, the elements under consideration could significantly change the landscape in which the pharmaceutical market operates.\n\nState legislatures are similarly active in proposing and passing legislation and regulations aimed at controlling pharmaceutical and biological prices and drug cost transparency. \n\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and prescription drugs may adversely affect:\n\n●| the demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;  \n---|---  \n●| our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;  \n---|---  \n●| our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;  \n---|---  \n●| the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and  \n---|---  \n●| the availability of capital.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the payment that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\n\n​\n\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our product candidate, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\n\n​\n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\n\nWe have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business’ size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories. We have also entered into several arrangements under which we have agreed to contingent dispositions of subsidiaries, partner companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\n\n​\n\nWe have entered into and consummated several partnerships and/or contingent sales of our assets and subsidiaries, including an equity investment and contingent acquisition agreement between Caelum and AstraZeneca (the acquisition component of which has consummated) and a development funding and contingent asset purchase between Cyprium and Sentynl (the acquisition component of which has not yet consummated). Each of these arrangements has been time-consuming and has diverted management’s attention. As a result of these consummated/contingent sales, as with other similar transactions that we may complete, we may experience a reduction in the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets, our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories. \n\nIn addition, in connection with any transaction involving a (contingent or non-contingent) sale of one of our subsidiaries, partner companies or their assets, we may surrender our ability to realize long-term value from such asset or company, in the form of foregone product sales, royalties, milestone payments, sublicensing revenue or otherwise, in exchange for upfront and/or other payments. In the event, for instance, that a product candidate underpinning any such asset or company is granted FDA approval for commercialization following the execution of documentation governing the sale by us of such asset or company, the transferee of such asset or company may realize tremendous value from commercializing such product, which we would have realized for ourselves had we not executed such sale transaction and been able to achieve applicable approvals independently.\n\nShould we seek to enter into collaborations or divestitures with respect to other assets or companies, we may be unable to consummate such arrangements on satisfactory or commercially reasonable terms within our anticipated timelines. In addition, our ability to identify, enter into and/or consummate collaborations and/or divestitures may be limited by competition we face from other companies in pursuing similar transactions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. \n\n​\n\nAny collaboration or divestiture we pursue, whether we are able to complete it or not, may be complex, time consuming and expensive, may divert from management’s attention, may have a negative impact on our customer relationships, cause us to incur costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted collaboration or divestiture during the transaction process and also to incur costs of closing and disposing the affected business or transferring the operations of the business to other facilities. In addition, if such transactions are not completed for any reason, the market price of our Common Stock may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market of us generally and a decline in the market price of our Securities. \n\n​\n\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of the obligations, actions or inactions of certain of our subsidiaries and partner companies. We have also entered into, and may again enter into, certain arrangements with our subsidiaries, partner companies and/or third parties pursuant to which a substantial number of shares of our capital stock may be issued. Depending on the terms of such arrangements, we may be contractually obligated to pay substantial amounts to third parties, or issue a substantially dilutive number of shares of our capital stock, based on the actions or inactions of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies, regulatory agencies or other third parties.\n\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as indemnitor of potential losses or liabilities that may be experienced by one or more of our subsidiaries, partner companies and/or their partners or investors. If we become obligated to pay all or a portion of such indemnification amounts, our business and the market value of our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and/or debt securities may be materially adversely affected. \n\nAdditionally, we have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to act as guarantor in connection with equity or debt raises by our partner companies, pursuant to which we may become obligated either to pay what could be a significant amount of cash or issue what could be a significant number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock if certain events occur or do not occur, which could lead to a depletion of resources or dilution to our Common Stock, or both. \n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products and product candidates, and if we are unable to do so, or to integrate acquired products into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\n\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies. Future in-licenses or acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| exposure to unknown liabilities;  \n---|---  \n●| disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;  \n---|---  \n●| difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies in the current economic environment;  \n---|---  \n●| incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;  \n---|---  \n●| higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;  \n---|---  \n●| increased amortization expenses;  \n---|---  \n●| difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;  \n---|---  \n●| impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and  \n---|---  \n●| inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger biopharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors may have access to greater financial resources than us and/or may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\n\nCertain of our officers and directors serve in similar roles at our partner companies, subsidiaries, related parties and/or other entities with which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, which could result in conflicts of interests relating to ongoing and future relationships and transactions with these parties.\n\nWe share directors and/or officers with certain of our subsidiaries, partner companies, related parties and other entities with which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, and such arrangements could create conflicts of interest in the future, including with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities. While we believe that we have put in place policies and procedures to identify and mitigate such conflicts, and that any existing agreements that may give rise to such conflicts and any such policies or procedures were negotiated at arm’s length in conformity with fiduciary duties, such conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflict of interest, may nonetheless arise. The existence and consequences of such potential or perceived conflicts could expose us to lost profits, claims by our investors and creditors, and harm to our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\n\nCertain of our executives, directors and principal stockholders, whose interests may be adverse to those of our other stockholders, can control our direction and policies.\n\nCertain of our executive officers, directors and stockholders own nearly or more than 10% of our outstanding Common Stock and, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own a significant percentage of our capital stock. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any sale, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our \n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nassets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock by:\n\n●| delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;  \n---|---  \n●| impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or  \n---|---  \n●| discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we acquire, enter into joint ventures with or obtain a controlling interest in, companies in the future, our financial condition, operating results and the value of our Securities may be adversely affected, thereby diluting stockholder value, disrupting our business and/or diminishing the value of our holdings in our partner companies.\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain significant ownership stakes in other companies. Acquisitions of, joint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;  \n---|---  \n●| diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;  \n---|---  \n●| successfully negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us;  \n---|---  \n●| the impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;  \n---|---  \n●| the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed acquisitions or investment;  \n---|---  \n●| with respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; and  \n---|---  \n●| potential inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or invest in.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or other transaction opportunities, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, we might incur higher costs than anticipated, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\n\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our business activities.\n\nAny terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including military conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial markets and economy. This includes Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the conflict between Israel and the Hamas and Hezbollah extremist groups, recent attacks by armed groups on cargo ships in the Red Sea, and tensions across the Taiwan Strait. For instance, the United States or other countries may impose sanctions that restrict doing business in the effected countries and increased military conflict may affect third-party vendors and cause delays.\n\nThis risk may be magnified in the case of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s invasion and the ensuing response by Ukraine may disrupt our partner companies’ ability to conduct clinical trials in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia, and potentially other neighboring countries. Although the impact of Russia’s military action is highly unpredictable, certain clinical trial sites may be affected, including those of our partner company Checkpoint in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia. Those clinical trial sites may suspend or terminate trials, and patients could be forced to evacuate or choose to relocate, making them unavailable for initial or further participation in clinical trials. For instance, Checkpoint had to terminate their Phase 3 NSCLC trial in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of such conflicts. Alternative sites to fully and timely compensate for clinical trial activities in these areas may not be available, and we may need to find other countries to conduct these clinical trials. Clinical trial interruptions may delay our plans for clinical development and approvals for our product candidates, which could increase costs and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. \n\n78\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\n\nWe rely predominantly on third parties to manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on such third parties and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our product candidates and products, if approved. Further, we rely solely on third parties to manufacture Journey’s commercialized products. Such dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely impact our businesses. \n\nWe depend heavily on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to applicable specifications and FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for those products. Our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies and authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other authorities determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMPs or comparable regulations, the relevant clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material and/or applicable compliance, and commercial product could be unfit for sale, or if distributed, could be recalled from the market. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, storage, or distribution of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, pass any regulatory agency inspection or otherwise perform under our agreements with them could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. In addition, several of our currently commercialized products, sold through our partner company Journey, are produced by a single manufacturer, and, although we closely monitor inventory prophylactically, disruptions to such supply arrangements could adversely affect our ability to meet product demand and therefore diminish revenues. Finally, in light of partner company Mustang’s recent reduction in force in April 2024, we may increase our reliance at Mustang on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of one or more product candidates for which our collaborators or we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms, and even if we are able to establish such agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance entails additional risks.\n\nWe also rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the raw materials and equipment necessary to produce product candidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture those products. We do not have direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our third-party manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials since such agreements are entered into by our third-party manufacturers and their qualified suppliers. Any significant delay in the supply of raw material components related to an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.\n\n​\n\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to engage in our own commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, if they received marketing approval, and would likely continue to be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply clinical trial materials, as well as our planned dependence on third party manufacturers for any products that may be approved, may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition to the manufacturing and supply functions they provide, third-party manufacturers also play a key role in our efforts to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, by interacting with, providing important information to, and hosting inspections by, applicable regulatory authorities. If a given contract development and manufacturing organization upon whom we rely in such a capacity is unwilling or unable to perform these activities on our behalf, the successful development and/or approval of the applicable product candidate could be delayed significantly.\n\nIn addition, because of the sometimes-limited number of third parties who specialize in the development, manufacture and/or supply of our clinical and preclinical materials, we are often compelled to accept contractual terms that we deem less than desirable, including without limitation as pertains representations and warranties, supply disruptions/failures, covenants and liability/indemnification. Especially as pertains liability and indemnification provisions, because of the frequent disparities in negotiating leverage, we are often compelled to agree to low caps on counterparty liability and/or indemnification language that could result in outsized liability to us in situations where we have zero or relatively little culpability. \n\n79\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the development and manufacturing of products and product candidates.\n\nTo date, we have engaged primarily in intellectual property acquisitions, and evaluative and R&D activities and have not generated any revenues from product sales (except through Journey). We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $734.1 million, and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $694.9 million. We may need to rely on third parties for activities critical to the product candidate development process, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| identifying and evaluating product candidates;  \n---|---  \n●| negotiating, drafting and entering into licensing and other arrangements with product development partners; and  \n---|---  \n●| continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and designing and executing clinical trials.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe have also not demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our development-stage product candidates, should any of them be approved for marketing. If we were to have any such product candidates approved, the successful commercialization of such products would be dependent on us performing or contracting with third parties for performance, of a variety of critical functions, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| advising and participating in regulatory approval processes;  \n---|---  \n●| formulating and manufacturing products for clinical development programs and commercial sale; and  \n---|---  \n●| conducting sales and marketing activities.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur operations have been limited to acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of, product candidates, both at the Fortress level and via our subsidiaries and partner companies. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to develop and commercialize potential product candidates, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities.\n\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed-upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\n\nWe rely on third-party contract research organizations and site management organizations to conduct most of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, site management organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. These CROs, investigators, and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of our trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\n\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators or other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines or fails to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of the clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may lose follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those patients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash and/or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site, or the FDA’s willingness to accept such data, may be jeopardized.\n\n80\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities or potential liability. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with GLPs as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our clinical research organizations fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to accept such data, or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP in strict conformity to cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. \n\nWe also are required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\n\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party contract research organizations or site management organizations terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative contract research organizations or site management organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional contract research organizations or site management organizations involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new contract research organization or site management organization commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our contract research organizations or site management organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future.\n\nWe rely on clinical and pre-clinical data and results obtained from and by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\n\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we generally intend on developing product candidates with previously-validated mechanisms of action and seek to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical and pre-clinical data and other results produced or obtained by third parties, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable, not acceptable by regulatory authorities or not applicable to our product candidates or acquired products, we could make inaccurate assumptions and conclusions about our current or future product candidates and our research and development efforts could be compromised.\n\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and/or incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\n\nWe anticipate substantial reliance on strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our existing product candidates and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We may sell product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\n\nIf we enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will, in part, depend on the performance of research collaborators. We may not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related to product candidates. Research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, the preclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other obligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or stop performance of those agreements.\n\n81\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaboration proposals based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property positions. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product revenues that might follow are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold products. \n\nSuch collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on, and such collaborations could be more attractive than the one with us for any future product candidate.\n\nManagement of our relationships with collaborators will require:\n\n●| significant time and effort from our management team;  \n---|---  \n●| coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and  \n---|---  \n●| effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe contractual provisions we may be forced to agree upon in services, manufacturing, supply and other agreements may be inordinately one-sided, vis-à-vis current or historical standard market terms (especially as pertains contractual liability and indemnification paradigms), and as a result we may be subject to liabilities that are not attributable to our own actions or the actions of our personnel. \n\n​\n\nThere is a finite number of service providers who can perform the services or produce the materials or product candidates that we need, and we therefore often have a limited number of options in choosing such service providers. The standard market terms in many of the agreements into which we customarily enter with such service providers are subject to evolution over time, often-times in favor of our counterparties. Also, some such agreements are “adhesion contracts” under which our contractual counterparties refuse to entertain any modifications to their template documentation. One area where service providers often have and exert leverage over us is the negotiation of liability language – specifically in broadly scoped indemnification by us of service providers and/or the application of liability damages “caps” to certain of such service providers’ indemnification obligations. In any circumstance where we’ve been compelled to agree to such language, it is conceivable that we will be liable to third parties for liabilities in excess of such caps that are attributable to the actions, forbearances and/or culpability of such service providers and their indemnitees (and not to those of us and our personnel).\n\n​\n\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\n\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining patents or what the scope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\n●| patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive product candidates and their formulations and uses developed or produced by others;  \n---|---  \n●| our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners do, and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our abilities to make, use, and sell potential product candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending patent applications that we may have;  \n---|---  \n●| there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and  \n---|---  \n  \n82\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, _inter partes_ review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technologies or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. \n\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our abilities to develop and commercialize products may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as well as affect the validity, enforceability, or scope of issued patents.\n\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and their trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still come upon this same or similar information independently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors’ proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive positions would be harmed.\n\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our research and development output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given the uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or process(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or process(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for one or more product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third parties may be able to leverage our proprietary information and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\n\n83\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the US. The patent situation outside the US is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the US, and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than US law does. We might also become involved in derivation proceedings in the event that a third party misappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or more inventions. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party derived an invention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. \n\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the US and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the federal courts of the US have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter, such as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of utilizing same, which include their detection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection. \n\nSuch subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now considered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the US. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\n\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include changes to transition from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first inventor-to-file” system and to the way issued patents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a less burdensome, quicker and less expensive process for challenging issued patents. The PTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first inventor-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\n\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval (depending on the nature of the specific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect our business.\n\n84\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our licensors’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we or our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a US patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the US. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our or any of our licensors’ patent rights are highly uncertain.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party’s intellectual property rights, we may have to, among other things:\n\n●| obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;  \n---|---  \n●| abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial funds, time and resources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;  \n---|---  \n●| pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights;  \n---|---  \n●| pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or  \n---|---  \n●| defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\n\nCompetitors may infringe our or our licensors’ patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging invalidity of our or our licensors’ patents or that we infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the PTO to institute _inter partes_ review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor’s is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors’ patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could likewise put pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\n\n85\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe in-license from third parties a majority of the intellectual property needed to develop and commercialize products and product candidates. As such, any dispute with the licensors or non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\n\nThe patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights underpinning the vast majority of our existing product candidates were in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of such license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach. The licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product, and our ability to make these payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These license agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.\n\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our partners, on the one hand, and the respective licensing partner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected.\n\nThe types of disputes that may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;  \n---|---  \n●| the extent to which our technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the licensors’ right title and interest in the licensed technology and the licensors’ right to grant the licenses contemplated by such agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the rights and obligations associated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense under such license agreement;  \n---|---  \n●| the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what activities or achievements satisfy those diligence obligations;  \n---|---  \n●| whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;  \n---|---  \n●| the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual property that is the subject of such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the calculation of royalty, milestone, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| the extent to which rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;  \n---|---  \n●| whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to have occurred, is or can be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;  \n---|---  \n●| disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent expenses;  \n---|---  \n●| intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to licensed intellectual property) by our and our partners’ licensors and us and our partners; and  \n---|---  \n●| the priority of invention of patented technology.  \n---|---  \n  \n86\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or more agreements, which would make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing partners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\n\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval but do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates, if approved, generate from sales will be limited.\n\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, by third-party payors, including government payors, generally would also be necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products would depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n●| the timing of market introduction of such products as well as competitive products;  \n---|---  \n●| the clinical indications for which the product is approved;  \n---|---  \n●| acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;  \n---|---  \n●| the potential and perceived advantages of such products over alternative treatments;  \n---|---  \n●| the safety of such products in a broader patient group (i.e., based on actual use);  \n---|---  \n●| the availability, cost and benefits of treatment, in relation to alternative treatments;  \n---|---  \n●| the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for such products;  \n---|---  \n●| the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;  \n---|---  \n●| relative convenience and ease of administration;  \n---|---  \n●| the prevalence and severity of side effects and adverse events;  \n---|---  \n●| the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and  \n---|---  \n●| unfavorable publicity relating to the product.  \n---|---  \n  \n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\n\n​\n\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional limitations.\n\nWe may not be able to obtain the desired labeling claims or scheduling classifications necessary or desirable for the promotion of our marketed products (or our product candidates if approved). We may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval while our products are on the market, the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority in another jurisdiction may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be impacted or withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if approved.\n\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one or more of our product candidates or a future product candidate we may license or acquire and may have to limit their commercialization, if approved.\n\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate or product we develop, license, or acquire allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate or product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\n●| withdrawal of clinical trial participants;  \n---|---  \n●| suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;  \n---|---  \n●| decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop, license or acquire;  \n---|---  \n●| initiation of investigations by regulators;  \n---|---  \n●| impairment of our business reputation;  \n---|---  \n●| costs of related litigation;  \n---|---  \n●| substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;  \n---|---  \n●| loss of revenues;  \n---|---  \n●| reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and  \n---|---  \n●| the ability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates.  \n---|---  \n  \n88\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. When needed we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\n\nAdditionally, we have entered into various agreements under which we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\n\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them are approved.\n\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the authorized manufacturing facilities, processes and equipment, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing drug or biological products, as well as review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and requirements regarding company presentations and interactions with healthcare professionals. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or subject to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. \n\nWe also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of drug products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\n●| restrictions on product manufacturing, distribution or use;  \n---|---  \n●| restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;  \n---|---  \n●| requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n●| warning letters, untitled letters, or Form 483s;  \n---|---  \n●| recalls or other withdrawal of the products from the market;  \n---|---  \n●| refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;  \n---|---  \n●| fines;  \n---|---  \n●| suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;  \n---|---  \n●| refusal to permit the import or export of products;  \n---|---  \n●| product seizure or detentions;  \n---|---  \n●| injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and  \n---|---  \n●| adverse publicity.  \n---|---  \n  \n89\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may be subject to the actions listed above, including losing marketing approval for product candidates when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\n\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business.\n\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until the relevant governmental authority has completed a rigorous and extensive regulatory review process, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates in the U.S. will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the PTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we could lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\n\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\n\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\n\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;  \n---|---  \n●| federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;  \n---|---  \n●| HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;  \n---|---  \n  \n90\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to “covered recipients,” which include physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals) and applicable manufacturers. Applicable group purchasing organizations also are required to report annually to CMS the ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act added to the definition of covered recipient practitioners including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives effective in 2022; and  \n---|---  \n●| analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  \n---|---  \n  \nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our businesses.\n\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which could adversely affect our financial results, including without limitation the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in holding minority or non-control investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.\n\nRecent U.S. Supreme Court decisions could create uncertainty in the life sciences space that could negatively impact our business.\n\nThree decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2024 may lead to an increase in litigation against regulatory agencies that could create uncertainty and thus negatively impact our business. The first decision overturned established precedent that required courts to defer to regulatory agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. The second decision overturned regulatory agencies’ ability to impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings. The third decision extended the statute of limitations within which entities may challenge agency actions. These cases may result in increased litigation by industry against regulatory agencies and impact how such agencies choose to pursue enforcement and compliance actions. However, the specific, lasting effects of these decisions, which may vary within different judicial districts and circuits, is unknown. We also cannot predict the extent to which FDA and SEC regulations, policies, and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and changes.\n\n91\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nGeneral and Other Risks\n\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity.\n\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our intellectual property and proprietary business information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we maintain such confidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality, availability and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced elements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have access to our confidential information, which increases our disclosure risk.\n\n​\n\nWe are in the process of implementing our internal security and business continuity measures and developing our information technology infrastructure. Our internal computer systems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, third-party software, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware and other malicious code, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which could compromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\n\n​\n\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2021, our partner company Journey was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that affected its accounts payable function and led to approximately $9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to fraudulent accounts. The details of the incident and its origin were investigated with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts working at the direction of legal counsel. The matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and does not appear to have compromised any personally identifiable information or protected health information. The federal government has been able to seize a significant amount of cryptocurrency assets associated with the breach. Once the cryptocurrency has been converted back into U.S. dollars, Journey expects to receive a notification letter to initiate the return of the cash. This process could take as long as six months or more to complete. Fortress and Journey may incur additional expenses and losses as a result of this cybersecurity incident, including those related to investigation fees and remediation costs. \n\n​\n\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their systems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which could result in the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\n\n​\n\n92\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, personal information, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual property, proprietary business information, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more effectively, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures and otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. We may face increased costs and find it necessary or appropriate to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach.\n\n​\n\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party systems where information important to our business operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\n\n​\n\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop products and businesses.\n\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific, and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we continue to implement growth strategies and acquire and invest in companies with varied businesses. During our operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we continue to implement our growth strategy, the demands on our key employees will expand, and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel, or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions, could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our partners. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, and are not the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for any of our key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may occur, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our ability to continue operations.\n\n93\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with cGMPs, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal sanctions.\n\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we have in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based on such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives – especially if such disclosures are made to our competitor companies.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or other clients.\n\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether these individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used, disclosed or misappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and/or the employees or consultants that are implicated.\n\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\n\nThe stock prices of our securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n●| announcements we make regarding our current product candidates, acquisition of potential new product candidates and companies and/or in-licensing through multiple partners/affiliates;  \n---|---  \n●| sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n●| issuance of debt or other securities;  \n---|---  \n●| our delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;  \n---|---  \n●| announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;  \n---|---  \n  \n94\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| developments concerning our licensors and/or product manufacturers;  \n---|---  \n●| litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;  \n---|---  \n●| conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;  \n---|---  \n●| governmental regulation and legislation;  \n---|---  \n●| unstable regional political and economic conditions;  \n---|---  \n●| variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and  \n---|---  \n●| change in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations.  \n---|---  \n  \nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n\nSales or other issuances of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales or issuances may occur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\n\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of our Common Stock, inclusive of outstanding equity awards, are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or an effective registration statement. In addition, pursuant to our current shelf registration statements on Form S-3, from time to time we may issue and sell shares of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million. Any sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or our Series A Preferred Stock could cause a drop in the trading price of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\n\nWe will need to continue to expend capital on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of companies or products could place a strain on our management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train, and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with us and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s time and attention and distract our management from other activities related to running our business.\n\nA catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits or cause us to lose key data, which could cause us to curtail or cease operations.\n\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health epidemics and pandemics, floods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our businesses could be seriously impaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and prospects. \n\nAny of the aforementioned circumstances, may also impede our employees’ and consultants’ abilities to provide services in-person and/or in a timely manner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and trigger effectiveness of “force majeure” clauses under agreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we are obligated to achieve developmental milestones on certain timeframes. Disputes with third parties over the applicability of such “force majeure” clauses, or the enforceability of developmental milestones and related extension mechanisms in light of such business interruptions, may arise and may become expensive and time-consuming.\n\n95\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\n\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage- point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use all of its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\n\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\n\nWe, and/or third parties on our behalf, may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\n\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n\n​\n\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business or the business of our partners.\n\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\n\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough nonessential FDA employees and stop routine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nIf the timing of FDA’s review and approval of new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners’ development process may be delayed, which could result in delayed milestone revenues and materially harm our operations or business.\n\n96\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. Also, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our Securities.\n\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and appropriate corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\n\nSOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. As a result, we are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of those controls, as required by Section 404 of SOX. These efforts to comply with Section 404 and related regulations have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. While we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of Section 404, we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test the effectiveness of our control systems in the future. If a material weakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\n\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock or other Securities.\n\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers and/or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\n●| the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and  \n---|---  \n●| the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\n\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your ownership of our Securities through an acquisition.\n\n97\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from the exchange.\n\nWe have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of the Nasdaq, including rules requiring that the minimum trading price of our Common Stock not close below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If we again are unable to meet the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\n\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. For example, the United States recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\n\n​\n\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the rate of return that we realize on the investment securities that we hold.\n\n​\n\nWe customarily invest a significant portion of our cash in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) accounts, which bear interest income to us that fluctuates according to adjustments in the target federal funds rate effected by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”). The FOMC recently lowered the target federal funds rate and is anticipated by some to effect further decreases over the coming weeks and months, actions which have decreased, and could further decrease, the amount of interest income that we generate on our CDARS and on other short-term cash equivalent investment securities that we may hold.\n\n​\n\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds \n\nNone.\n\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\n\nOn July 5, 2024, Fortress announced that the Company’s Board of Directors had decided to pause the monthly dividend of $0.1953125 per share of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue to accrue and cumulate until such dividends are authorized or declared. The pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the pause should be lifted.\n\n​\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no dividends were declared by the Board of Directors. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total undeclared dividends of approximately $2.0 million, which represents the cumulated (but undeclared) dividends due to Series A Preferred shareholders on September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\nItem 4.

The words\n“anticipates,” “believes,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,”\n“should,” or “will” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology are generally intended to identify forward-looking\nstatements. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties\nthat could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those currently anticipated include those set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” including, in particular, risks\nrelating to:\n● our growth strategy;\n● financing and strategic agreements and relationships;\n● our need for substantial additional funds and uncertainties relating to financings;\n● our ability to identify, acquire, close and integrate product candidates successfully and on a timely basis;\n● our ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel;\n● the early stage of products under development;\n● the results of research and development activities;\n● uncertainties relating to preclinical and clinical testing;\n● our ability to obtain regulatory approval for products under development;\n● our ability to successfully commercialize products for which we receive regulatory approval;\n● the ability to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our and our partner companies’\nproducts and product candidates;\n● government regulation;\n● patent and intellectual property matters; and\n● competition.\nWe expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements\ncontained herein to reflect any change in our expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such\nstatement is based, except as may be required by law, and we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements\ncontained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The information contained herein is intended to be reviewed in its\ntotality, and any stipulations, conditions or provisos that apply to a given piece of information in one part of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K should be read as applying mutatis mutandis to every other instance of such information appearing herein.\n3\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. The risks described below are a\nsummary of the principal risks associated with an investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these\nrisk factors, the risk factors described in Item 1A, and the other reports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). As used below and throughout this filing (including in the risk factors described in Item 1A), the words “we”, “us”\nand “our” may refer to Fortress Biotech, Inc. individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or partner companies, or to all such entities\nas a group, as dictated by context.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development\n● Many of our product candidates are in early development stages and are subject to time and cost intensive regulation and clinical\ntesting, which may result in the identification of safety or efficacy concerns. As a result, our product candidates may never be\nsuccessfully developed or commercialized.\n● Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our product candidates’\ncommercial opportunity and profitability.\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\n● We have a history of operating losses and expect such losses to continue in the future.\n● We have funded our operations in part through the assumption of debt, and the applicable lending agreements may restrict our\noperations. Further, the occurrence of any default event under an applicable loan document could adversely affect our business.\n● Our research and development (“R&D”) programs will require additional capital, which we may be unable to raise as needed and\nwhich may impede our R&D programs, commercialization efforts, or planned acquisitions.\n● If we raise additional capital by issuing equity, equity-linked securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity\nsecurities, our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey”)\n● Our operating income derives primarily from the sale of our partner company Journey’s dermatology products, particularly\nQbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq, Zilxi, Targadox, and Exelderm. Any issues relating to the manufacture, sale, utilization, or\nreimbursement of Journey’s products (including products liability claims) could significantly impact our operating results.\n● A significant portion of Journey’s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject\nto third party generic competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing\ncompetitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. Three of Journey’s marketed\nproducts, Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, as well as DFD-29, a modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea\nlicensed from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, currently have patent protection. Three of Journey’s marketed products, Accutane,\nTargadox, and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. With respect to Journey\nproducts that are covered by valid claims of issued patents, such patents may be subject to invalidation, which would harm our\noperating income.\n● Continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our\nproducts for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including\ngovernment payors. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical\nproducts and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the\nreimbursement status of current and newly approved therapeutics.\n4\nTable of Contents\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\n● We have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our\nbusiness’ size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and\ntherapeutic categories.\n● We and our subsidiaries and partner companies have also entered into, and intend in the future to enter into, arrangements under\nwhich we and/or they have agreed to contingent dispositions of such companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate\nany such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute\nalternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. The consummation of any such arrangements with respect to certain product\ncandidates may also result in our eligibility to receive a lower portion of sales (if any) of resulting approved products than if we\nhad developed and commercialized such products ourselves.\n● Our growth and success depend on our acquiring or in-licensing products or product candidates and integrating such products into\nour businesses.\n● We may act as guarantor and/or indemnitor of certain obligations of our subsidiaries and partner companies, which could require\nus to pay substantial amounts based on the actions or omissions of said entities.\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\n● We rely heavily on third parties for several aspects of our operations, including manufacturing and developing product candidates,\nconducting clinical trials, and producing commercial product supply. Such reliance on third parties reduces our ability to control\nevery aspect of the drug development process and may hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products in a cost-\neffective and timely manner.\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\n● If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products, or if the scope of the patent protection\nobtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technologies and products similar or identical\nto ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technologies and products may be impaired.\n● We or our licensors may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation for infringement of third-party intellectual property\nrights or to enforce our or our licensors’ patents.\n● Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Pertaining to Generic Competition and Paragraph IV Litigation\n● Generic drug companies may submit applications seeking approval to market generic versions of our products.\n● In connection with these applications, generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents\nthrough litigation and/or with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). Such challenges may subject us to costly\nand time-consuming litigation and/or PTO proceedings.\n● As a result of the loss of any patent protection from such litigation or PTO proceedings, or the “at-risk” launch by a generic\ncompetitor of our products, our products could be sold at significantly lower prices, and we could lose a significant portion of\nproduct sales in a short period of time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and\nprospects.\n5\nTable of Contents\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\n● If our product candidates, if approved, are not broadly accepted by the healthcare community, the revenues from any such\nproducts are likely to be limited.\n● We may not obtain the desired product labels or intended uses for product promotion, or favorable scheduling classifications\ndesirable to successfully promote our products.\n● Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be subject to various post-marketing requirements, including studies or clinical\ntrials, the results of which could cause such products to later be withdrawn from the market.\n● Any successful products liability claim related to any of our current or future product candidates may cause us to incur substantial\nliability and limit the commercialization of such products.\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\n● We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or\nexecutive action may have on our operations.\nGeneral and Other Risks\n● We have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), and if we again\nare unable to meet the continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable to regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq\nmay decrease the market liquidity and market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business.\nOverview\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to\nenhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holding and dividend and royalty revenue streams. Fortress\nworks in concert with our extensive network of key opinion leaders to identify and evaluate promising products and product candidates for\npotential acquisition. We have executed arrangements in partnership with some of the world’s foremost universities, research institutes and\npharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Cincinnati Children’s\nHospital Medical Center, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\n(“Mayo Clinic”), AstraZeneca plc, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.\nFollowing the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress\nleverages its business, scientific, regulatory, legal and financial expertise to help the partners achieve their goals. Partner and subsidiary\ncompanies then assess a broad range of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and\ndevelopment, including joint ventures, partnerships, out-licensings, sales transactions, and public and private financings. To date, four\npartner companies are publicly-traded, and two have consummated strategic partnerships with industry leaders AstraZeneca plc as\nsuccessor-in-interest to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“AstraZeneca”) and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”), respectively.\nOur subsidiary and partner companies that are pursuing development and/or commercialization of biopharmaceutical products and product\ncandidates are Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI, “Avenue”), Baergic Bio, Inc. (“Baergic,” a subsidiary of Avenue), Cellvation, Inc.\n(“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT, “Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), Helocyte, Inc.\n(“Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM, “Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO, “Mustang”),\nOncogenuity, Inc. (“Oncogenuity”) and Urica Therapeutics, Inc. (“Urica”). Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aevitas”) was a consolidated\nsubsidiary company until the sale of its primary asset to 4D Molecular Therapeutics in April 2023.\nAs used throughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or\npartner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context. Generally, “subsidiary” refers to a private Fortress subsidiary,\n“partner company” refers to a public Fortress subsidiary, and “partner” refers to an entity with whom one of the foregoing parties has a\nsignificant business relationship, such as an exclusive license or an ongoing product-related payment obligation. The context in which any\nsuch term is used throughout this document, however, may dictate a different construal from the foregoing.\nProduct Candidates and Other Intellectual Property\nRevenue Portfolio\nThrough our partner company Journey we actively market the following branded dermatology products approved by the FDA for sale in the\nUnited States:\n● Qbrexza® (a medicated cloth towelette for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis);\n● Accutane® (an oral isotretinoin drug for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne);\n● Amzeeq® (minocycline) topical foam, 4% (a topical formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-\nnodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in adults and children nine years and older);\n● Zilxi® (minocycline) topical foam, 1.5% (a topical minocycline treatment for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults);\n7\nTable of Contents\n● Exelderm® Cream and Solution (a broad-spectrum antifungal intended for topical use);\n● Targadox® (an oral doxycycline drug for adjunctive therapy for severe acne); and\n● Luxamend® (a water-based emulsion formulated to provide an optimally moist healing environment for superficial wounds;\nminor cuts or scrapes; dermal ulcers; donor sites; first- and second-degree burns, including sunburns; and radiation dermatitis).\nAdditionally, Journey sells two authorized generic products:\n● sulconazole nitrate cream and solution, 1% antifungal agents indicated for the treatment of tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused\nby Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis,* and for the\ntreatment of tinea versicolor. *Efficacy for this organism in the organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.\nEXELDERM® Cream is also indicated for the treatment of tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Effectiveness of EXELDERM® Solution\nhas not been proven in tinea pedis; and\n● doxycycline hyclate immediate release 50mg tablets, indicated as adjunctive therapy for severe acne to reduce the development of\ndrug-resistant bacteria as well as to maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate and other antibacterial drugs.\nLate Stage Product Candidates\nCosibelimab (anti-PD-L1 antibody)\nOur partner company Checkpoint is currently developing its lead product candidate, cosibelimab, an anti-programmed death-ligand 1\n(“anti-PD-L1”) monoclonal antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in solid tumor indications. In 2017, Checkpoint\ncommenced a Phase 1 clinical trial in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers. In January 2022,\nCheckpoint announced top-line results from a cohort of this study with cosibelimab administered as a fixed dose of 800 mg every two\nweeks in patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”). The cohort met its primary endpoint, with cosibelimab\ndemonstrating a confirmed overall response (“ORR”) of 47.4% (95% CI: 36.0, 59.1) based on independent central review of 78 patients\nenrolled in the metastatic cSCC cohort using RECIST 1.1.\nIn June 2022, Checkpoint announced interim results from another cohort of this study with cosibelimab administered as a fixed dose of 800\nmg every two weeks in patients with locally advanced cSCC that are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Cosibelimab\ndemonstrated a confirmed ORR of 54.8% (95% CI: 36.0, 72.7) based on independent central review of 31 patients enrolled in the cohort.\nThe design of the interim analysis incorporated feedback from the FDA and is intended to potentially support the approval of cosibelimab\nin this indication.\nIn July 2023, Checkpoint announced longer-term results for cosibelimab from its pivotal studies in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC.\nThese results demonstrated a deepening of response over time, resulting in complete response rates of 26% and 13% in locally advanced\nand metastatic cSCC, respectively. Additionally, the confirmed ORR in metastatic cSCC increased to 50.0% based on independent central\nreview. Furthermore, responses continue to remain durable over time with the median duration of response not yet reached in either group.\nUpdated safety data across 247 patients enrolled and treated with cosibelimab in all cohorts of the ongoing study remain consistent with\nthose previously reported.\nBased on these results, Checkpoint submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)\nfor cosibelimab in January 2023. On December 15, 2023, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) for the cosibelimab BLA\nfor the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. The CRL\nonly cited findings that arose during a multi-sponsor inspection of our third-party contract manufacturing organization as approvability\nissues to address in a resubmission. The CRL did not state any concerns about the clinical data package, safety, or labeling. Following\nresolution of the inspection issues at the third-party contract manufacturing organization raised in the CRL, a resubmission of the BLA is\nplanned in 2024 to support the marketing approval of cosibelimab.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCheckpoint also previously had a collaboration agreement with TG Therapeutics, Inc. (“TGTX”) whereby TGTX was granted the rights to\ndevelop and commercialize cosibelimab in the field of hematological malignancies, while Checkpoint retained the right to develop and\ncommercialize these assets in solid tumors. Effective September 30, 2023, Checkpoint and TGTX agreed to mutually terminate these\ncollaborations, with full rights reverting back to Checkpoint.\nDFD-29 (modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea)\nThrough our partner company Journey, in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (“DRL”), we are developing DFD-29, a\nmodified release oral minocycline being evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.\nUnder the DRL arrangement, Journey is responsible for the development of DFD-29, which includes conducting two Phase 3 studies to\nassess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DFD-29 for the treatment of rosacea and the regulatory submission of a new drug application\nunder Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. DRL provides development support including the monitoring of two Phase 3 clinical trials, which\nwere initiated in the first quarter of 2022, and completed enrollment in January 2023. In July 2023, Journey announced positive topline\ndata from our two DFD-29 Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials achieved the co-\nprimary and all secondary endpoints and subjects completed the 16-week treatment and the drug was well-tolerated. DFD-29 demonstrated\nstatistical superiority over both the standard of care, Oracea® capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success\nand the reduction in the total inflammatory lesion count in both studies. Journey filed a New Drug Application (“NDA”) with the FDA for\nDFD-29 on January 4, 2024, paying a $4.0 million filing fee, and announced on March 18, 2024 that the FDA accepted the NDA and\nassigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of November 4, 2024.\nCUTX-101 (copper histidinate injection for Menkes disease)\nOur partner company Cyprium was previously developing CUTX-101, a copper histidinate injection for the treatment of Menkes disease.\nMenkes disease is a rare X-linked pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper transporter ATP7A, which affects approximately 1\nin 34,810 live male births, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on a recent genome-based ascertainment study.\nMenkes disease is characterized by distinctive clinical features, including sparse and depigmented hair (“kinky hair”), failure to thrive,\nconnective tissue disorders and severe neurological symptoms such as seizures and hypotonia. Biochemically, Menkes patients may have\nlow serum copper levels, as well as abnormal levels of catecholamine, but definitive diagnosis is typically made by sequencing of the\nATP7A gene. There is no current FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease. CUTX-101, along with an AAV-ATP7A gene therapy that is\nbeing developed by Cyprium, was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”)\nCommittee for Orphan Medicinal Products. CUTX-101 was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation by the FDA for the treatment\nof Menkes disease, Fast Track Designation for classic Menkes disease in patients who have not demonstrated significant clinical\nprogression, and Breakthrough Therapy Designation.\nIn August 2020, Cyprium reported positive top-line clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101. The study demonstrated statistically significant\nimprovement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (“ET”) with CUTX-101, compared to an\nuntreated historical control (“HC”) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median\nsurvival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.\nOn February 24, 2021, Cyprium entered into a development and asset purchase agreement (the “Sentynl APA”) with Sentynl Therapeutics,\na U.S.-based specialty pharmaceutical company owned by the Zydus Group. Under the Sentynl APA, Sentynl provided certain development\nfunding for the CUTX-101 program, with Cyprium initially remaining in control of development of such program. Pursuant to a\ncontractual right exercised by Sentynl in October 2023, however, Cyprium assigned the NDA and certain other assets pertaining to the\nCUTX-101 program to Sentynl and received $4.5 million in connection with the closing of such transaction.\nSentynl is now obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CUTX-101, including the funding of the\nsame. Additionally, Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales milestones under the\nAgreement, and royalties on net sales of CUTX-101 as follows: (i) 3% of annual net sales up to $75 million; (ii) 8.75% of annual net sales\nbetween $75 million and $100 million; and (iii) 12.5% of annual net sales in excess of $100 million. Cyprium will retain 100% ownership\nover any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued if\n9\nTable of Contents\nthe NDA for CUTX-101 is approved. The CUTX-101 rolling NDA submission is ongoing and is expected to be completed by Sentynl in\n2024.\nCyprium previously enrolled patients into an Intermediate-Size Patient Population Expanded Access Protocol which is now administered\nby Sentynl Therapeutics. Additional information on the Expanded Access study and requirements can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov using\nidentifier NCT04074512. Information on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIV Tramadol\nOur partner company Avenue is developing an intravenous formulation of tramadol (“IV tramadol”), a schedule IV opioid for the treatment\nof post-operative acute pain. Avenue completed two Phase 3 efficacy studies in 2018 and 2019 and announced that both had met their\nprimary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. In December 2019, Avenue submitted an NDA for IV tramadol to treat moderate to\nmoderately severe postoperative pain pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and following\na CRL received in October 2020, resubmitted the NDA in February 2021. The FDA assigned a PDUFA goal date of April 12, 2021 for the\nresubmitted NDA for IV Tramadol. On June 14, 2021, we announced that we had received a second CRL. We submitted a formal dispute\nresolution request (“FDRR”) with the Office of Neuroscience of the FDA on July 27, 2021. On August 26, 2021, we received an Appeal\nDenied Letter from the Office of Neuroscience of the FDA in response to the FDRR submitted on July 27, 2021. On August 31, 2021, we\nsubmitted a FDRR with the Office of New Drugs (“OND”) of the FDA. On October 21, 2021, we received a written response from the\nOND of the FDA stating that the OND needs additional input from an Advisory Committee in order to reach a decision on the FDRR.\nIn February 2022, Avenue held an Advisory Committee meeting with the FDA regarding IV tramadol. In the final part of the public\nmeeting, the Advisory Committee voted yes or no on the following question: “Has the Applicant submitted adequate information to support\nthe position that the benefits of their product outweigh the risks for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid\nanalgesic in an inpatient setting?” The results were 8 yes votes and 14 no votes. In March 2022, Avenue received an Appeal Denied Letter\nfrom the Office of New Drugs in response to the formal dispute resolution request. In August 2022, Avenue participated in a Type A\nMeeting with the FDA Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products (“DAAAP”) regarding a briefing document submitted\nthat presented a study design the Avenue believed would have the potential to address the comments and deficiencies noted in the Letter.\nIn January 2024, Avenue announced that they reached final agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 safety study protocol and statistical\nanalysis approach, including the primary endpoint. The final non-inferiority study is designed to assess the risk of opioid-induced\nrespiratory depression related to opioid stacking on IV tramadol compared to IV morphine. The study will randomize approximately 300\npost bunionectomy patients to IV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Of note, the\nsame surgical model was used in a pivotal Phase 3 Trial. In the Phase 3 safety study to be conducted, patients will have access to IV\nhydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain. The primary endpoint is a composite of elements indicative of\nrespiratory depression. Avenue plans to initiate the study as soon as possible, subject to having the necessary financing.\nOlafertinib (also known as CK-101, EGFR inhibitor for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC)\nCheckpoint is currently evaluating a lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, olafertinib, as an oral, third-generation, irreversible\nkinase inhibitor against selective mutations of epidermal growth factor receptors (“EGFR”) for the potential treatment of adult patients with\nmetastatic NSCLC, whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. Checkpoint believes that olafertinib has the potential to be\neffective in this population as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds.\nOlafertinib has FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.\nIn September 2018, Checkpoint announced preliminary interim safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. The data\nwere presented in an oral presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (“IASLC”) 19th World Conference on\nLung Cancer in Toronto. Additional information on the Phase 1 trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT02926768.\nInformation on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n10\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2020, NeuPharma, Inc. commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in China evaluating olafertinib in treatment-naïve locally\nadvanced or metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations.\nCAEL-101 (monoclonal antibody for AL amyloidosis)\nOur former subsidiary Caelum, in collaboration with AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”), is working to develop a novel, first-in-class\nmonoclonal antibody called CAEL-101 for the treatment of amyloid light chain (“AL”) amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is designed to improve\norgan function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is\ndesigned to bind to insoluble light chain amyloid protein, including both kappa and lambda subtypes and received Orphan Drug\nDesignation from the FDA as a therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis, and as a radio-imaging agent in AL amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is\ncurrently in two Phase 3 trials for AL amyloidosis and additional information on those trials can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov using\nidentifiers: NCT04512235 and NCT04504825. Information on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK.\nIn October 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Caelum for an upfront payment of approximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of\nwhich approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress, which was net of the ten percent escrow holdback amount and other miscellaneous\ntransaction expenses. The agreement also provides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders totaling up to $350 million,\npayable upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. Fortress is eligible to receive 42.4% of all possible proceeds of the\ntransaction, including approximately $148 million to Fortress, with $31.8 million upon BLA approval.\nTriplex (cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine)\nThrough our subsidiary Helocyte, we are developing Triplex, a universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine\nengineered to induce a rapid, robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to three immuno-dominant proteins (UL83 (pp65), UL123\n(IE1), and UL122 (IE2)) linked to cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) complications in the transplant setting. In a Phase 1 study, Triplex was\nobserved to be safe, well-tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered to healthy volunteers at multiple dose levels\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01941056). In a Phase 2 trial, Triplex was observed to be safe, well-tolerated, highly immunogenic and a\nreduction in CMV events in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients was observed (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02506933). Triplex\nis currently the subject of four, grant-funded trials in various clinical settings including: adults undergoing stem cell transplant; adults co-\ninfected with CMV and Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”); and in combination with a CAR T cell therapy for adults with non-\nHodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). Helocyte secured an exclusive, worldwide license to Triplex from COH in April 2015. Helocyte secured an\nexclusive, worldwide license to Triplex from COH in April of 2015. Information on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2021, Helocyte announced that a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was initiated to evaluate\nthe safety and efficacy of Triplex, a CMV vaccine, in eliciting a CMV-specific immune response and reducing CMV replication in people\nliving with HIV. The trial is being conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group and is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Disease, part of the National Institutes of Health.\nIn August 2022, Helocyte announced that Triplex received a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the\nNational Institutes of Health that could provide over $20 million in non-dilutive funding. This competitive award will fund a multi-center,\nplacebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of Triplex for control of CMV in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The company\nbelieves this data set could ultimately be used to support approval of Triplex in this setting and the trial is expected to commence in 2024.\nEarly and Mid-Stage Product Candidates\nDotinurad (urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout)\nThrough our partner company Urica, in May 2021, we acquired an exclusive license from Fuji Yakuhin Co. Ltd. (“Fuji”) to develop\ndotinurad in North America and Europe (with the exclusive licensed territory later expanded to include the Middle East and North Africa).\nDotinurad is a potential best-in-class urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout and possibly other hyperuricemic indications. Dotinurad\n(URECE® tablet) was approved in Japan in 2020 as a once-daily oral\n11\nTable of Contents\ntherapy for gout and hyperuricemia. Dotinurad was efficacious and well-tolerated in more than 500 Japanese patients treated for up to 58\nweeks in Phase 3 clinical trials. The clinical program supporting approval included over 1,000 patients.\nIn June 2023, Urica announced data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers showed comparable pharmacokinetic,\npharmacodynamic and safety profile between U.S. and Japanese healthy subjects. In the third quarter of 2023, Urica initiated a Phase 1b\nclinical trial in patients with gout and hyperuricemia in the U.S. to compare U.S. patients’ response to dotinurad with data generated in\nJapan, and to assess drug-drug interactions, if any, with allopurinol. Urica expects to announce data from this trial in the first half of 2024.\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T cell therapy)\nMustang is currently developing MB-106 in a collaboration with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“Fred Hutch”), a CD20-targeted, 3rd\ngeneration autologous CAR T-cell therapy, for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (“NHL”) and chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).\nUnder their IND, Fred Hutch is currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of\nadministering CD20-directed third-generation CAR T cells incorporating both 4-1BB and CD28 co-stimulatory signaling domains (MB-\n106) to patients with relapsed or refractory B-NHL or CLL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03277729). Secondary endpoints of this\nstudy include safety and toxicity, preliminary antitumor activity as measured by overall response rate and complete remission rate,\nprogression-free survival, and overall survival. The study is also assessing CAR T cell persistence and the potential immunogenicity of the\ncells. Fred Hutch intends to enroll approximately 50 subjects on the study, which is being led by Principal Investigator Mazyar Shadman,\nM.D., M.P.H., Assistant Member of Fred Hutch’s Clinical Research Division.\nThe Fred Hutch IND was amended in 2019 to incorporate an optimized manufacturing process that had been developed in collaboration\nwith Mustang.\nIn December 2023, Mustang announced initial data from its ongoing multicenter, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1/2 clinical trial\n(Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05360238) evaluating the safety and efficacy of MB-106 CAR-T cell therapy at the 2023 American\nSociety of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting. Initial data show that all patients responded clinically to treatment with MB-106 (n=9);\n100% overall response rate for patients with follicular lymphoma (“FL”) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (“WM”). 100% of patients\nwith FL (n=5) had a complete response; 1 very good partial response and 2 partial responses were observed in WM patients (n=3); and the\nhairy cell leukemia variant (“HCL-v”) patient experienced stable disease, with prolonged, ongoing independence from blood transfusions.\nComplete responses were observed in patients previously treated with CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. MB-106 demonstrated a\ntolerable safety profile in patients with indolent NHL, with no occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) above grade 1 and no\nimmune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS”) of any grade. Outpatient administration was allowed and found to be\nfeasible. Information on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn June 2023, Mustang announced final results from the FL cohort of the Fred Hutch Phase 1/2 clinical study, and the data showed an ORR\nof 95% (n=19/20) and complete response rate (“CR”) of 80% (n=16/20). Ten patients were in remission for over one year, seven of whom\nwere in remission for over two years. All cytokine release syndrome events were grade1 (n=5/20) or grade 2 (n=1/20) with no grade 3 or\nhigher cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) events. There was no occurrence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome\n(“ICANS”) of any grade.\nMB-101 (IL13Rα2 CAR T Cell Program for Glioblastoma)\nMustang is also currently developing MB-101 for malignant brain tumors, including glioblastoma (“GBM”). MB-101 is an optimized CAR\nT product targeting IL13Rα2 on the surface of the malignant cells and incorporates enhancements in CAR T design and T cell engineering\nto improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence.\nGBM is the most common brain and central nervous system (“CNS”) cancer, accounting for 49% of malignant primary brain and CNS\ntumors, 54% of all gliomas, and 16% of all primary brain and CNS tumors. More than 14,490 new glioblastoma cases were predicted in the\nU.S. for 2023. Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-\n12\nTable of Contents\nrelated deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year-olds in the U.S. While\nGBM is a rare disease, it is quite lethal, with five-year survival rates historically under 10%. Standard of care therapy consists of maximal\nsurgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, is shown to extend median overall\nsurvival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.\nImmunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Rα2 is an attractive target for CAR T\ntherapy, as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is over-expressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBM tumors. CAR T cells\nare designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y)\nwith high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced binding to IL13Rα1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon KS et al. Cancer\nResearch. 2004;64:9160-9166).\nHaving optimized MB-101 dose, schedule, route of administration and T cell selection in a completed Phase 1 trial, ongoing COH\nsponsored studies include:\n● MB-101 with or without nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma (currently\nenrolling patients; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04003649); and\n● MB-101 in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma with a substantial component of leptomeningeal disease\n(currently enrolling patients; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04661384).\nThe final planned MB-101 trial will be in combination with the HSV-1 oncolytic virus (MB-108) in treating patients with recurrent or\nrefractory glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. The objective of this trial is to turn immunologically “cold” tumors “hot” with MB-108\nin order to potentially enhance the efficacy of MB-101, then infuse MB-101 loco-regionally as was done in the Phase 1 single-agent MB-\n101 trial. The combination of MB-101 and MB-108 is referred to as MB-109.\nMB-108 (HSV-1 Oncolytic Virus C134 for recurrent GBM)\nMB-108 is a next-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (“oHSV”) in development at Mustang that is conditionally replication\ncompetent; that is, it is designed to replicate in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this process.\nIt was in-licensed from Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) is evaluating the safety of\nthis oncolytic virus in patients with recurrent glioblastoma in an ongoing Phase 1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03657576).\nInformation on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe rationale for in-licensing MB-108 was to potentially enhance the efficacy of MB-101 by first turning immunologically “cold”\nmalignant glioma tumors “hot” with MB-108, then infusing MB-101 loco-regionally, as was done in the phase 1 single-agent MB-101 trial.\nThis combination is to be referred to as MB-109.\nMB-109 (MB-101 (IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T Cell Therapy) + MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus))\nMustang is developing MB-109, a combination approach of MB-101 and MB-108, as a potential treatment for IL13Rα2+ relapsed or\nrefractory glioblastoma (“GBM”) and anaplastic astrocytoma (“AA”). An attractive novel approach to control glioblastoma is adoptive\ncellular immunotherapy utilizing CAR T cells. CAR T cells can be engineered to recognize very specific antigenically distinct tumor\npopulations and to migrate through the brain parenchyma to kill malignant cells. In addition, oncolytic viruses (“OVs”) have been\ndeveloped to effectively infect and kill cancer cells in the tumor, as well as modify the microenvironment to increase tumor\nimmunogenicity and immune cell trafficking within the tumor. Due to these properties, OVs have been studied in combination with other\ntreatments to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies.\nPreliminary anti-tumor activity has been observed in clinical studies administering the OV (MB-108) and CAR T cell therapy (MB-101) as\nsingle agents; however, the combination has not yet been explored. To determine if the combination of both therapies will result in a\nsynergistic effect, investigators from COH developed preclinical studies in orthotopic GBM models in nude mice. Dr. Christine Brown\nfrom City of Hope presented these preclinical studies at the American\n13\nTable of Contents\nAssociation for Cancer Research 2022 Annual Meeting. It was observed that co-treatment with MB-108 OV and IL13Rα2-directed CAR-T\ncells gave no adverse events and, more notably, that pre-treatment with MB-108 re-shaped the tumor microenvironment by increasing\nimmune cell infiltrates and enhanced the efficacy of sub-therapeutic doses of CAR-T cell therapy delivered either intraventricularly or\nintratumorally. These preclinical studies aimed to provide a deeper understanding of this combination approach to support the potential\nbenefit of a combination study that will evaluate an oHSV (MB-108) and IL13Rα2-directed CAR-T cells (MB-101).\nIn October 2023, Mustang announced that the FDA had accepted the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application of MB-109 for the\ntreatment of recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytoma. Mustang is currently planning a Phase 1 clinical study that will investigate\nincreasing doses of intratumorally administered MB-108 followed by dual intratumoral and intraventricular administration of MB-101 to\ntreat recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas that express IL13Rα2 on the surface of tumor cells.\nAJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer)\nIn February 2023, Avenue announced the license of intellectual property rights underlying AJ201 from AnnJi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.\nAJ201 is currently being studied in a Phase 1b/2a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial at six clinical sites across the U.S. for\nthe treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (“SBMA”), also known as Kennedy’s Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:\nNCT05517603). Enrollment was completed in January 2024, with topline data anticipated in the second quarter of 2024.\nSBMA is a rare, inherited, X-linked genetic neuromuscular disease primarily affecting men and AJ201 was designed to modify SBMA\nthrough multiple mechanisms including degradation of the abnormal AR protein and by stimulating Nrf1 and Nrf2, which are involved in\nprotecting cells from oxidative stress which can lead to cell death.\nAJ201 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the indications of SBMA, Huntington’s Disease, and Spinocerebellar\nAtaxia.\nMB-117 (Ex vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Newly Diagnosed X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (“XSCID”)) and MB-\n217 (Ex vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Previously Transplanted XSCID)\nIn partnership with St. Jude, Mustang’s XSCID gene therapy programs are being developed under an exclusive license to intellectual\nproperty underpinning potentially curative treatment for XSCID, a rare genetic immune system condition in which affected patients do not\nlive beyond infancy without treatment. St. Jude’s first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral (“LV”) gene therapy has been utilized in two Phase 1/2\nclinical trials involving two different autologous cell products produced via transduction of patients’ hematopoietic stem cells using a\npredecessor LV vector. These cell products were designated MB-107 and MB-207, and the respective Phase 1/2 clinical trials were: a\nmulticenter trial of the MB-107 product in newly diagnosed infants sponsored by St. Jude (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01512888;\nreferred to at St. Jude as LVXSCID-ND) and a single-center trial of the MB-207 product in previously transplanted patients sponsored by\nthe National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01306019; referred to at the NIH as LVXSCID-OC).\nGoing forward, this predecessor LV vector will be replaced by a modified LV vector which will be used to produce the MB-117 and MB-\n217 cell products. In 2024, following availability of the modified LV vector, we expect that St. Jude will initiate its Phase 1 trial to treat\nnewly diagnosed infants with MB-117 and that the NIH will initiate its Phase 1 trial to treat previously transplanted patients with MB-217.\nMB-110 (Ex Vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for RAG1 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency)\nMustang is developing MB-110, a first-in-class ex vivo treatment for recombinase-activating gene-1 (“RAG1”) Severe combined\nimmunodeficiency (“SCID”), through an exclusive license and in partnership with Leiden University Medical Centre (“LUMC”). SCID\ndue to complete recombinase-activating gene-1 (RAG1) deficiency is a rare, genetic disorder due to null mutations in the RAG1 gene\nresulting in less than 1% of wild type V(D)J recombination activity. Neonatal patients present with life-threatening, severe, recurrent\ninfections by opportunistic fungal, viral and bacterial micro-organisms, as well as skin rashes, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive and fever.\nImmunologic observations include profound T and B cell lymphopenia, low or absent serum immunoglobulins, and normal natural killer\ncell counts. As is the case with\n14\nTable of Contents\nother types of SCID, RAG1-SCID is fatal in infancy unless immune reconstitution is achieved with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n(HSCT).\nMB-110, which includes low-dose conditioning prior to reinfusion of the patients’ own gene-modified blood stem cells, is currently being\nevaluated in a Phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial in Europe. The ongoing clinical trial has enrolled its first patient, and additional clinical\nsites are expected to be added in the near future. The RAG1-SCID program has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European\nMedicines Agency.\nBAER-101 (GABA α2/3 positive allosteric modulator)\nA\nThrough Avenue’s subsidiary Baergic, we are developing BAER-101, a high affinity, selective modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid\n(“GABA”) A, which is a receptor system with differential binding and modulatory properties dependent on the particular GABA A subtype.\nBaergic intends to explore BAER-101 in a number of CNS disorders where patients are not adequately treated, including epilepsy and\nacute anxiety disorders.\nIn August 2023, Avenue reported preclinical data for BAER-101 from an in vivo evaluation in SynapCell’s Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rate\nfrom the Strasbourg (“GAERS”) model of absence epilepsy. The GAERS model mimics behavioral, electrophysiological and\npharmacological features of human absence seizures and has shown to be an early informative indicator of efficacy in anti-seizure drug\ndevelopment. In the model, BAER-101 demonstrated full suppression of seizure activity with a minimal effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg\nadministered orally. In December 2023, Avenue presented the preclinical in vivo data evaluating BAER-101 using the GAERS model of\nabsence epilepsy at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) 2023 Annual Meeting.\nPreclinical Product Candidates\nMayo Clinic In Vivo CAR T Platform Technology\nIn August 2021, Mustang announced an exclusive license agreement with the Mayo Clinic for a novel technology to create in vivo CAR T\ncells that may be able to transform the administration of CAR T therapies and has the potential to be used as an off-the-shelf therapy.\nPreclinical proof-of-concept has been established, and the ongoing development of this technology is continuing in partnership with the\nMayo Clinic.\nAAV-ATP7A Gene Therapy\nThrough our subsidiary Cyprium, we are developing adeno-associated virus (“AAV”)-based gene therapy (“AAV-ATP7A”) for the\ntreatment of Menkes disease. Cyprium entered into a license agreement with Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and\nHuman Development to acquire the global rights to develop and commercialize AAV-ATP7A gene therapy. AAV-ATP7A gene therapy has\ndemonstrated the ability to rescue neurological phenotypes and improve survival when coadministered with copper histidinate injections in\na mouse model of Menkes disease and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA.\nIn March 2024, Cyprium announced a $4.1 million grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (“NINDS”) of\nthe NIH was awarded to the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Principal Investigator, Stephen G. Kaler, M.D.,\nM.P.H., to fund the completion of preclinical studies, manufacturing, and preparation of an IND application for a first-in-human clinical\ntrial.\nAVTS-001 Gene Therapy\nIn April 2023, we announced the execution of an asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which 4D Molecular Therapeutics (“4DMT”)\nacquired Aevitas’ proprietary rights to its short-form human complement factor H (“sCFH”) asset for the treatment of complement-\nmediated diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Aevitas is eligible to receive cash payments from 4DMT totaling up to $140 million\nin potential late-stage development, regulatory and sales milestones. A range of single-digit royalties on net sales are also payable.\n15\nTable of Contents\nPrior to the agreement with 4DMT, Aevitas licensed the sCFH asset from the University of Pennsylvania and also collaborated with\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical to optimize AAV constructs.\nCK-103 (BET Inhibitor)\nCheckpoint is currently developing CK-103, a novel, selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal\n(“BET”) bromodomains. Checkpoint plans to develop CK-103 for the treatment of various advanced and metastatic solid tumor cancers,\nincluding, but not limited to, those associated with elevated c-Myc expression. Checkpoint entered into an exclusive license agreement with\nJubilant Biosys Limited to develop and commercialize novel compounds that inhibit BET bromodomains on a worldwide basis. Checkpoint\nentered into a Sublicense Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize CK-103 in the field of hematological malignancies.\nCheckpoint retains the right to develop and commercialize CK-103 in solid tumors. Currently, Checkpoint has completed the required\nCMC, pharmacology and toxicology activities that it believes will support an IND application filing.\nCEVA-D and CEVA-102\nThrough our subsidiary Cellvation, we are developing CEVA-D, a novel bioreactor device that is designed to enhance the anti-\ninflammatory potency of bone marrow-derived cells without genetic manipulation, using wall shear stress to suppress tumor necrosis\nfactor-a (“TNF-a”) production by activated immune cells. CEVA-102 is the first cell product produced by CEVA-D, and may be applicable\nfor various indications, including the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury.\nCK-302 (Anti-GITR)\nCK-302 is a fully human agonistic monoclonal antibody in development at Checkpoint that is designed to bind and trigger signaling in\nGlucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related (“GITR”) expressing cells. Scientific literature indicates GITR is a co-stimulatory molecule of the\nTNF receptor family and is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, NK and regulatory T cells. Checkpoint believes that an anti-GITR\nmonoclonal antibody has the potential to be effective in one or more oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with an\nanti-PD-L1 antibody as well as other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and targeted therapies.\nCK-303 (Anti-CAIX)\nAlso in development at Checkpoint is CK-303, a fully human anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”) antibody designed to recognize CAIX\nexpressing cells and kill them via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”).\nScientific literature indicates that CAIX is a well characterized tumor associated antigen with expression almost exclusively limited to the\ncells of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). More than 85% of RCC cases have been demonstrated to express high levels of CAIX expression.\nThere is very limited expression of this antigen on healthy tissue which Checkpoint believes will limit reactivity of this antibody against\nhealthy tissues.\nONCOlogues (Oligonucleotide Platform)\nOur subsidiary Oncogenuity is developing a delivery platform that allows peptic nucleic acids to enter a cell membrane and nucleus,\ndisplace the targeted mutant DNA strand, and prevent mutant mRNA transcription. Oncogenuity is seeking to optimize lead candidates\ntargeting genetically driven cancers, including KRAS G12D, and other genetic disorders.\nIntellectual Property Generally\nOur goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other\nproprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the\nUnited States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property\nprotection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual\narrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection\nagainst competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as\nwell as that of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for\ninventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently, and will in the future, rely on trade secret protection and\nconfidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors\nto enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure\nand assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different\nsources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and\npublic research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and\nmarketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory\napproval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in research in direct competition with\nus. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage\ncompanies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established\ncompanies.\nOur competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nproducts that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, dermatological and other\ntherapeutic areas. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products\ncan be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete\nwith other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. The principal methods of competition for our\nproducts include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts, patient access programs and product\ninsurance coverage reimbursement.\nThe only pharmaceutical area in which we sell marketed products is dermatology, and the dermatology competitive landscape is highly\nfragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC sector. Our\ncompetitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same\ndiseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology. Competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which our\nproducts are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing\nand promotional efforts.\nBranded products often must compete with therapeutically similar branded or generic products or with generic equivalents. Such\ncompetition frequently increases over time. For example, if competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with\ntherapeutic or cost advantages, our products could be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. To\nsuccessfully compete for business, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as\ncompared with other forms of care. Accordingly, we face pressure to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our\nproducts effectively.\nOur major competitors in dermatology, including Galderma Laboratories, Almirall, Ortho-Dermatologics, Mayne Pharmaceuticals, Sun\nPharma, Leo Pharma, and Arcutis Biotherapeutics, among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and\ndrug-delivery systems, among other factors.\nGeneric Competition\nOur partner company Journey faces increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit\napplications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of Journey’s products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug\ncompanies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our\nproducts (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”)\nproceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products\n(if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result. Generic versions are generally significantly less\nexpensive than branded\n17\nTable of Contents\nversions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party\nreimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces\nintense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy\nbenefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages\nas compared with other forms of care. Generic products generally face intense competition from other generic equivalents (including\nauthorized generics) and therapeutically similar branded or generic products.\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other\nthings, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion,\nadvertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are\ndeveloping.\nUnited States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical (drug and biological) products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and\nimplementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of\nobtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations\nrequire the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time\nduring the product-development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial\nsanctions. FDA compliance and enforcement actions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a\nclinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines,\nrefusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial compliance or enforcement\naction could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in\nthe United States generally includes the following:\n● completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices\n(“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations;\n● submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;\n● performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices\n(“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;\n● submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA for a new pharmaceutical product;\n● satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the\npharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”),\nto assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength,\nquality and purity;\n● potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and\n● FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.\nThe regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The process of seeking required approvals before we can\nmarket or sell a product, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of\nsubstantial resources and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product\ncandidate.\nBefore testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical\ntesting stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to\nassess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with\nfederal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with\nmanufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or\n18\nTable of Contents\nliterature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by\nthe FDA unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA\nmust resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical\nproduct candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain\nthat submission of an IND will automatically result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise\nthat causes such clinical trial to be suspended or terminated.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of\nqualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among\nother things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to\nmonitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in\naccordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or\nethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An\nIRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks\nto individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics\ncommittee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and\nmust monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to administer and\nconduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to\nconduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data\nfrom these trials. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards\ncould adversely impact the subject product development program. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases\nthat may overlap or be combined:\n● Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is usually introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects and tested for safety,\ndosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-\nthreatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically\nadminister to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.\n● Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a larger, but still limited patient population to identify possible adverse\neffects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine\ndosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.\n● Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient\npopulation at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish safety and efficacy, the\noverall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, it has been the FDA’s\nposition that Congress intended at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials for approval of an NDA or\nBLA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.\nPost-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be required after initial receipt of marketing approval. These studies are used to gain\nadditional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA after it has been\napproved, and is on the market, as an ongoing condition of approval.\nProgress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports\nmust be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory\nanimals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully\nwithin any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any\ntime on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\nSimilarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being\nconducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with\nunexpected serious harm to patients.\n19\nTable of Contents\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about\nthe chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in\ncommercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing\nquality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength,\nquality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected, tested and stability studies\nmust be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nUnited States Review and Approval Process\nThe data and results generated from product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the\nmanufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other required\ninformation are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA submission before the product can be marketed and sold.\nThe review and approval process for an NDA or BLA is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may not approve an NDA or BLA if the\napplicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or if the data and results in the submission are insufficient to support a finding of safety and\nefficacy, FDA may also require additional clinical data or other data and information to address deficiencies in an application. Even if such\ndata and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Even if a\nproduct receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited with respect to dosages, indications for use, or other label\nclaims related to those disease states, conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective and, which could\nrestrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be\nincluded in the product labeling. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA\nand are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs, which impose additional regulatory\nrequirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our suppliers will be able to fully comply with the\ncGMPs or other FDA regulatory requirements.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nAny pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing postmarket regulation by the FDA, including,\namong other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated\nsafety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature\nrequirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-\nconsumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical\nproduct’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities\ninvolving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, compliance\nand enforcement actions initiated by the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal\npenalties. The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved\nproduct or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.\nSpecial FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs\nThe FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough therapy\ndesignation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the\ntreatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose\nof these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for fast\ntrack designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening\ndisease or condition and based on preclinical or preliminary clinical data demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The\nFDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that\nmay be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate\ntherapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of\nten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the\nreceipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision\nfrom the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a\npriority review.\nIn addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful\ntherapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-\ncontrolled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit,\nor on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect\non irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the\navailability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated\napproval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other\nclinical endpoint and under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to require, as\nappropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted\naccelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or\nindication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the\nproduct. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials, which\ncould adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nMoreover, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug\nthat is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and\npreliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more\nclinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as\nbreakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding\ntimely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough\ntherapy.\nAdditionally, under FDORA, a platform technology incorporated within or utilized by a drug or biological product is eligible for\ndesignation as a designated platform technology if (1) the platform technology is incorporated in, or utilized by, a drug approved under an\nNDA; (2) preliminary evidence submitted by the sponsor of the approved or licensed drug, or a sponsor that has been granted a right of\nreference to data submitted in the application for such drug, demonstrates that the platform technology has the potential to be incorporated\nin, or utilized by, more than one drug without an adverse effect on quality, manufacturing, or safety; and (3) data or information submitted\nby the applicable person indicates that incorporation or utilization of the platform technology has a reasonable likelihood to bring\nsignificant efficiencies to the drug development or manufacturing process and to the review process. A sponsor may request the FDA to\ndesignate a platform technology as a designated platform technology concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND\napplication for a drug that incorporates or utilizes the platform technology that is the subject of the request. If so designated, the FDA may\nexpedite the development and review of any subsequent original NDA for a drug that uses or incorporates the platform technology.\nDesignated platform technology status does not ensure that a drug will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.\nEven if a product candidate or our platform qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product\ncandidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nFurthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the\nstandards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.\nSection 505(b)(2) Regulatory Approval Pathway\nSection 505(b)(2) was added to the Act by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments). Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway for approval of a new\n21\nTable of Contents\ndrug by allowing the FDA to rely on data not developed by the applicant. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA\nwhere one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which\nthe applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and/or the FDA’s findings of safety and\neffectiveness for an approved drug already on the market. Approval or submission of a 505(b)(2) application, like those for abbreviated\nnew drugs, or ANDAs, may be delayed because of patent and/or exclusivity rights that apply to the previously approved drug.\nUnder the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, the applicant may reduce some of the burdens of developing a full clinical program by\nrelying on investigations not conducted by the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, such as prior\ninvestigations involving the listed drug. In such cases, some clinical trials may not be required or may be otherwise limited.\nA 505(b)(2) application may be submitted for a new chemical entity (NCE), when some part of the data necessary for approval is derived\nfrom studies not conducted by or for the applicant and when the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such data are typically\nderived from published studies, rather than FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness of a previously approved drug. For changes\nto a previously approved drug however, an applicant may rely on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness of the approved drug,\ncoupled with information needed to support the change from the approved drug, such as new studies conducted by the applicant or\npublished data. When based on an approved drug, the 505(b)(2) drug may be approved for all of the indications permitted for the approved\ndrug, as well as any other indication supported by additional data.\nSection 505(b)(2) applications also may be entitled to marketing exclusivity if supported by appropriate data and information. As discussed\nin more detail below, three-year new data exclusivity may be granted to the 505(b)(2) application if one or more clinical investigations\nconducted in support of the application, other than bioavailability/ bioequivalence studies, were essential to the approval and conducted or\nsponsored by the applicant. Five years of marketing exclusivity may be granted if the application is for an NCE, and pediatric exclusivity is\nlikewise available.\nOrange Book Listing and Paragraph IV Certification\nFor NDA submissions, including 505(b)(2) applications, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover\nthe applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application is published in Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who subsequently files an ANDA or a\n505(b)(2) application that references a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug\nproduct that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent\nexpires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the\napplication is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification.\nIf an applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification\nto the holder of the NDA for the approved drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The\nNDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The\nfiling of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the\nANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, the applicant’s successful defense of the suit, or\nexpiration of the patent.\nOrphan Drugs\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to\ninclude those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Requests for orphan drug designation must\nbe submitted before the submission of an NDA or BLA.\nIf a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such\ndesignation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not\napprove any other applications to market the same drug that designated orphan use, except in\n22\nTable of Contents\nlimited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another person if the FDA determines that the\napplication is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the\nholder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. If the\nFDA approves someone else’s application for the same drug that has orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could\nbe prescribed by physicians outside its FDA approval for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an\norphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there\ncan be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or\nother uses.\nU.S. Marketing Exclusivity and Patent Term Extensions\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible\nfor limited patent term extension (“PTE”) under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred\nto as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a PTE of up to five years as compensation for patent term\nlost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent\nbeyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The PTE period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an\nIND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only\none patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the\nexpiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In\nthe future, we intend to apply for PTE for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration\ndate, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.\nMarketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The\nFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA\nfor a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same\nactive moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may\nnot accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug\nbased on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for\nanother indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an\napplication may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents\nlisted with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or\nsupplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the\napplicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an\nexisting drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical\ninvestigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or\ncondition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant\nsubmitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-\ncontrolled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-\nyear period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity\nin the U.S. which, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods for all formulations, dosage forms, and indications of the\nactive moiety and patent terms. This six month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be\ngranted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA issued “Written Request” for such a trial,\nprovided that at the time pediatric exclusivity is granted there is not less than nine months of term remaining.\nPediatric Information\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs and BLAs or supplements to NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the\nsafety and effectiveness of the treatment for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and\nadministration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the treatment is safe\n23\nTable of Contents\nand effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation,\nPREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.\nThe Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a\nproduct if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a\nnew drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies,\nand the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within a specific time frame.\nDEA Regulation\nThe Controlled Substances Act (CSA) imposes various registration, record-keeping and reporting requirements, procurement and\nmanufacturing quotas, labeling and packaging requirements, security controls, prescription and order form requirements and restrictions on\nprescription refills for certain kinds of pharmaceutical products. A principal factor for determining the particular requirements of the CSA\napplicable to a product, if any, is its actual or potential abuse profile, which is classified into a DEA schedule. A product may be listed as a\nSchedule I, II, III, IV or V controlled substance, with Schedule I presenting the highest perceived risk of abuse and Schedule V presenting\nthe least.\nAnnual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance and\nregistration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.\nThe DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security\nrequirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II controlled\nsubstances and less stringent requirements for Schedules III, IV, and V. Required security measures include background checks on\nemployees and physical control of inventory through measures such as vaults and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained\nfor the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any\ncontrolled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits\nthe availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must\nalso be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA.\nTo enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances.\nFailure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative,\ncivil or criminal enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate administrative\nproceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.\nIn addition to federal scheduling, some drugs may be subject to state-controlled substance regulation and thus more extensive requirements\nthan those determined by the DEA and FDA.\nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\nIn the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA,\nincluding the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice,\nthe DEA and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.\nWe will also be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact,\namong other things, our proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation\nby both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n● The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting,\nreceiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or\n24\nTable of Contents\nreward, or in return for, either (1) the referral of an individual to a person for furnishing any item or service for which payment is\navailable under a federal health care program, or (2) the purchase, lease, order or recommendation thereof of any good, facility,\nservice or item for which payment is available under a federal health care program;\n● The False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly\npresenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government or making or using, or\ncausing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n● The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes\nthat prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, obtaining money or property of the health care benefit\nprogram through false representations or knowingly and willingly falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making\nfalse statements or using or making any false or fraudulent document in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health\ncare benefits or services;\n● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its\nimplementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually\nidentifiable health information;\n● The provision under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires applicable\nmanufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to track and annually report to CMS payments and other\ntransfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians\nor their immediate family members in applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations; applicable manufacturers are\nalso required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided, as well as ownership and investment\ninterests held, to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-\nmidwives; and\n● State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and state laws\nconcerning security and privacy of health care information, which may differ in substance and application from state-to-state\nthereby complicating compliance efforts.\nThe ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-\nKickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the\nstatutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to\nhave committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting\nfrom a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the\ncivil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the\nreferral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nPharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\nIn the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will\ndepend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities,\nmanaged care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical\nnecessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant\nuncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available\nfor any products for which we obtain regulatory approval to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and\nproduct development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including the\nACA. The ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage\ncriteria and additional downward pressure on the payments received for any approved drug. Any\n25\nTable of Contents\nreduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs result in a similar reduction in payments from private\npayors. We are unable to predict what these changes may look like in the future.\nInternational Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, pricing and\nreimbursement, and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. Importantly, the level of evidence of efficacy and safety\nnecessary to apply for marketing authorization for a drug candidate differs from country to country, the approval process also varies from\ncountry to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Typically, if a foreign regulatory authority is\nsatisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a\nmarketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with\nFDA approval discussed above, and therefore there are no guarantees that any company will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing\nauthorization for any product in any particular country.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 186 full-time employees at Fortress and our subsidiaries and partner companies. None of our employees\nis represented by a labor union. We have retained a number of expert advisors and consultants who help navigate us through different\naspects of our business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages,\nslowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.\nOur human capital management objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our new\nand existing employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees,\nconsultants, and directors through the granting of share-based compensation awards and cash-based bonus awards.\nExecutive Officers of Fortress\nThe following table sets forth certain information about our executive officers as of December 31, 2023.\nName Age Position\nLindsay A.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Common Stock, our 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock $0.001 par value (the “Series A\nPreferred Stock”) or any other type of equity or debt securities we may issue from time to time (together, our “Securities”) involves a high\ndegree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as the risks, uncertainties and\nother information set forth in the reports and other materials filed or furnished by our partner companies Avenue, Checkpoint, Journey and\nMustang with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our Securities. If any of the following risks or the risks included in the public filings of\nAvenue, Checkpoint, Journey or Mustang were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth\nprospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Securities could decline, and you could lose\npart of or all of your investment in our Securities. In addition, you should be aware that the below stated risks should be read as being\napplicable to our subsidiaries and partner companies such that, if any of the negative outcomes associated with any such risk is\nexperienced by one of our subsidiaries or partner companies, the value of Fortress’ holdings in such entity may decline. As used\nthroughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more subsidiaries and/or partner\ncompanies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development\nMost of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized, and\nthe product candidates that do advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nMost of our existing product candidates remain in the early stages of development and will require substantial further capital expenditures,\ndevelopment, testing and regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval processes can take\nmany years, and it is unlikely that our product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA and/or foreign\nequivalent regulatory bodies, would be commercially available for several years. Only a small percentage of drugs under development\nsuccessfully obtain regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite\nfinancing to fund development programs, we cannot be sure that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or\ncommercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. Before we may seek regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product\ncandidates, we will be required to demonstrate, through well-controlled clinical trials, that our product candidates are effective and have a\nfavorable benefit-risk profile for their target indications. Success in early clinical trials is not necessarily indicative of success in later stage\nclinical trials, during which product candidates may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy, despite having progressed through\ninitial clinical testing, which may cause significant setbacks. Further, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently\nanticipated. As a result, product candidates that we advance into clinical trials may never receive regulatory approval.\nEven if any of our product candidates are approved, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates for fewer or more\nlimited indications than we request, may place limitations on our ability to commercialize products at the intended price points, may grant\napproval contingent on the product’s performance in costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a label that does not include the\nclaims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. The regulatory authority may also require the\nlabel to contain warnings, contraindications, or precautions that limit the commercialization of the product. In addition, the Drug\nEnforcement Agency (“DEA”), or foreign equivalent, may schedule one or more of our product candidates under the Controlled Substances\nAct, or its foreign equivalent, which could impede such product’s commercial viability. Any of these scenarios could impact the\ncommercial prospects for one or more of our current or future product candidates.\nThe extensive regulation to which our product candidates are subject may be costly and time consuming, cause anticipated delays,\nand/or prevent the receipt of the required approvals for commercialization.\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export,\nmarketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to\n28\nTable of Contents\nextensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are\nnot permitted to market a product candidate until the FDA approves such product candidate’s BLA or NDA. The approval process is\nuncertain, expensive, often spans many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product\ncandidates involved. In addition to significant and expansive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for\nproduct candidates depends on the results of required non-clinical testing, including the characterization of the manufactured components\nof our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes,\ntesting procedures or equipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Further, the FDA has substantial discretion in the\npharmaceutical approval process and may change approval policies or interpretations of regulations at any time, which could delay, limit or\npreclude a product candidate’s approval.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies may delay, limit or refuse approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not\nlimited to:\n● disagreement with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials, including proper use of clinical trial methods and\nmethods of data analysis;\n● an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and/or effective for an\nindication;\n● the FDA’s rejection of clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is\npotentially different from that of the United States;\n● the FDA’s determination that clinical trial results do not meet the statistical significance levels required for approval;\n● a disagreement by the applicable regulator regarding the interpretation of preclinical study or trial data;\n● determination by the FDA that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or\nour collaborators contract for clinical supplies or plan to contract for commercial supplies, do not satisfactorily comply with\ncGMPs; or\n● a change to the FDA’s approval policies or interpretation of regulations rendering our clinical data, product characteristics, or\nbenefit-risk profile insufficient or unfavorable for approval.\nForeign approval procedures vary by country and may, in addition to the aforementioned risks, involve additional product testing,\nadministrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological development during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and may result in increased\ncautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other\nregulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to\nobtain, applicable regulatory approvals may prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials, or suspensions or terminations of such trials, could result in increased costs and/or\ndelay our ability to pursue regulatory approvals.\nThe commencement or resumption of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays\nin:\n● obtaining regulatory approval to commence or resume a clinical trial;\n● identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n29\nTable of Contents\n● reaching and maintaining agreements on acceptable terms with CROs and trial sites, the terms of which may be subject to\nextensive negotiation and modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n● obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n● obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n● developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;\n● adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;\n● the death, disability, departure or other change to the principal investigator or other staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given\nsite;\n● identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or\n● retaining patients who participate in a clinical trial and replacing those who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy,\ninsufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In\naddition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the\ntermination of a given development program or the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf any of our product candidates causes unacceptable adverse safety events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory\napproval or commercialize such product, preventing us from generating revenue from such products’ sale. Alternatively, even if a product\ncandidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could lead to the withdrawal of such product from the market.\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and/or delay or prevent our ability to complete\ndevelopment of that product candidate or generate product revenues.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial\nplan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also\nbe delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in\naccordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an\nIRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site,\nor the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n● inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition\nof a clinical hold;\n● stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n● unforeseen safety or chemistry, manufacturing and control issues, or other determination that the clinical trial presents\nunacceptable health risks; and\n● lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory requirements and guidance may change, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Any such\nchange may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs, which may in turn impact a clinical trial’s cost, timing, and likelihood of\nsuccess. If any clinical trial is delayed, suspended, or terminated, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be\ndelayed, and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer. In addition, many of these factors may ultimately lead\nto the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates’ target indications and those competitor products are approved\nmore quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidates\nwill be reduced or eliminated.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face,\ncompetition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research\ninstitutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug\ntechnologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. Any of these\ndevelopments may render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial\nopportunity for one or more of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative\nformulations outside the scope of our in-licensed patents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n● capital resources;\n● development resources, including personnel and technology;\n● clinical trial experience;\n● regulatory experience;\n● expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and\n● manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing capabilities.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we are able to, or may\nobtain patent protection or other intellectual property or exclusivity rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of\nour product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, safe, useful and/or less costly than ours and may\nbe more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be\nsignificant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We will also face\ncompetition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient registration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-\nlicensing new product candidates.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage\npublic perception of our product candidates, or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for\nour product candidates.\nIf any of the technologies underpinning our product candidates, including gene therapy, is claimed to be unsafe, such product candidate\nmay not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The success of our gene therapy platforms in particular depends upon\nphysicians who specialize in treating the diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments involving our product\ncandidates in lieu of, or in addition to, treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available.\nMore restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and\nmay delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop.\nAdverse events in our clinical\n31\nTable of Contents\ntrials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental\nregulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter\nlabeling requirements for those product candidates that do obtain approval and/or a decrease in demand for any such product candidates.\nConcern about environmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated, may also hinder the commercialization of our products.\nThe making, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances are subject to regulation by state, federal and\nforeign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies.\nControlled substances are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation,\nexportation and distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”) and\nregulations of the DEA. IV tramadol, under development by our partner company Avenue, will be subject to these regulations.\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high\npotential for abuse and no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may\nbe listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances\nthe lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.\nVarious states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because\nthe states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the\nDEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled\nsubstance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness\nof such product. We or our collaborators must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute\ncontrolled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to\nenforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nFor any of our products classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are\nrequired to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and\ncomply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution\nof controlled substances. There is a risk that DEA regulations may limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials for our product\ncandidates and the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to both meet commercial demand and build\ninventory to mitigate possible supply disruptions.\nRegulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and\nprocurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the\nexpense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some\nstates, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required\nregistrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product\ncandidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew\nnecessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal\nproceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of any of our product candidates that are\nclassified as controlled substances, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results\nof operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\nThe FDA limits regulatory approval for our product candidates to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and\nefficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases set forth in the approval for\nwhich a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new\nindication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain\n32\nTable of Contents\nFDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced\nand our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s label or that differ from those tested in clinical studies\nand approved by the regulatory authorities (“off label uses”), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are\nspecifically approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment\nfor some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the practice of medicine or behavior\nof physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies\nregarding the promotion of off-label use.\nIf our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement actions,\nincluding Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines\nrelating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall,\ninstitute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution,\nany of which could harm our business.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that a product candidate satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway,\nor if the requirements for such product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for the product\ncandidate will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than\nanticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to\nthe FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies\nthat were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if\napplicable to us under the FDCA, would allow an NDA we submit to FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA’s prior\nconclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product\ncandidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the\nFDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials,\nprovide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial\nresources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these product\ncandidates, would likely substantially increase. We could need to obtain more additional funding, which could result in significant dilution\nto the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure\nyou that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section\n505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would likely result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product\ncandidates, which would likely materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the\nSection 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for\ncommercialization in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain\nbrand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s\ninterpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which\ncould delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical\nindustry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of\nsponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent\nlitigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not\nuncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose\nadditional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the\napproval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while\nit considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no\nguarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval.\n33\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated\nuses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing\ntesting and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\nWe have historically financed a significant portion of our growth and operations in part through the assumption of debt. Should an\nevent of default occur under any applicable loan documents, our business would be materially adversely affected. Further, our current\ncredit arrangement with Oaktree restricts our and certain of our subsidiaries’ and partner companies’ abilities to take certain actions.\nAt December 31, 2023, the total amount of debt outstanding, net of the debt discount, was $60.9 million. If we default on our obligations,\nthe holders of our debt may declare the outstanding amounts immediately payable together with accrued interest, and/or take possession of\nany pledged collateral. If an event of default occurs, we may be unable to cure it within the applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity\nof our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment and we may be unable to borrow or obtain\nsufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, current or future debt obligations\nmay limit our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs, or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. Such\nrestrictions may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay\nthe outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nOn August 27, 2020, we entered into a $60 million senior secured credit agreement (the “Oaktree Agreement” and the debt thereunder, the\n“Oaktree Note”) with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, “Oaktree”). At\nDecember 31, 2023 the amount outstanding under the Oaktree Agreement was $50 million. The Oaktree Agreement contains certain\naffirmative and negative covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ abilities to take certain actions, especially as pertains\nindebtedness, liens, investments, affiliate transactions, acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, dividends and\nother distributions (subject in each case to exceptions). The Oaktree Agreement also contains financial covenants obligating us to maintain\na minimum liquidity amount and a minimum amount of revenue, in both cases subject to exceptions. The breach of any such provisions\n(even, potentially, in an immaterial manner) could result in an event of default under the Oaktree Agreement, the announcement and impact\nof which could have a negative impact on the trading prices of our securities. The restrictions imposed by such provisions may also inhibit\nour and certain of our subsidiaries and partner companies’ ability to enter into certain transactions or arrangements that management\notherwise believes would be in our or such partner companies’ best interests, such as dispositions that would result in cash inflows to\nFortress and/or our subsidiaries and partner companies, or acquisitions or financings that would promote future growth.\nWe have a history of operating losses that is expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we\nwill be able to sustain current revenues or whether we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $142.3 million and $203.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of\napproximately $694.9 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the\nfuture, and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product\ncandidates and finance investments in certain of our existing and new subsidiaries in accordance with our growth strategy. Our losses have\nhad, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders’ equity.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or\namount of increased expenses or when or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter\nto quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n● one or more of our development-stage product candidates is approved for commercial sale and we decide to commercialize such\nproduct(s) ourselves, due to the need to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this\nproduct without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel\n34\nTable of Contents\nand contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial\nactivities;\n● we are required by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;\n● there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;\n● we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, depending on the timing of payments we may make or receive\nunder these arrangements;\n● there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n● we become involved in any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits; and\n● there are any regulatory developments affecting our competitors’ product candidates.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our\ndevelopment stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from such development-stage products. Our\nability to generate revenue from such development-stage products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability\nto:\n● obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or\nacquire in the future;\n● manufacture commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, at\nacceptable cost levels; and\n● develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our\nproduct candidates or any future product candidate, if approved.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to\nbecome and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business,\nmaintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations, which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our\nSecurities to decline. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nTo fund our operations and service our debt securities, which may be deemed to include our Series A Preferred Stock, we will be\nrequired to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock\nto decline.\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to\nmake payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative\nfinancing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise\nadditional capital. Alternatively, as we have done in the past, we may also elect to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend\nmaturities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we\nare unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets or our own financial condition or\nreputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher\ninterest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability\nto generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially\n35\nTable of Contents\nreasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations\nand could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by Journey and its ability to make such cash available to\nus, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Journey may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to\nmake payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries, including Journey, is a distinct legal entity and, under certain\ncircumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nOur ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to\naccess the capital markets to refinance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing\nour debt will result in a reduction in the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital\nexpenditures that could improve our competitive position and results of operations.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or\neliminate one or more of our R&D programs, commercialization efforts or planned acquisitions and potentially change our growth\nstrategy.\nOur R&D programs will require substantial additional capital for research, preclinical testing and clinical trials, establishing pilot scale and\ncommercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establishing and developing quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, and\nadministrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from\nroyalties and milestones from our partners in various past, ongoing, and future collaborations, and through additional equity or debt\nfinancings from third parties. These financings could depress the trading prices of our Securities. If additional funds are required to support\nour operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact\nour growth strategy.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we\nincurred R&D expenses of approximately $101.7 million and $134.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant\namounts on our growth strategy. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to continue to fund operations in the\nnormal course of business for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Until such time, if ever, as\nwe can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential cash needs.\nUnder current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so\nlong as our public float remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-\nmonth period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the “baby\nshelf rules.” SEC regulations permit us to use the highest closing sales price of our common stock (or the average of the last bid and last\nask prices of our common stock) on any day within 60 days of sales under the registration statement to calculate our public float.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, for sales following the date of this Form 10-K, and\nuntil we again have a public float with a value in exceeds of $75 million, if ever, we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of\nour public float under shelf registration statements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the amount of securities we\nmay sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statements will also decrease.\nOur ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs,\nthe acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures, acquisitions and growth strategy, increased expenses or other\nevents may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner or on different terms than\nanticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more\nof our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial\n36\nTable of Contents\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline. The terms of our existing debt\narrangements, including that with Oaktree, have and will continue to inhibit our and our subsidiaries’ abilities to raise capital.\nWe may be unable to generate returns for our investors if our partner companies and subsidiaries, several of which have limited or no\noperating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products or, if not yet profitable, cannot obtain additional third-party\nfinancing.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial financial and operational commitments in our\nsubsidiaries, which often have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional\nthird-party financing to fund product and services development or acquisitions. Our business depends in large part on the ability of one or\nmore of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies to innovate, in-license, develop or acquire successful biopharmaceutical products and/or\nacquire companies in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If certain of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies do not\nsuccessfully obtain additional third-party financing to commercialize products, or are not acquired in change-of-control transactions that\nresult in cash distributions, as applicable, the value of our businesses and our ownership stakes in our partner companies may be materially\nadversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations\nand could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing\nstockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing Common Stock (or other Securities that are convertible into or exercisable for\nshares of Common Stock), the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have also entered into financing arrangements\nto raise capital for our subsidiaries under which Common Stock is or may be issuable to investors in lieu of cash, upon certain conditions\nbeing met; in the event such issuances take place, they will also be dilutive of the stakes of existing stockholders. Any future debt\nfinancings may impose covenants that restrict our operations, including by limiting our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay\ndividends, redeem our stock, make certain financial commitments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions,\namong other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing or sublicensing arrangements, it may be necessary to\nrelinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation\nFuture revenue based on sales of our dermatology products, Qbrexza, Accutane, Amzeeq, Zilxi, Targadox, Exelderm and Luxamend,\nmay be lower than expected or lower than in previous periods.\nThe vast majority of our operating income for the foreseeable future is expected to come from the sale of our dermatology products through\nour partner company Journey. Any setback that may occur with respect to such products could significantly impair our financial condition,\ncash flows and/or operating results and/or reduce the value of our Securities. Setbacks for such products could include, but are not limited\nto, issues related to: supply chain, shipping; distribution; demand; manufacturing; product safety; product quality; marketing; government\nregulation, including but not limited to pricing or reimbursement; licensing and approval; intellectual property rights; competition with\nexisting or new products, including third-party generic competition; product acceptance by physicians, other licensed medical\nprofessionals, and patients; and higher than expected total rebates, returns or recalls. Also, a significant portion of Journey’s sales derive\nfrom products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic competition; the introduction of\nnew competitor products, or increased market share of existing competitor products, could have a significant adverse effect on our\noperating income.\nWe face challenges as our products face generic competition and/or losses of exclusivity.\nJourney’s products do and may compete with well-established products, both branded and generic, with similar or the same indications. We\nface increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to\nmarket generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the\nvalidity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents\n37\nTable of Contents\ncovering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a\ngeneric company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable)\nexpires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result.\nA significant portion of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party\ngeneric competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of\nwhich could have a significant adverse impact on our operating income. Three of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, as\nwell as one of our product candidates, DFD-29, currently have patent protection. Three of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, and\nExelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. Accutane currently competes in the Isotretinoin\nmarket with five other therapeutically equivalent A/B rated products. Targadox currently competes with one therapeutically equivalent A/B\nrated generic product. Exelderm may face A/B rated generic competition in the future.\nGeneric versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized\nbefore or in preference to the branded version by third-party payors, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product\nloses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for\nbusiness with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only\nmedical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Any reduction in sales of our products or the prices we\nreceive for our products as a result of generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash\nflows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities to decline.\nAny disruptions to the capabilities, composition, size or existence of Journey’s field sales force may have a significant adverse impact on\nour existing revenue stream. Further, our ability to effectively market and sell any future products that we may develop and for which\nwe receive marketing authorization, will depend on our ability to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or to enter\ninto agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any such products.\nJourney’s field sales force has been and is expected to continue to be an important contributor to our commercial success. Any disruptions\nto our relationship with such field sales force or the professional employer organization that employs our field sales force, could materially\nadversely affect our product sales. Journey currently relies, and may continue to rely, on professional employer organizations and staffing\norganizations for the employment of its field sales force.\nThe establishment, development, and/or expansion of a field sales force, either by us or certain of our partners or vendors, or the\nestablishment of a contract field sales force to market any products for which we may have or receive marketing approval is expensive and\ntime-consuming and could delay any such product launch or compromise the successful commercialization of such products. If we are\nunable to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any\nproducts that may be successfully developed, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be\nable to establish or maintain arrangements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf our products are not included in managed care organizations’ formularies or coverage by other organizations, our products’\nutilization and market shares may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial\ncondition.\nIn the United States, continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit\ntherapy, of our products for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including\ngovernment health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors\nare increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and\nefficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-\nparty reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment of our currently\nmarketed products or those which we may acquire or develop in the future.\n38\nTable of Contents\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs.\nManaged care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies\nare based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The\nbreadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies\ninclude alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical conditions. Failure to be included in such formularies or to\nachieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our products. If our products are not included\nwithin an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic\nproducts, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause\nthe market value of our Securities to decline.\nReimbursement for our products and product candidates may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments, which could make\nit difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nWe have obtained approval for some products, and intend to seek approval for other product candidates, to commercialize in both the\nUnited States and in countries and territories outside the United States. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign countries, we will be\nsubject to rules and regulations in those countries relating to such products. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union,\nthe pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with\ngovernmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, market\nacceptance and sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and\nreimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform\nmeasures.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which\npharmaceuticals they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of\nfactors, including the third-party payor’s determination regarding whether a product is:\n● a covered benefit under its health plan;\n● safe, effective and medically necessary;\n● appropriate for the specific patient;\n● cost-effective; and\n● experimental or investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly\nprocess that could require that we provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor.\nWe may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our\nfuture products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or\nsustain profitability. Additionally, while we may seek approval of our product candidates in combination with each other, there can be no\nguarantee that we will obtain coverage and reimbursement for any of our products together, or that such reimbursement will incentivize the\nuse of our products in combination with each other as opposed to in combination with other agents which may be priced more favorably to\nthe medical community.\nLegislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare systems of the United States and certain foreign countries could impact our ability to\nsell our products profitably. Several federal agencies including FDA, CMS, DEA and HHS, in addition to state and local governments,\nregulate drug product development and marketing. In particular, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of\n2003 (“MMA”) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products by revising the payment methodology for many\nproducts reimbursed by Medicare, resulting in lower rates of reimbursement for many types of drugs, and added a prescription drug benefit\nto the Medicare program that involves commercial plans negotiating drug prices for their members. In addition, this law provided authority\nfor limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions\n39\nTable of Contents\nof this law and future laws could decrease the coverage and price that we will receive for any approved products. While the MMA only\napplies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in\nsetting their own payment rates. Therefore, any limitations in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in reductions in\npayments from private payors.\nSince 2003, there have been several other legislative and regulatory changes to the coverage and reimbursement landscape for\npharmaceuticals. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA,” was enacted and made significant changes to the United\nStates’ healthcare system. The ACA and any revisions or replacements of that Act, any substitute legislation, and other changes in the law\nor regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the United States there is significant interest in containing healthcare costs and increasing the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing\npractices. Congress has continually explored legislation intended to address the cost of prescription drugs. Notably, the Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022 contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain\nselected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs\npayable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts\non Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for\nour products, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general\nis not yet known.\nWhile we cannot predict what additional proposals may ultimately become law, the elements under consideration could significantly\nchange the landscape in which the pharmaceutical market operates.\nState legislatures are similarly active in proposing and passing legislation and regulations aimed at controlling pharmaceutical and\nbiological prices and drug cost transparency.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of\nhealthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs. We cannot predict the\ninitiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations\nand other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and prescription drugs may adversely affect:\n● the demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n● our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n● our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;\n● the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n● the availability of capital.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous\ncoverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the payment that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in\nreimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain\nprofitability, or commercialize our drugs.\n40\nTable of Contents\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for\npharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance\nor interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our product candidate, may be.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval,\nas well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\nWe have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our\nbusiness’ size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and\ntherapeutic categories. We have also entered into several arrangements under which we have agreed to contingent dispositions of\nsubsidiaries, partner companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the value of such\ncompanies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe have entered into and consummated several partnerships and/or contingent sales of our assets and subsidiaries, including an equity\ninvestment and contingent acquisition agreement between Caelum and AstraZeneca (the acquisition component of which has\nconsummated) and a development funding and contingent asset purchase between Cyprium and Sentynl (the acquisition component of\nwhich has not yet consummated). Each of these arrangements has been time-consuming and has diverted management’s attention. As a\nresult of these consummated/contingent sales, as with other similar transactions that we may complete, we may experience a reduction in\nthe size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets, our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or\ntherapeutic categories or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories.\nIn addition, in connection with any transaction involving a (contingent or non-contingent) sale of one of our subsidiaries, partner\ncompanies or their assets, we may surrender our ability to realize long-term value from such asset or company, in the form of foregone\nproduct sales, royalties, milestone payments, sublicensing revenue or otherwise, in exchange for upfront and/or other payments. In the\nevent, for instance, that a product candidate underpinning any such asset or company is granted FDA approval for commercialization\nfollowing the execution of documentation governing the sale by us of such asset or company, the transferee of such asset or company may\nrealize tremendous value from commercializing such product, which we would have realized for ourselves had we not executed such sale\ntransaction and been able to achieve applicable approvals independently.\nShould we seek to enter into collaborations or divestitures with respect to other assets or companies, we may be unable to consummate\nsuch arrangements on satisfactory or commercially reasonable terms within our anticipated timelines. In addition, our ability to identify,\nenter into and/or consummate collaborations and/or divestitures may be limited by competition we face from other companies in pursuing\nsimilar transactions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.\nAny collaboration or divestiture we pursue, whether we are able to complete it or not, may be complex, time consuming and expensive,\nmay divert from management’s attention, may have a negative impact on our customer relationships, cause us to incur costs associated with\nmaintaining the business of the targeted collaboration or divestiture during the transaction process and also to incur costs of closing and\ndisposing the affected business or transferring the operations of the business to other facilities. In addition, if such transactions are not\ncompleted for any reason, the market price of our Common Stock may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a\nfailure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market of us generally and a decline in the market price of\nour Securities.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of the obligations, actions or inactions of certain of our\nsubsidiaries and partner companies. We have also entered into, and may again enter into, certain arrangements with our subsidiaries,\npartner companies and/or third parties pursuant to which a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may be issued.\nDepending on the terms of such arrangements, we may be contractually obligated to pay substantial amounts to third parties, or issue a\nsubstantially dilutive number of shares of our Common Stock, based on the actions or inactions of our subsidiaries and/or partner\ncompanies, regulatory agencies or other third parties.\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as indemnitor of potential losses or liabilities that may be experienced by one or more of our\nsubsidiaries, partner companies and/or their partners or investors. If we become obligated to pay all or a portion of such indemnification\namounts, our business and the market value of our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and/or debt securities may be materially adversely\naffected.\nAdditionally, we have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to act as guarantor in connection with equity or debt raises by our\npartner companies, pursuant to which we may become obligated either to pay what could be a significant amount of cash or issue what\ncould be a significant number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock if certain events occur or do not occur, which could lead to a\ndepletion of resources or dilution to our Common Stock, or both.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products and product candidates, and if we are\nunable to do so, or to integrate acquired products into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products,\nbusinesses or technologies. Future in-licenses or acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, but\nnot necessarily limited to:\n● exposure to unknown liabilities;\n● disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n● difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies in the\ncurrent economic environment;\n● incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n● higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n● increased amortization expenses;\n● difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n● impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and\nownership; and\n● inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and\nintegrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger biopharmaceutical companies and other\ncompetitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors may have access to greater\nfinancial resources than us and/or may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote\nresources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits\nof such efforts.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our officers and directors serve in similar roles at our partner companies, subsidiaries, related parties and/or other entities\nwith which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, which could result in conflicts of\ninterests relating to ongoing and future relationships and transactions with these parties.\nWe share directors and/or officers with certain of our subsidiaries, partner companies, related parties and other entities with which we\ntransact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, and such arrangements could create conflicts of interest in\nthe future, including with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities. While we believe that we have put in place policies and\nprocedures to identify and mitigate such conflicts, and that any existing agreements that may give rise to such conflicts and any such\npolicies or procedures were negotiated at arm’s length in conformity with fiduciary duties, such conflicts of interest, or the appearance of\nconflict of interest, may nonetheless arise. The existence and consequences of such potential or perceived conflicts could expose us to lost\nprofits, claims by our investors and creditors, and harm to our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nCertain of our executives, directors and principal stockholders, whose interests may be adverse to those of our other stockholders, can\ncontrol our direction and policies.\nCertain of our executive officers, directors and stockholders own nearly or more than 10% of our outstanding Common Stock and, together\nwith their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own a significant percentage of our capital stock. If these stockholders were to choose\nto act together, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval, including the election of directors and any sale, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This\nconcentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In\naddition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock by:\n● delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n● impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n● discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIf we acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain a controlling interest in, companies in the future, our financial condition,\noperating results and the value of our Securities may be adversely affected, thereby diluting stockholder value, disrupting our business\nand/or diminishing the value of our holdings in our partner companies.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain significant ownership stakes in other companies.\nAcquisitions of, joint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n● diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n● successfully negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us;\n● the impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;\n● the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed acquisitions or investment;\n● with respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; and\n● potential inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or invest in.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or other transaction opportunities, we might not achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of any such transaction, we might incur higher costs than anticipated, and management resources and attention might be diverted\nfrom other necessary or valuable activities.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our\nbusiness activities.\nAny terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including military conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the\nworldwide financial markets and economy. This includes Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the conflict between Israel and the\nHamas and Hezbollah extremist groups, recent attacks by armed groups on cargo ships in the Red Sea, and tensions across the Taiwan\nStrait. For instance, the United States or other countries may impose sanctions that restrict doing business in the effected countries and\nincreased military conflict may affect third-party vendors and cause delays.\nThis risk may be magnified in the case of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s invasion and the ensuing response by Ukraine\nmay disrupt our partner companies’ ability to conduct clinical trials in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia, and potentially other\nneighboring countries. Although the impact of Russia’s military action is highly unpredictable, certain clinical trial sites may be affected,\nincluding those of our partner company Checkpoint in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia. Those clinical trial sites may suspend or\nterminate trials, and patients could be forced to evacuate or choose to relocate, making them unavailable for initial or further participation\nin clinical trials. For instance, Checkpoint had to terminate their Phase 3 NSCLC trial in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of such\nconflicts. Alternative sites to fully and timely compensate for clinical trial activities in these areas may not be available, and we may need\nto find other countries to conduct these clinical trials. Clinical trial interruptions may delay our plans for clinical development and\napprovals for our product candidates, which could increase costs and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate.\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely predominantly on third parties to manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies, and we\nexpect to continue to rely heavily on such third parties and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our product candidates\nand products, if approved. Further, we rely solely on third parties to manufacture Journey’s commercialized products. Such dependence\non third-party suppliers could adversely impact our businesses.\nWe depend heavily on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material\nthat conforms to applicable specifications and FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval\nfor those products. Our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the\nFDA and comparable agencies and authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other\nauthorities determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMPs or comparable regulations, the relevant clinical trials\ncould be terminated or subjected to clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material and/or applicable\ncompliance, and commercial product could be unfit for sale, or if distributed, could be recalled from the market. Any delay, interruption or\nother issues that arise in the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, storage, or distribution of our products as a result of a failure of the\nfacilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, pass any regulatory agency inspection or\notherwise perform under our agreements with them could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products and\nproduct candidates. In addition, several of our currently commercialized products, sold through our partner company Journey, are produced\nby a single manufacturer, and, although we closely monitor inventory prophylactically, disruptions to such supply arrangements could\nadversely affect our ability to meet product demand and therefore diminish revenues.\nWe also rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the raw materials and equipment necessary to produce\nproduct candidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that\nare used to manufacture those products. We do not have direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials\nby our third-party manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials\nsince such agreements are entered into by our third-party manufacturers and their qualified suppliers. Any significant delay in the supply of\nraw material components\n44\nTable of Contents\nrelated to an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory\napproval.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to engage in our own commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, if they\nreceived marketing approval, and would likely continue to be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third\nparties to manufacture and supply clinical trial materials, as well as our planned dependence on third party manufacturers for any products\nthat may be approved, may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at\nall. In addition to the manufacturing and supply functions they provide, third-party manufacturers also play a key role in our efforts to\nobtain marketing approval for our product candidates, by interacting with, providing important information to, and hosting inspections by,\napplicable regulatory authorities. If a given contract development and manufacturing organization upon whom we rely in such a capacity is\nunwilling or unable to perform these activities on our behalf, the successful development and/or approval of the applicable product\ncandidate could be delayed significantly.\nIn addition, because of the sometimes-limited number of third parties who specialize in the development, manufacture and/or supply of our\nclinical and preclinical materials, we are often compelled to accept contractual terms that we deem less than desirable, including without\nlimitation as pertains representations and warranties, supply disruptions/failures, covenants and liability/indemnification. Especially as\npertains liability and indemnification provisions, because of the frequent disparities in negotiating leverage, we are often compelled to\nagree to low caps on counterparty liability and/or indemnification language that could result in outsized liability to us in situations where\nwe have zero or relatively little culpability.\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the development and manufacturing of products and product candidates.\nTo date, we have engaged primarily in intellectual property acquisitions, and evaluative and R&D activities; and we have not generated any\nrevenues from product sales (except through Journey). We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $694.9 million. We may need to rely on third parties for activities\ncritical to the product candidate development process, including but not necessarily limited to:\n● identifying and evaluating product candidates;\n● negotiating, drafting and entering into licensing and other arrangements with product development partners; and\n● continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and designing and executing clinical trials.\nWe have also not demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our\ndevelopment-stage product candidates, should any of them be approved for marketing. If we were to have any such product candidates\napproved, the successful commercialization of such products would be dependent on us performing or contracting with third parties for\nperformance, of a variety of critical functions, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● advising and participating in regulatory approval processes;\n● formulating and manufacturing products for clinical development programs and commercial sale; and\n● conducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development\nand clinical trials of, product candidates, both at the Fortress level and via our subsidiaries and partner companies. These operations\nprovide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to develop and commercialize potential product\ncandidates, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed-upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the\ntrials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory\napproval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe rely on third-party contract research organizations and site management organizations to conduct most of our preclinical studies and all\nof our clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, site\nmanagement organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our\npreclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. These CROs, investigators, and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the\nconduct of our trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators or other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical\ntrials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet\nexpected deadlines or fails to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be\nextended, delayed or terminated. If any of the clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may lose follow-up information on patients\nenrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those patients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition,\nprincipal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash and/or\nequity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual\nconflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site, or the FDA’s willingness to accept such data, may\nbe jeopardized.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve\nus of our responsibilities or potential liability. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and\nclinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our\npreclinical studies are conducted in accordance with GLPs as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCPs for\nconducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the\nrights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic\ninspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our clinical research organizations fail to comply with\napplicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities may refuse to accept such data, or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.\nWe cannot assure you that, upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical\ntrials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP in strict\nconformity to cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay\nthe regulatory approval process.\nWe also are required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored\ndatabase, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal\nsanctions.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party contract research organizations or site management organizations terminates, we may not\nbe able to enter into arrangements with alternative contract research organizations or site management organizations or to do so on\ncommercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional contract research organizations or site management organizations involves\nadditional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new contract research\norganization or site management organization commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to\nmeet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our contract research organizations or site\nmanagement organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future.\nWe rely on clinical and pre-clinical data and results obtained from and by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or\nunreliable.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we generally intend on developing product candidates with previously validated\nmechanisms of action and seek to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This\n46\nTable of Contents\nstrategy necessarily relies upon clinical and pre-clinical data and other results produced or obtained by third parties, which may ultimately\nprove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable, not acceptable by\nregulatory authorities or not applicable to our product candidates or acquired products, we could make inaccurate assumptions and\nconclusions about our current or future product candidates and our research and development efforts could be compromised.\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and/or incur substantial business risk with\nno assurance of financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance on strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our existing product candidates and we\nmay rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We may sell product offerings through strategic\npartnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on\nterms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\nIf we enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will, in part, depend on the performance of\nresearch collaborators. We may not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related\nto product candidates. Research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails\nto commit sufficient resources, the preclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated.\nAlso, collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being\ndeveloped in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other\nobligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or stop performance of those agreements.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the\nestablishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaboration proposals based upon their\nassessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property positions. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these\nrelationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue.\nTo the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product revenues that might follow are likely to be lower than if we\ndirectly marketed and sold products. Such collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar\nindications that may be available to collaborate on, and such collaborations could be more attractive than the one with us for any future\nproduct candidate.\nManagement of our relationships with collaborators will require:\n● significant time and effort from our management team;\n● coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and\n● effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.\nThe contractual provisions we may be forced to agree upon in services, manufacturing, supply and other agreements may be\ninordinately one-sided, vis-à-vis current or historical standard market terms (especially as pertains contractual liability and\nindemnification paradigms), and as a result we may be subject to liabilities that are not attributable to our own actions or the actions of\nour personnel.\nThere is a finite number of service providers who can perform the services or produce the materials or product candidates that we need, and\nwe therefore often have a limited number of options in choosing such service providers. The standard market terms in many of the\nagreements into which we customarily enter with such service providers are subject to evolution over time, often-times in favor of our\ncounterparties. Also, some such agreements are “adhesion contracts” under which our contractual counterparties refuse to entertain any\nmodifications to their template documentation. One area where service providers often have and exert leverage over us is the negotiation\nof liability language – specifically in broadly-scoped indemnification by us of service providers and/or the application of liability damages\n“caps” to certain of\n47\nTable of Contents\nsuch service providers’ indemnification obligations. In any circumstance where we’ve been compelled to agree to such language, it is\nconceivable that we will be liable to third parties for liabilities in excess of such caps that are attributable to the actions, forbearances and/or\nculpability of such service providers and their indemnitees (and not to those of us and our personnel).\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and\ncommercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and\nproducts may be impaired.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates and their formulations and uses. The\npatent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in\nobtaining patents or what the scope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily\nlimited to, the following:\n● patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive\nproduct candidates and their formulations and uses developed or produced by others;\n● our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners do, and many of which have made\nsignificant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere\nwith our abilities to make, use, and sell potential product candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending\npatent applications that we may have;\n● there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent\nprotection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy\nregarding worldwide health concerns; and\n● countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing\nforeign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be\nunenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance\nsubmission of prior art to the PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or\ninterference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial,\nand it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US\npatent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of,\nrender unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technologies or products and compete\ndirectly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party\npatent rights.\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade\ncompanies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often\nresponsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately\nprosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our abilities to develop and commercialize products may be adversely\naffected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly\nprotect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect\nproducts and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as well as affect the validity, enforceability,\nor scope of issued patents.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to\nprotect our and their trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third\nparties, and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still\ncome upon this same or similar information independently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and\nmay unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors’ proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able\nto identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is\ndifficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States\nare less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or\nindependently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate\nit, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be disclosed to or\nindependently developed by a competitor, our competitive positions would be harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable\npatent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our\nresearch and development output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given\nthe uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or\nprocess(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or\nprocess(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for one or\nmore product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third parties may be able to leverage our proprietary\ninformation and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our\nability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be required to consult\nwith or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these patents\nand applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual\nquestions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims\nallowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the US. The patent situation outside the US is even more\nuncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the US, and we may fail to seek or\nobtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the\nhuman body more than US law does. We might also become involved in derivation proceedings in the event that a third party\nmisappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or more inventions. The costs of\nthese proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party derived an\ninvention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope,\nvalidity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in\npart, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or\ninterpretation of the patent laws in the US and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent\nprotection. For example, the federal courts of the US have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter,\nsuch as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of utilizing same, which include their\ndetection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection.\nSuch subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now\nconsidered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the US. Accordingly, we cannot\npredict the breadth of claims that may be allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the\nenforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America\n49\nTable of Contents\nInvents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States\npatent law. These include changes to transition from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first inventor-to-file” system and to the way issued\npatents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a less burdensome, quicker and less expensive\nprocess for challenging issued patents. The PTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-\nSmith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first inventor-to-\nfile provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on\nthe operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding\nthe prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and financial condition.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent\ncompetitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent\nour owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed\nand approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval\n(depending on the nature of the specific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this\nexclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the\nproduct, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which\nwould materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an\nunfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture,\nmarket and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and\npending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may\nbe directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our licensors’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take\nmany years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product\ncandidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we\nor our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent\napplications in the US and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all.\nTherefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending\npatent applications that we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the\nevent that a third party has also filed a US patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the\npriority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine\npriority of invention in the US. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of\ninvention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity,\nenforceability and commercial value of our or any of our licensors’ patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and\nbiopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third\nparty’s intellectual property rights, we may have to, among other things:\n● obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n● abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial\nfunds, time and resources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;\n50\nTable of Contents\n● pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if a court decides that the product or\nproprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights;\n● pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or\n● defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial\ndiversion of financial and management resources.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming\nand unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our or our licensors’ patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file\ninfringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these\nparties to assert counterclaims against us alleging invalidity of our or our licensors’ patents or that we infringe their patents; or provoke\nthose parties to petition the PTO to institute inter partes review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of\nthe claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our\nlicensor’s is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using\nthe technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors’ patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any\nlitigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted\nnarrowly and could likewise put pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of\ndiscovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be\ncompromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe in-license from third parties a majority of the intellectual property needed to develop and commercialize products and product\ncandidates. As such, any dispute with the licensors or non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to\ndevelop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\nThe patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights underpinning the vast majority of our existing product candidates\nwere in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of such license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such\nagreements in the event of a material breach. The licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to\ncommercialization of any product, and our ability to make these payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These\nlicense agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our partners, on the one hand, and the\nrespective licensing partner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict,\ndispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and\ncommercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected.\nThe types of disputes that may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not\nnecessarily limited to:\n● the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;\n● the extent to which our technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such\nlicense agreements;\n● the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the\nlicensors’ right title and interest in the licensed technology and the licensors’ right to grant the licenses contemplated by such\nagreements;\n51\nTable of Contents\n● the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the\nrights and obligations associated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense\nunder such license agreement;\n● the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what\nactivities or achievements satisfy those diligence obligations;\n● whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;\n● the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;\n● the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual\nproperty that is the subject of such license agreements;\n● the calculation of royalty, milestone, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;\n● the extent to which rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;\n● whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to\nhave occurred, is or can be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;\n● disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent\nexpenses;\n● intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to\nlicensed intellectual property) by our and our partners’ licensors and us and our partners; and\n● the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain\nprovisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or\nmore agreements, which would make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing\npartners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our\nrights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the\nrelevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current\nlicensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected\nproduct candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n52\nTable of Contents\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval but do not achieve broad market\nacceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates,\nif approved, generate from sales will be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare\npayors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved by third-party payors, including\ngovernment payors, generally would also be necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products\nwould depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n● the timing of market introduction of such products as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n● acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n● the potential and perceived advantages of such products over alternative treatments;\n● the safety of such products in a broader patient group (i.e., based on actual use);\n● the availability, cost and benefits of treatment, in relation to alternative treatments;\n● the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n● changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for such products;\n● the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions,\nwarnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;\n● changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could\nreduce the marketing impact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n● relative convenience and ease of administration;\n● the prevalence and severity of side effects and adverse events;\n● the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n● unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and\npatients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our\nefforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources\nand may never be successful.\n53\nTable of Contents\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to\npromotional limitations.\nWe may not be able to obtain the desired labeling claims or scheduling classifications necessary or desirable for the promotion of our\nmarketed products (or our product candidates if approved). We may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the\nresults of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval while our products\nare on the market, the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority in another jurisdiction may withdraw marketing authorization or may\ncondition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if\nmanufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be impacted or withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical\ntrials, changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes\nmay limit the marketability of such products if approved.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one\nor more of our product candidates or a future product candidate we may license or acquire and may have to limit their\ncommercialization, if approved.\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale\nof any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if\nany product candidate or product we develop, license, or acquire allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during\nclinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing,\ndefects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate or product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of\nwarranties. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or\nselling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of\nmerit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n● decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop, license or acquire;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● impairment of our business reputation;\n● costs of related litigation;\n● substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n● loss of revenues;\n● reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n● the ability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates, if approved.\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage may not\nreimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming\nincreasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts\nto protect us against losses due to liability. When needed we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial\nproducts if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain\ncommercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been\nawarded in\n54\nTable of Contents\nclass action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought\nagainst us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect\nour business.\nAdditionally, we have entered into various agreements under which we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product\ncandidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these\nindemnifications.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be\nsubject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when\nand if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the authorized manufacturing facilities, processes and equipment, post-\napproval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will remain subject to ongoing regulatory\nrequirements governing drug or biological products, as well as review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These\nrequirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP\nrequirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements\nregarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and requirements regarding company presentations and interactions\nwith healthcare professionals. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the\nindicated uses for which the product may be marketed or subject to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-\nmarketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.\nWe also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of drug products. Later discovery of previously\nunknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result\nin actions such as:\n● restrictions on product manufacturing, distribution or use;\n● restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n● requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n● warning letters, untitled letters, or Form 483s;\n● recalls or other withdrawal of the products from the market;\n● refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n● fines;\n● suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n● refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n● product seizure or detentions;\n● injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n● adverse publicity.\nIf we or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in\nexisting regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may be subject to the\nactions listed above, including losing marketing approval for product candidates when\n55\nTable of Contents\nand if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties, which would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Securities\nto decline.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may\nadversely impact our business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until the relevant governmental authority has completed a\nrigorous and extensive regulatory review process, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product\ncandidates in the U.S. will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the\nPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other\nproduct names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the\nFDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product\ncandidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we could lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product\ncandidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would\nqualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to\nbuild a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our\nproduct candidates.\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly\nor indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and\nother healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational\nharm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and\nprescription of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and\ncustomers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and\nrelationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we\nmay be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state governments and by governments in foreign\njurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our\nability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n● the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering,\nreceiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the\nreferral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made\nunder federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n● federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose\ncriminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly\npresenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for\npayment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the\nfederal government; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal\nand civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to\nhealthcare matters;\n● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their\nrespective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare\nclearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive,\n56\nTable of Contents\nmaintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding\nthe privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n● the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for\nwhich payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to\nreport annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of\nvalue” made to “covered recipients,” which include physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists,\nchiropractors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-\nmidwives and teaching hospitals) and applicable manufacturers. Applicable group purchasing organizations also are required to\nreport annually to CMS the ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. The\nSUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act added to the definition of covered recipient practitioners including physician\nassistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives\neffective in 2022; and\n● analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or\nmarketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors,\nincluding private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical\nindustry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or\notherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to\nreport information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing\nexpenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many\nof which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve\nsubstantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or\nfuture statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are\nfound to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant\ncivil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in\ngovernment healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have\na material adverse effect on our businesses. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do\nbusiness, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or\nadministrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect\nour businesses.\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which could adversely affect our\nfinancial results, including without limitation the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in holding minority or non-control investment interests in a number\nof entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company\nAct”). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be\nexpected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.\n57\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Other Risks\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’\ncybersecurity.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our\nintellectual property and proprietary business information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we\nmaintain such confidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality, availability and integrity. Furthermore, we have\noutsourced elements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have access to our confidential information, which increases our\ndisclosure risk.\nWe are in the process of implementing our internal security and business continuity measures and developing our information technology\ninfrastructure. Our internal computer systems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to\ndamage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including\ncorporate firewalls, servers, third-party software, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of\nbreakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and\ntelecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees,\ncontractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the\ndeployment of harmful malware and other malicious code, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to\naffect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which could compromise our\nsystem infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our\ndata or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development\nprograms and our business operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2021, our\npartner company Journey was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that affected its accounts payable function and led to approximately\n$9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to fraudulent accounts. The details of the incident and its origin were investigated with the\nassistance of third-party cybersecurity experts working at the direction of legal counsel. The matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation and does not appear to have compromised any personally identifiable information or protected health information. The federal\ngovernment has been able to seize a significant amount of cryptocurrency assets associated with the breach. Once the cryptocurrency has\nbeen converted back into U.S. dollars, Journey expects to receive a notification letter to initiate the return of the cash. This process could\ntake as long as six months or more to complete. Fortress and Journey may incur additional expenses and losses as a result of this\ncybersecurity incident, including those related to investigation fees and remediation costs.\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in\nour regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for\nthe manufacture of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their\nsystems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a\nsecurity breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments,\nand cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the\nworld have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting\nto existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which could result\nin the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not\nbe able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change\nfrequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as\nexternal service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of,\npersonal information, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual\nproperty, proprietary business information, or other confidential or proprietary\n58\nTable of Contents\ninformation, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more effectively, compel us to comply with federal\nand/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to\nliability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up\nactions related to a security incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation\ncosts, in connection with these measures and otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur\nsignificant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity\nmeasures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel\nand protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. We may face increased costs and find it\nnecessary or appropriate to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party\nsystems where information important to our business operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such\ninsurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all\nclaims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and\ndivert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and\nconsultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may\nhave to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future\nevents of this nature from occurring.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop products and\nbusinesses.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific, and technical personnel and consultants,\nand on our ability to attract additional personnel as we continue to implement growth strategies and acquire and invest in companies with\nvaried businesses. During our operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of\nindividuals. However, as we continue to implement our growth strategy, the demands on our key employees will expand, and we will need\nto recruit additional qualified employees. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key\npersonnel, or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions, could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our partners. The loss or\nunavailability of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition\nand results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, and are not the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for any of our key\npersonnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that this\ncoverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may occur, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our ability\nto continue operations.\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not\nnecessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to\nwhich such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could\ninclude intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with cGMPs, comply with\nfederal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal\nprocedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In\nparticular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to\nprevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of\npricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\n59\nTable of Contents\nEmployee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials,\nwhich could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions we take\nto detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any\nsuch actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a\nsignificant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal\nsanctions.\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition\ntarget companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we\nhave in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or\nconsultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could\nsubject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based on\nsuch information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our\nemployees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives – especially if such disclosures are made to our competitor\ncompanies.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their\nformer employers or other clients.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates,\nmany of whom were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other\nbiopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether\nthese individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used, disclosed or misappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their\nformer employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in\ndefending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and/or the employees or consultants\nthat are implicated.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nThe stock prices of our securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, but not necessarily\nlimited to:\n● announcements we make regarding our current product candidates, acquisition of potential new product candidates and companies\nand/or in-licensing through multiple partners/affiliates;\n● sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n● issuance of debt or other securities;\n● our delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;\n● announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product\nintroductions;\n● developments concerning our licensors and/or product manufacturers;\n● litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n● conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n60\nTable of Contents\n● governmental regulation and legislation;\n● unstable regional political and economic conditions;\n● variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and\n● change in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological\ncompanies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated\nor disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market\nprices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSales or other issuances of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales or issuances may\noccur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of our Common Stock, inclusive of outstanding equity awards, are available for sale in the public\nmarket, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or an effective registration\nstatement. In addition, pursuant to our current shelf registration statements on Form S-3, from time to time we may issue and sell shares of\nour Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Any\nsale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or our Series A Preferred Stock could cause a drop in the trading price of our\nCommon Stock or Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\nWe will need to continue to expend capital on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of companies or\nproducts could place a strain on our management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire,\ntrain, and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with us and corporate culture. Integration and management issues\nassociated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s time and attention and distract our\nmanagement from other activities related to running our business.\nA catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits or cause us to lose key data, which could cause us to curtail\nor cease operations.\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health\nepidemics and pandemics, floods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability\nto operate our businesses could be seriously impaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be\nadequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase\nadditional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under\nour insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAny of the aforementioned circumstances may also impede our employees’ and consultants’ abilities to provide services in-person and/or in\na timely manner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and trigger effectiveness of “force\nmajeure” clauses under agreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we are obligated to achieve\ndevelopmental milestones on certain timeframes. Disputes with third parties over the applicability of such “force majeure” clauses, or the\nenforceability of developmental milestones and related extension mechanisms in light of such business interruptions, may arise and may\nbecome expensive and time-consuming.\n61\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be\nsubject to limitation.\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections\n382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a\ngreater than 50-percentage- point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year\nperiod), the corporation’s ability to use all of its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable\nincome or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of\nwhich changes are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset\npost-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur\ncosts that could harm our business.\nWe, and/or third parties on our behalf, may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could\nbe dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state\nand local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and\nregulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or\ncontamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property\nand casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or\nhazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or\npenalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our employees resulting\nfrom the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain\ninsurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or\nhazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nThese current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws\nand regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe have never paid and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future, except for the dividend we pay on our Series A\nPreferred Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our Common Stockholders.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, or made stock dividends, except for the dividend we pay on shares of our\nSeries A Preferred Stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses,\nand retain our stock positions. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash or stock\ndividends. Equally, each of our subsidiaries and partner companies is governed by its own board of directors with individual governance\nand decision-making regimes and mandates to oversee such entities in accordance with their respective fiduciary duties. As a result, we\nalone cannot determine the acts that could maximize value to you of such partner companies and subsidiaries in which we maintain\nownership positions, such as declaring cash or stock dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the\nsole source of gain for holders of our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\n62\nTable of Contents\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other\npersonnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could\nnegatively impact our business or the business of our partners.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and\nfunding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy\nchanges. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other\ngovernment agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and\nunpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary\ngovernment agencies, which would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. For example, over the last several years,\nincluding for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies,\nsuch as the FDA, have had to furlough nonessential FDA employees and stop routine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown\noccurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nIf the timing of FDA’s review and approval of new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners’ development process may be\ndelayed, which could result in delayed milestone revenues and materially harm our operations or business.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required\nto devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. Also, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial\nreporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our\noperating results, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our Securities.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), as well as\nrules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose various requirements on\npublic companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and appropriate\ncorporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of\ntime to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make\nsome activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us\nto obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially\nhigher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to\nserve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and\nprocedures. As a result, we are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow\nmanagement to report on the effectiveness of those controls, as required by Section 404 of SOX. These efforts to comply with Section 404\nand related regulations have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. While we\nanticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of Section 404, we cannot be\ncertain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test the effectiveness of our control systems in the future. If a material\nweakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require\nadditional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an\nadverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of\nour Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock or other Securities.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers and/or\ndelaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our\nstockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices.\n63\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nThese provisions include:\n● the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n● the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder\napproval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a\nrights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely\npreventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business\ncombination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has\nowned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested\nstockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the\nfuture for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you\nwould receive a premium for your ownership of our Securities through an acquisition.\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from the exchange.\nWe have previously failed to satisfy certain continued listing rules of the Nasdaq, including rules requiring that the minimum trading price\nof our Common Stock not close below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If we again are unable to meet the continued\nlisting requirements, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are unable\nto regain compliance with such rules. The delisting of our Securities from the Nasdaq may decrease the market liquidity and market price\nof our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely\naffect our business operations and financial performance. For example, the United States recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act,\nwhich provides for a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1%\nexcise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. In addition, it is uncertain if and\nto what extent various states will conform to newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net\ndeferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses could have a material\nimpact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n64\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have established certain processes for identifying, evaluating, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as a part of our\noverall technology management strategy. These processes are designed and reassessed on a periodic basis to help protect our technology\nassets and operations from internal and external security threats. We also engage with third parties, including consultants, to enhance our\nsecurity processes.\nWe have previously engaged and currently engage third parties to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity and technology management\nstrategy and continue to seek to implement new, and improve existing, processes regularly to adjust for changes in technology, internal or\nexternal threats, business strategy, and regulatory requirements. We, and our third parties, have deployed managed detection and response\nservices to monitor our technology infrastructure and information systems for possible threats. Our technology management strategy also\nincludes ongoing security training and education for employees regarding threats, including their role and responsibility in detecting and\nresponding to such threats.\nWe review the processes of our third party vendors and consider their ability to adhere to relevant industry practices and maintain adequate\ntechnology risk programs. In addition, we maintain cyber and cyber-related crime insurance coverage policies as part of our overall risk\nmanagement strategy, however, our policies may not be sufficient to cover against all potential future claims, if any.\nIn the last two fiscal years, we have not identified cybersecurity threats that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Although we proactively attempt to prevent all threats, we are unable to\neliminate all risk from cybersecurity threats or provide assurance that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. For\nmore information about these risks, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors “Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer\nsystem failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity”.\nCybersecurity Governance\nWhile our board of directors is responsible for oversight and risk management in general, our Audit Committee provides oversight of our\ntechnology management strategy to ensure that cybersecurity threats and risks are identified, evaluated, and managed. The Audit\nCommittee receives periodic updates from our management team regarding the overall state of our technology management strategy and\nany relevant risks from cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents.\nOur management team is responsible for assessing and managing the material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our management team\nmembers have expertise in information systems, compliance and corporate governance, which we believe are disciplines that are effective\nin the management of the Company’s cybersecurity risk. Our management team is informed of and monitors the prevention, detection, and\nmitigation of cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n65\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

In the ordinary course of business, however, the Company may be subject to both\ninsured and uninsured litigation. Suits and claims may be brought against the Company by customers, suppliers, partners and/or third\nparties (including tort claims for personal injury arising from clinical trials of the Company’s product candidates and property damage)\nalleging deficiencies in performance, breach of contract, negligence and other matters, and seeking resulting alleged damages.\nItem 4.

We have executed arrangements with some of the world’s foremost universities, research institutes and\npharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Cincinnati Children’s\nHospital Medical Center, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\n(“Mayo Clinic”), AstraZeneca plc and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.\nFollowing the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress\nleverages its business, scientific, regulatory, legal and financial expertise to help the partners achieve their goals. Partner and subsidiary\ncompanies then assess a broad range of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and\ndevelopment, including joint ventures, partnerships, out-licensings, sales transactions, and public and private financings. To date, four\npartner companies are publicly-traded, and two have consummated strategic partnerships with industry leaders AstraZeneca plc as\nsuccessor-in-interest to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“AstraZeneca”) and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”) a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.\nOur subsidiary and partner companies that are pursuing development and/or commercialization of biopharmaceutical products and product\ncandidates are Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI, “Avenue”), Baergic Bio, Inc. (“Baergic”, a subsidiary of Avenue), Cellvation, Inc.\n(“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT, “Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), Helocyte, Inc.\n(“Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM, “Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO, “Mustang”),\nOncogenuity, Inc. (“Oncogenuity”) and Urica Therapeutics, Inc. (“Urica”). Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc.

(“Maruho”), a Japanese company\nspecializing in dermatology and also Journey’s exclusive licensing partner that developed and is commercializing Qbrexza\n(Rapifort®) in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, Journey Medical received a $19 million upfront payment and granted\nMaruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Qbrexza® (Rapifort) for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in additional\nterritories in Asia (the “Territory”). Maruho is responsible for all development and commercialization costs for the program\nthroughout the Territory.\nLate Stage Product Candidates\nCosibelimab (anti-PD-L1 antibody)\n● Our partner company, Checkpoint, submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug administration\n(“FDA”) for cosibelimab, its investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced\ncutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”) who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in January 2023. In\nDecember 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) for the cosibelimab BLA. The CRL only cited findings that\narose during a multi-sponsor inspection of Checkpoint’s third-party contract manufacturing organization as approvability issues to\naddress in a resubmission. The CRL did not state any concerns about the clinical data package, safety, or labeling for the\napprovability of cosibelimab. We believe we can address the feedback in a resubmission to enable marketing approval in 2024.\n● In October 2023, Checkpoint announced the publication of results from the multicenter, multiregional, pivotal trial evaluating\ncosibelimab in patients with metastatic cSCC in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC), the peer-reviewed, online\njournal of the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer. The paper, entitled, “Efficacy and Safety of Cosibelimab, an Anti–PD-L1\nAntibody, in Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma” (doi:10.1136/jitc-2023-007637), describes safety and efficacy\nresults from 78 patients with metastatic cSCC enrolled at clinical sites in eight countries.\n● In July 2023, Checkpoint announced new, longer-term data for cosibelimab from its pivotal studies in locally advanced and\nmetastatic cSCC. These results demonstrate a deepening of response over time, resulting in substantially higher complete\nresponse rates than previously reported (55% objective response rate; 23% complete response rate in locally advanced cSCC and\n50% objective response rate; 13% complete response rate in metastatic cSCC). Furthermore, responses continue to remain durable\nover time.\n● In June 2023, Checkpoint announced that new pharmacokinetic modeling data on cosibelimab supporting the extension to an\nevery-three-week dosing regimen were presented at the Population Approach Group Europe 2023 annual meeting. The results\nsupport the comparability of cosibelimab 800 mg every-two-week and 1200 mg every-three-week dosing regimens.\n● A resubmission of the cosibelimab BLA is expected in 2024.\n● Cosibelimab was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Checkpoint.\nCUTX-101 (copper histidinate injection for Menkes disease)\n● In December 2023, our subsidiary, Cyprium completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 to Sentynl. Sentynl is obligated under the\nagreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CUTX-101, including the funding of the same.\nAdditionally, Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales milestones under the\nAgreement and royalties on net sales of CUTX-101 as follows: (i) 3% of annual net sales up to $75 million; (ii) 8.75% of annual\nnet sales between $75 million and $100 million; and (iii) 12.5% of annual net sales in excess of $100 million. Cyprium will retain\n100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at the New Drug Application (“ NDA”) approval for\nCUTX-101.\n69\nTable of Contents\n● The CUTX-101 rolling NDA submission is ongoing and is expected to be completed by Sentynl in 2024.\n● CUTX-101 was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Cyprium until the asset transfer in December 2023.\nDFD-29 (modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea)\n● In January 2024, Journey submitted an NDA to the FDA seeking approval for DFD-29 (minocycline hydrochloride modified\nrelease capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea in adults. If approved, DFD-29 has the\npotential to become the only oral, systemic therapy to address both inflammatory lesions and erythema (redness) from rosacea.\nJourney announced on March 18, 2024 that the FDA accepted the NDA and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act\n(“PDUFA”) goal date of November 4, 2024.\n● In October 2023, Journey announced data from a comparative bioavailability study of DFD-29 demonstrating systemic exposure\nof DFD-29 was significantly lower than that of Solodyn® (minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, 105mg) and that\nDFD-29 was safe and well tolerated throughout the study.\n● In July 2023, Journey announced positive topline data from the two DFD-29 Phase 3 clinical trials (MVOR-1 & MVOR-2) for the\ntreatment of rosacea and achievement of co-primary and all secondary endpoints and subjects completed the 16-week treatment\nwith no significant safety issues. DFD-29 demonstrated statistical superiority compared to Oracea® and placebo for Investigator’s\nGlobal Assessment (“IGA”) treatment success and the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies. In November\n2023, Journey also announced data for the secondary endpoint relating erythema assessment, in which DFD-29 showed\nsignificantly superior reduction in Clinicians Erythema Assessment (“CEA”) compared to placebo in both trials. In January 2024,\nJourney also announced results from the Phase 3 studies (MVOR-1 & MVOR-2) for DFD-29 on a secondary endpoint related to\nerythema (redness) assessment. DFD-29 showed significantly superior reduction in CEA compared to placebo in both MVOR-1\nand MVOR-2 clinical trials.\n● In June 2023, Journey announced positive topline data from the Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the impact of DFD-29 on the\nmicrobial flora of healthy adults and also evaluated the safety and tolerability of DFD-29. The study achieved all primary\nobjectives and no significant safety issues were noted during the study. The results indicate that DFD-29 can be safely used for up\nto 16 weeks with no significant risk of microbiota suppression or development of resistance.\nCAEL-101 (monoclonal antibody for AL amyloidosis)\n● CAEL-101 was sourced by Fortress in 2017 and was developed by Caelum until it was acquired by AstraZeneca on October 5,\n2021. AstraZeneca acquired Caelum for an upfront payment of approximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of\nwhich approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress, which was net of the ten percent escrow holdback amount and other\nmiscellaneous transaction expenses. The agreement also provides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders\ntotaling up to $350 million, payable upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. Fortress is eligible to receive\n42.4% of all proceeds of the transaction, including approximately $148 million to Fortress, with $31.8 million upon BLA\napproval.\n● There are two ongoing Phase 3 studies of CAEL-101 for AL amyloidosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04512235 and\nNCT04504825).\n● CAEL-101 (anselamimab) was sourced by Fortress and was developed by Caelum (founded by Fortress) until its acquisition by\nAstraZeneca in October 2021.\nIV Tramadol\n● In January 2024, Avenue reached a final agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 safety study protocol for IV tramadol and\nstatistical analysis approach, including the primary endpoint which will be a composite of elements indicative of opioid-induced\nrespiratory depression.\n● The final non-inferiority safety study is designed to assess the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression related to opioid\nstacking on IV tramadol compared to IV morphine. The study will randomize approximately 300 post-bunionectomy patients to\nIV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Patients will have access to IV\nhydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain.\n70\nTable of Contents\n● IV tramadol was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Avenue.\nTriplex (cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine)\n● In October 2023, we announced an exclusive option agreement with COH for patent rights to use Triplex, a cytomegalovirus\nvaccine, in combination with cytomegalovirus (“CMV”)-specific, Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) Chimeric\nAntigen Receptor (“CAR”) (collectively, CMV/HIV-CAR) T Cells for the treatment of adults living with HIV. Additionally, the\nCalifornia Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”) recently awarded an $11.3 million grant to COH to fund a Phase 1\nclinical trial involving the CMV/HIV-CAR T cells. In preclinical studies, administration of the dual-action CAR T cells followed\nby administration of a CMV vaccine successfully eradicated HIV, including from latent reservoirs.\n● In June 2023, we announced that the National Cancer Institute awarded a $3.2 million grant to COH for clinical studies of Triplex,\na CMV vaccine being developed by Helocyte and COH. This award will fund two planned multicenter, placebo-controlled,\nrandomized Phase 2 studies to evaluate the potential safety and immunological response of Triplex and its ability to enhance\nCMV-specific T cell immunity in stem cell donors to reduce the risk of CMV events in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell\ntransplant.\n● Triplex is also the subject of a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that could provide over $20\nmillion in non-dilutive funding for a 420-patient multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of Triplex for control\nof CMV in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The trial is expected to begin enrollment this year and we believe this data\nset could ultimately be used to support approval of Triplex in this setting.\n● Triplex is currently the subject of multiple ongoing clinical trials, including: a Phase 1/2 trial for CMV control in pediatric\nrecipients of HCT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03354728); a Phase 2 trial for reduction in viral load of Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) in adults co-infected with HIV and CMV (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05099965); and a\nPhase 1 trial of Triplex in combination with a bi-specific CMV/CD-19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell for the treatment of\nNon-Hodgkin Lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05432635). Triplex is also the subject of several planned studies,\nincluding: a Phase 2 evaluation for CMV control in recipients of liver transplant (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06075745); a\nPhase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of kidney transplant; and a Phase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of stem cell\ntransplant in which the stem cell donor is vaccinated with Triplex (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06059391).\n● The Phase 2 clinical trial of Triplex for adults co-infected with HIV and CMV is now fully enrolled with topline data anticipated\nin 2024. The study aims to show that vaccination with Triplex can potentially reduce the in intensity of highly active antiretroviral\ntherapy (“HAART”) which is used in up to 1.7 million treated HIV patients.\n● Triplex was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our subsidiary, Helocyte.\nEarly Stage Product Candidates\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T cell therapy)\n● In December 2023, Mustang announced initial data from its ongoing multicenter, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1/2 clinical\ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of MB-106 CAR-T cell therapy at the 2023 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”)\nAnnual Meeting. Initial data show that all patients responded clinically to treatment with MB-106 (n=9); 100% overall response\nrate for patients with follicular lymphoma (“FL”) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (“WM”). 100% of patients with FL (n=5)\nhad a complete response; 1 very good partial response and 2 partial responses were observed in WM patients (n=3); and the hairy\ncell leukemia variant (“HCL-v”) patient experienced stable disease, with prolonged, ongoing independence from blood\ntransfusions. Complete responses were observed in patients previously treated with CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. MB-106\nwas well tolerated in patients with indolent NHL, with no occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) above grade 1 and no\nimmune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS”) of any grade. Outpatient administration was allowed and\nfound to be feasible.\n● Mustang intends to treat the first patient in a non-randomized registrational multicenter trial in relapsed or refractory WM in the\nsecond half of 2024.\n● MB-106 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our partner company, Mustang.\n71\nTable of Contents\nDotinurad (urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout)\n● In the third quarter of 2023, Urica initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with gout and hyperuricemia in the U.S. to compare\nU.S. patients’ response to dotinurad with data generated in Japan, and to assess drug-drug interactions, if any, with allopurinol.\nUrica expects to announce data from this trial in the first half of 2024.\n● In June 2023, Urica announced data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers showed comparable pharmacokinetic,\npharmacodynamic and safety profile between U.S. and Japanese healthy subjects.\n● Dotinurad (URECE® tablet) was approved in Japan in 2020 as a once-daily oral therapy for gout and hyperuricemia. Dotinurad\nwas efficacious and well-tolerated in more than 500 Japanese patients treated for up to 58 weeks in Phase 3 clinical trials. The\nclinical program supporting approval included over 1,000 patients.\n● Dotinurad was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at our subsidiary, Urica.\nMB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR-T cell therapy)\n● The Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by COH for MB-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02208362) has completed the\ntreatment phase, and patients continue to be assessed for long-term safety.\n● In March 2024, Mustang announced that Phase 1 clinical data (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02208362) were published in\nNature Medicine. The data showed stable disease or better was achieved in 50% (n=29/58) of heavily pretreated patients for at\nleast two months, with two partial responses (PR), one complete response (CR), and a second CR after additional CAR-T cycles\nunder compassionate use. Patients with recurrent GBM treated in the final cohort with dual intratumoral/intraventricular delivery\nand an optimized manufacturing process had a median overall survival of 10.2 months compared to the expected survival rate of\nsix months in patients with recurrent GBM. The median overall survival for all patients was eight months.\n● Three additional MB-101 studies are ongoing or planned: 1) MB-101 with or without nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating\npatients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma (currently enrolling; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04003649) sponsored by\nCOH; 2) MB-101 in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma with a substantial component of leptomeningeal\ndisease (currently enrolling; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04661384) sponsored by COH; and 3) MB-101 in combination\nwith the herpes simplex virus type 1 oncolytic virus (MB-108) in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma or\nhigh-grade astrocytoma.\n● MB-101 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Mustang.\nMB-109 (MB-101 + MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus))\n● In October 2023, Mustang announced that the FDA has accepted its IND application to initiate a Phase 1 open label, multicenter\nclinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MB-109, a novel combination of MB-101 and MB-108 (herpes\nsimplex virus 1 oncolytic virus), for the treatment of IL13Rα2+ recurrent glioblastoma (“rGBM”) and high-grade astrocytoma.\n● MB-108 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Mustang.\nMB-110 (Ex Vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for RAG1 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency)\n● In July 2022, Mustang announced that the first patient successfully received LV-RAG1 ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy to treat\nrecombinase-activating gene-1 (“RAG1”) severe combined immunodeficiency (“RAG1-SCID”) in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical\ntrial taking place in Europe.\n● Leiden University Medical Centre is continuing to treat patients and expects to expand the trial to other centers in 2023.\n● LV-RAG1 is exclusively licensed by Mustang for the development of MB-110, a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for\nthe treatment of RAG1-SCID.\n● MB-110 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Mustang.\n72\nTable of Contents\nAJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer)\n● In January 2024, Avenue announced that all patients have been enrolled in Avenue’s Phase 1b/2a study, which is evaluating AJ201\nin the U.S. for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (“SBMA”), also known as Kennedy’s Disease. Topline data for\nthe Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 in SBMA are expected in the second quarter of 2024.\n● In March 2023, Avenue entered into an exclusive license agreement with AnnJi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for intellectual property\nrelated to AJ201. SBMA is a debilitating rare genetic neuromuscular disease primarily affecting men.\n● AJ201 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Avenue.\nBAER-101(GABA α2/3 positive allosteric modulator)\nA\n● In December 2023, Avenue presented the preclinical in vivo data evaluating BAER-101 using the GAERS model of absence\nepilepsy at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) 2023 Annual Meeting. The preclinical data demonstrated that BAER-101\nsignificantly suppressed seizures in a translational animal model of absence epilepsy. In an in vivo evaluation using the\nSynapCell’s Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (“GAERS”) model, BAER-101 fully suppressed seizure activity with\na minimal effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg, PO.\n● BAER-101 was sourced by Fortress and is currently in development at Baergic, a majority-owned subsidiary of Avenue.\nGeneral Corporate and Other\n● In October 2023, Fortress effected a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Stock\nSplit”) which brought the Company into compliance with Nasdaq’s $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued\nlisting.\n● In May 2023, Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences, Inc. (“uBriGene”),\npursuant to which Mustang agreed to sell its leasehold interests in its cell processing facility and associated assets relating to the\nmanufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies. On July 28, 2023, Mustang completed the sale of all of its assets relating\nto its operations primarily relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies. The aforementioned transaction\nis currently under review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), with the current review\nperiod set to conclude no later than March 28, 2024, although if CFIUS does not conclude on its review by March 28, 2024, the\nproceeding will transition to a second 45-day phase as CFIUS further investigates the transaction. There can be no assurance that\nCFIUS will ultimately provide clearance with respect to the transaction, or what mitigating measures may be required in order to\nobtain such clearance. Depending on the nature and severity of the national security risks identified, CFIUS may, among other\nmitigation measures, require suspension of the Transaction, require uBriGene to divest the Facility and/or other assets relating\nthereto, forfeit contracts that CFIUS deems to be sensitive, or require appointment of special compliance personnel or a proxy\nboard consisting of U.S. persons. If CFIUS determines to require mitigating measures with respect to the Transaction, then\nuBriGene must comply with such measures although the Closing Date has already occurred.\n● In April 2023, Aevitas entered into an asset purchase agreement for 4D Molecular Therapeutics (“4DMT”) to acquire Aevitas’\nproprietary rights to its short-form human complement factor H (“sCFH”) asset for the treatment of complement-mediated\ndiseases. Under the terms of the agreement, 4DMT will make cash payments to Aevitas totaling up to approximately $140 million\nin potential late-stage development, regulatory and sales milestones. A range of single-digit royalties on net sales are also payable.\nIn connection with the 4DMT APA, the Class A preferred shares of Aevitas held by the Company converted to Aevitas common\nshares, at which point the Company no longer maintained voting control of Aevitas.\n73\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include certain amounts that are based on\nmanagement’s best estimates and judgments. Our significant estimates include, but are not limited to, provisions for product returns,\ncoupons, rebates, allowances and distribution fees paid by Journey to certain wholesalers, inventory realization, useful lives assigned to\nlong-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets, fair value of stock options and warrants, stock-based compensation, common stock\nissued to acquire licenses, accrued expenses, and contingencies. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ\nfrom these estimates. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed\nbelow are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving\nmanagement’s judgments and estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part IV, Item 15,\nExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies\nare most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the\nrevenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, coupons, discounts, other sales allowances and sales returns.\nThese deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the\nimpact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results\nor updated expectations have not been material to our overall business. Coupons, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year\nindividual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences, or judgments are not indicative or accurate\nestimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary differs by program,\nproduct, type of customer and geographic location.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company follows accounting guidance on fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Under the accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a\nmarket-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a\nliability.\nThe accounting guidance requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in\nthe marketplace.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values\nare determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\n74\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its\nentirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\nCertain of our financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate their\nfair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, such as accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIssuance of Debt and Equity\nFortress and its partner companies and subsidiaries issue complex financial instruments which include equity and/or debt features. We\nanalyze each instrument under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging and, ASC 470, Debt, in\norder to establish whether such instruments include any embedded derivatives.\nWe accounted for the Oaktree Note with detachable warrants in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. We assessed the classification of the\ncommon stock purchase warrants issued in connection with such transaction and determined that such instruments met the criteria for\nequity classification. The note proceeds were allocated between the Oaktree Note and the warrants on a relative fair value basis.\nWe recorded the related issue costs and value ascribed to the warrants as a debt discount of the Oaktree Note. The discount is being\namortized utilizing the effective interest method over the term of the Oaktree Note, which is approximately 16.13% at December 31, 2023.\nAccrued Research and Development Expense\nWe record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing development within accrued expenses which are\nsignificant components of research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is\nconducted by third-party service providers. We accrue the costs incurred under agreements with these third parties based on estimates of\nactual work completed in accordance with the respective agreements. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with internal\npersonnel and external service providers as to the progress, or stage of completion or actual timeline (start-date and end-date) of the\nservices and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the\nperformance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.\nIf the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust accrued expenses or prepaid\nexpenses accordingly, which impact research and development expenses. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially\ndifferent from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and\ntiming of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part IV, Item\n15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n75\nTable of Contents\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million\nor (ii) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million\nduring the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our\nshares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently\ncompleted fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company,\nwe may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K , have\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and smaller reporting companies are permitted to delay adoption of\ncertain recent accounting pronouncements discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in “Part IV, Item 15,\nExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries\nfor which it has voting control but does not own 100% of the outstanding equity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the\nCompany owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but retains voting control, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling\ninterests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its\nconsolidated balance sheets.

Collaboration revenue related to\nCyprium’s agreement with Sentynl increased $3.3 million due to the receipt of $4.5 million associated with Sentynl’s assumption of control\nof the CUTX-101 development program, as well as recognition of $0.7 million of deferred revenue.\nCost of goods sold\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nCost of goods sold – product revenue $ 26,660 $ 30,775 $ (4,115) (13)%\nWe had $26.7 million and $30.8 million of costs of goods sold in connection with the sale of JMC branded and generic products for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cost of goods sold decreased by $4.1 million, or 13% year-over-year, with the\ndecrease mainly due to lower-than-prior-year product royalties driven by lower sales of products from period-to-period, and a permanent\ncontractual decrease in the Qbrexza royalty percentage from the prior-year period.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related\nexpenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for licenses and milestones, costs related to in-licensed products and\ntechnology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical\ntrials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and patents,\nlaboratory costs and other supplies.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, research and development expenses were approximately $101.7 million and $134.2\nmillion, respectively.

Journey’s decreased research and development costs are due to lower clinical trial expenses to develop DFD-29,\nas the project winds down and eventually concludes. Potential FDA approval for DFD-29 is expected in the second half of 2024.\nCheckpoint’s decrease in research and development spending of $7.8 million is attributable to a $6.6 million decrease in manufacturing\ncosts and a $5.6 million decrease in clinical costs, offset by an increase in regulatory costs of $0.8 million, due to the PDUFA fee to the\nFDA for the BLA filing for cosibelimab, and $2.3 million in license fees due upon the FDA filing acceptance of the BLA. Avenue’s\nincrease in research and development in 2023 is primarily attributable to clinical costs related to the Phase 1b/2a of AJ201 for the treatment\nof SBMA, also known as Kennedy’s disease. The decrease in “Other” is attributable to a decrease of $1.3 million in costs incurred by\nCyprium for the CUTX-101 development program as it was assumed by Sentynl, a decrease of $0.4 million for Aevitas development since\nthe deconsolidation of that subsidiary due to the transaction with 4DMT, offset by an increase of $1.7 million of costs incurred by Urica for\nthe dotinurad clinical program.\nNoncash, stock-based compensation expense included in research and development for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was\n$3.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nStock-based compensation - research & development\nFortress $ 1,624 $ 1,592 $ 32 2%\nPartner Companies:\nAvenue 199 297 (98) (33)%\nCheckpoint 1,169 888 281 32%\nJMC 112 73 39 54%\nMustang 133 1,583 (1,450) (92)%\nOther1 0 10 (10) (100)%\nTotal stock-based compensation expense - research and development $ 3,237 4,443 $ (1,206) (27)%\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Baergic (until November 2022), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte,\nOncogenuity and Urica.\nWe expect research and development costs to remain flat or decrease modestly in 2024.\n79\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development – licenses acquired\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nResearch and development – licenses acquired $ 4,324 $ 677 $ 3,647 539%\nThe increase in research and development – licenses acquired of $3.6 million in 2023 is due primarily to $4.2 million paid for Avenue’s\nlicense from AnnJi for AJ201.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel related costs, costs required to support the marketing and sales\nof our commercialized products, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses\nnot otherwise included in research and development expenses.

JMC’s cost reductions were offset slightly by a loss on impairment of intangible assets of $3.1 million\nrelated to the impairment of Ximino as a result of lower net product revenues and gross profit levels. JMC discontinued Ximino in\nSeptember 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs at Fortress and Mustang is attributable to cost reduction efforts\nand optimization relating to personnel, consulting, and infrastructure.\nStock based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 was $13.8 million and $18.5 million, respectively.\n80\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nStock-based compensation - Selling, general and administrative\nFortress $ 8,320 $ 11,060 $ (2,740) (25)%\nPartner Companies:\nAvenue 707 352 355 101%\nCheckpoint 1,728 2,036 (308) (15)%\nJMC 2,494 4,352 (1,858) (42)%\nMustang 435 700 (265) (38)%\nOther1 108 44 64 145%\nTotal stock-based compensation expense - selling, general and administrative $ 13,792 18,544 $ (4,752) (26)%\nNote 1: Includes the following subsidiaries: Aevitas (until April 2023), Baergic (until November 2022), Cellvation, Cyprium, Helocyte,\nOncogenuity and Urica.\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expenses to remain flat or decrease modestly in 2024.\nOther expense\nDecember 31, Change\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income $ 3,003 $ 1,398 $ 1,605 115%\nInterest expense and financing fee (15,315) (13,642) (1,673) 12%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 4,424 1,129 3,295 292%\nOther income (expense) (3,403) 1,215 (4,618) (380)%\nTotal other expense $ (11,291) (9,900) $ (1,391) 14%\nTotal other income (expense) increased $1.4 million, or (14)%, from expense of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to\nexpense of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in change in fair value of warrant liabilities\nassociated with warrants related to financings at Avenue and Checkpoint of $9.9 million, and an increase in interest income of $1.6 million,\noffset by an increase of $1.7 million in interest expense and financing fees due to costs associated with debt payoff at Journey and Mustang,\nand an increase of $4.6 million in other expense in the year ended December 31, 2023 due primarily to $4.1 million associated with the\ndeconsolidation and dissolution of partner companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAt December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $694.9 million primarily as a result of research and development expenses,\npurchases of in-process research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n81\nTable of Contents\nWe will require additional financing to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for our existing and\nnew product candidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for our\npotential products, and sales and marketing capabilities.

The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in net loss of $59.8 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and the net decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of\n$11.9 million offset by the increase in loss from deconsolidation and dissolution of subsidiaries of $4.1 million and a $3.1 million asset\nimpairment loss.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $22.9 million decreased $20.8 million to net cash used by\ninvesting activities of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change is primarily due to Journey’s purchase of the VYNE\nTherapeutics, Inc. (“VYNE”) product licenses of $20.0 million and Mustang’s property and equipment purchases of $2.7 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, offset by $6 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment recorded by Mustang for the\nuBriGene transaction.\n84\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $32.7 million of net cash\nprovided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $42.6 million. The decrease is primarily due to the\nrepayment of partner company debt of $81.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock in public offerings of\n$22.1 million, and proceeds from new partner company debt of $14.5 million.\nComponents of cash flows from publicly-traded partner companies are:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\n($ in thousands) Fortress1 Avenue Checkpoint JMC Mustang Total\nStatement of cash flows data:\nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (26,947) $ (9,451) $ (47,590) $ 5,240 $ (49,477) $ (128,225)\nInvesting activities 11 (3,000) — (5,000) 5,886 (2,103)\nFinancing activities 15,648 7,526 40,450 (4,804) (26,081) 32,739\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted\ncash $ (11,288) $ (4,925) $ (7,140) $ (4,564) $ (69,672) $ (97,589)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands) Fortress1 Avenue Checkpoint JMC Mustang Total\nStatement of cash flows data:\nTotal cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (35,651) $ (7,596) $ (57,554) $ (13,534) $ (65,066) $ (179,401)\nInvesting activities 24 — — (20,000) (2,952) (22,928)\nFinancing activities (621) 10,541 14,887 16,456 34,056 75,319\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash $ (36,248) $ 2,945 $ (42,667) $ (17,078) $ (33,962) $ (127,010)\nNote 1: Includes Fortress and non-public subsidiaries.\nContractual Obligations\nOur short-term and long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 include:\n● Contractual payments related to our long-term debt (see Note 9, Debt and Interest, to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in “Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K);\n● obligations under our leases (see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n● obligations under license agreements (see Note 7, License Agreements to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nUnder the license agreements, we are required to make milestone payments upon successful completion and achievement of certain\ndevelopment, regulatory and commercial milestones, the payment obligations of which are contingent upon future events, such as our\nachievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and the amount, timing, and likelihood of such payments are\nnot known.

Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed only to provide reasonable\nassurance that they will meet their objectives. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2023, of the design\nand operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on\nthis evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls\nand procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined\nin Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the\nsupervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and\nother personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nour assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our\nmanagement and directors; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human\ndiligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over\nfinancial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk\nthat material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these\ninherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to\nreduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n86\nTable of Contents\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”)\nin Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the results of this assessment, management (including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer) has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended) adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933).\nItem 9C.

In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As\npart of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such\nopinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nEvaluation of accrued coupon liability\nAs discussed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company accrues for coupons on products for certain qualified\ncommercially-insured parties. At December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $9,987 thousand in accrued coupon and rebates, which\nincluded the accrued coupon liabilities. The Company estimates the amount of its expected coupon redemptions for product that is still in\nthe distribution channel and records the estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The\nCompany’s accrued coupon liability is primary based on historical company coupon redemption costs, cost per coupon claim, and estimates\nof product remaining in the distribution channel.\nWe identified the evaluation of the accrued coupon liability as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of auditor judgment required\nin the evaluation of certain assumptions used in the determination of the accrued coupon liability, including the estimation of product in the\ndistribution channel, coupon redemption costs, and the cost per coupon claims.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal\ncontrols over the Company’s accrued coupon process, including a control over the assumptions. We performed a risk assessment procedure\nto assess the sensitivity of changes in the estimate of distribution channel inventory on the accrued coupon liability. We tested the sales data\nand coupon redemption data used by management to calculate coupon redemption costs and cost of coupon claims by comparing the data\nto historical information. We developed an expectation of the accrued coupon liability based on an independent estimate of the product in\nthe distribution channel and we compared our expectation to the Company’s accrued coupon liability.\nAccounting for and fair value of the warrant inducement transaction\nAs discussed in Notes 6 and 13 to the financial statements, in October 2023, Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Checkpoint), a consolidated\nsubsidiary of the Company, entered into an inducement offer letter agreement with a holder of certain existing warrants. As part of the\ninducement, Checkpoint issued new unregistered Series A and Series B warrants. The Series A and B warrants are exercisable immediately\nupon issuance with an exercise price of $1.51 per share. The total gross proceeds from the inducement were approximately $11.1 million\nwith net proceeds of approximately $10.0 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs. Prior to the inducement, some\nof the existing warrants were liability classified and accounted for at fair value. At the date of the inducement, the Company revalued the\nexisting liability classified warrants which resulted in a loss on common stock warrant liabilities. The other existing warrants, which were\nequity classified, were revalued to calculate the difference in fair value as a result of the change in exercise price, which was recorded as a\ndeemed dividend. The Company also calculated the fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants and allocated that fair value to the\nexisting warrants on a weighted basis. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to determine the estimated fair value of the warrants.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s accounting for the inducement transaction and the determination of the fair value of the\nwarrants as a critical audit matter. Specifically, challenging and complex auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were\nrequired in evaluating 1) the application of the relevant accounting guidance for equity and liability classified warrants and 2) the estimated\nfair value of the warrants due to the degree of subjectivity associated with the volatility assumption.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We inspected the Company’s accounting\nanalysis for the transaction. We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in inspecting the underlying\nagreements to understand the relevant terms and conditions of the transaction and evaluating whether the Company’s accounting for the\ntransaction is in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in:\n● developing an independent expectation of the volatility assumption based on consideration of implied share price volatility\ninformation\n● developing an independent range of the fair value of the warrant liability for the December 2022 warrants, the fair value of the\nFebruary 2023 equity classified warrants, and the fair value of both the Series A and Series B\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nwarrants as of the inducement date using publicly available market data and the independently developed volatility assumption\n● comparing the independently developed ranges of the fair value to the respective fair value of the warrant liability and the equity\nclassified awards determined by the Company.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nShort Hills, New Jersey\nMarch 28, 2024\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nFORTRESS BIOTECH, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to\nenhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holding and dividend and royalty revenue streams. Fortress\nworks in concert with its extensive network of key opinion leaders to identify and evaluate promising products and product candidates for\npotential acquisition. The Company has executed such arrangements in partnership with some of the world’s foremost universities, research\ninstitutes and pharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson\nCancer Center, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Nationwide Children’s Hospital,\nCincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, Mayo Foundation for Medical\nEducation and Research (“Mayo Clinic”), AstraZeneca plc and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.\nFollowing the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress\nleverages its business, scientific, regulatory, legal and finance expertise to help the partners achieve their goals. Partner and subsidiary\ncompanies then assess a broad range of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and\ndevelopment, including joint ventures, partnerships, out-licensings, sales transactions, and public and private financings. To date, four\npartner companies are publicly-traded, and three have consummated strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including AstraZeneca plc\nas successor-in-interest to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“AstraZeneca”) and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”).\nOur subsidiaries and partner companies that are pursuing development and/or commercialization of biopharmaceutical products and\nproduct candidates are: Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI, “Avenue”), Baergic Bio, Inc. (“Baergic”, a subsidiary of Avenue),\nCellvation, Inc. (“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT, “Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”),\nHelocyte, Inc. (“Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM, “Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO,\n“Mustang”), Oncogenuity, Inc. (“Oncogenuity”) and Urica Therapeutics, Inc. (“Urica”). Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aevitas”) was a\nconsolidated subsidiary company until the sale of its primary asset to 4D Molecular Therapeutics in April 2023.\nAs used throughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually, to one or more of its subsidiaries and/or\npartner companies, or to all such entities as a group, as dictated by context. Generally, “subsidiary” refers to a private Fortress subsidiary,\n“partner company” refers to a public Fortress subsidiary, and “partner” refers to an entity with whom one of the foregoing parties has a\nsignificant business relationship, such as an exclusive license or an ongoing product-related payment obligation. The context in which any\nsuch term is used throughout this document, however, may dictate a different construal from the foregoing.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn October 9, 2023, Fortress filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to\neffect the 1-for-15 Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s shares of Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split\nwas approved on August 10, 2023, by the Company’s Board of Directors and by the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting held on\nOctober 9, 2023. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 15 shares of the Company’s pre-reverse split Common Stock was combined\nand reclassified as one share of Common Stock. The proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected\nby the Reverse Stock Split, other than as the result of payment for fractional shares. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the\nReverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of Common Stock received a cash payment in lieu\nthereof. In addition, there was no change to the authorized capital of the Company as a result of the reverse Stock Split and the number of\nauthorized shares of common stock remained 200,000,000.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nAll share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.\nProportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all\nstock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding at October 10, 2023, which resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of\nshares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock and warrants,\nand, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, the Company’s operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities, from the sale of\nsubsidiaries/partner companies, and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options. The Company has incurred losses from\noperations and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the next\nseveral years as it continues to fully develop and prepare regulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for its existing and new product\ncandidates. The parent Company’s current cash and cash equivalents of $40.6 million are sufficient to fund the parent entity and private\nsubsidiary operations for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company will need to raise additional funding through strategic\nrelationships, public or private equity or debt financings, sale of a partner companies, grants or other arrangements to develop and prepare\nregulatory filings and obtain regulatory approvals for the existing and new product candidates, fund operating losses, and, if deemed\nappropriate, establish or secure through third parties manufacturing for the potential products, sales and marketing capabilities. If such\nfunding is not available or not available on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company’s current development plans, and plans for\nexpansion of its general and administrative infrastructure may be curtailed. Fortress also has the ability, subject to limitations imposed by\nRule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 and other applicable laws and regulations, to raise money from the sale of common stock of the\npublic companies in which it has ownership positions.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements include the results of the Company’s subsidiaries for which it has voting control but does not own 100% of the outstanding\nequity of the subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company owns less than 100% of the subsidiary, but retains voting control,\nthe Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-\ncontrolling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense\nitems are eliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based\non ownership interests as calculated quarterly for each subsidiary.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s significant estimates\ninclude, but are not limited to, provisions for product returns, coupons, rebates, chargebacks, discounts, allowances and distribution fees\npaid by Journey to certain wholesalers, inventory realization, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets and\namortizable intangible assets, fair value of stock options and warrants, stock-based compensation, common stock issued to acquire licenses,\naccrued expenses and contingencies. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records and recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\nrevenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation – the\ndelivery of product. The Company’s performance obligation to deliver products is satisfied at the point in time that the goods are received\nby the customer, which is when the customer obtains title to and has the risks and rewards of ownership of the products. The transaction\nprice is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a\ncustomer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.\nMany of the Company’s products sold are subject to a variety of deductions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable\nconsideration, including coupons, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, prompt pay discounts, specialty pharmacy discounts, managed care\nrebates, product returns, government rebates and other deductions customary to the pharmaceutical industry. Accruals for these provisions\nare presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to gross sales in determining net sales and as a contra asset within\naccounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can\nresult from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The\nfollowing section briefly describes the nature of the Company’s provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are\nestimated:\nCoupons — The Company offers coupons on products for qualified commercially-insured parties with prescription drug co-payments. Such\nproduct sales flow through both traditional wholesaler and specialty pharmacy channels. Coupons are processed and redeemed at the time\nof prescription fulfilment by the pharmacy. The expected accrual reserve requires us to estimate the distribution channel inventory at period\nend, the expected redemption rates, and the cost per coupon claim that the Company expects to receive. The estimate of product remaining\nin the distribution channel is comprised of estimated inventory at the wholesaler as well as an estimate of inventory at the specialty\npharmacies, which the Company estimates based upon historical ordering patterns. The estimated redemption rate is based on historical\nredemptions as a percentage of units sold. The cost per coupon is based on the coupon rate.\nChargebacks and Government Chargebacks — The Company sells a portion of its products indirectly through wholesaler distributors to\ncontracted indirect customers and qualified government healthcare providers. The Company enters into specific agreements with or\nprovides discounts to these indirect customers and entities to establish pricing for the Company’s products, and in-turn, the indirect\ncustomers and entities independently purchase these products. The Company’s provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through\nlevels by the Company’s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels as well as historical\nchargeback rates. The Company continually monitors its reserve for chargebacks and adjusts the reserve accordingly when expected\nchargebacks differ from actual experience.\nWholesaler fees — The Company provides allowances to its wholesale customers for sales order management, data, and distribution\nservices. The Company also pays administrative and other fees to certain wholesale customers consistent with pharmaceutical industry\npractices. The Company records a provision for these fees based on contracted rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include\ncontract sales volumes and average contract pricing. The Company regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts\nthe provision accordingly.\nSpecialty Pharmacy Discounts — The Company has in place contractual arrangements with specialty pharmacies and provides for\ncontractually agreed upon discounts. These discounts are recorded at the time of sale based on the customer’s contracted rate and recorded\nas a reduction of revenue.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nManaged Care Rebates — The Company is subject to rebates in connection with its agreements with certain contracted commercial payers.\nThe Company estimates its managed care rebates based on the Company’s estimated payer mix and the applicable contractual rebate rate.\nThe Company’s accrual for managed care rebates is based on an estimate of future claims that the Company expects to receive, which\nconsiders an estimate for inventory in the distribution channel. The accrual is recognized at the time of sale, resulting in a reduction of\ngross product revenue.\nProduct Returns — Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers customers a right to return any unused product. The customer’s\nright of return commences six months prior to product expiration date and ends one year after product expiration date. Products returned for\nexpiration are reimbursed at current wholesale acquisition cost or indirect contract price. The Company estimates the amount of its product\nsales that may be returned by the Company’s customers and accrues this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product\nrevenue is recognized. The Company estimates products returns as a percentage of sales to its customers. The rate is estimated by using\nhistorical sales information, including its visibility and estimates into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nCollaboration Revenue\nThe Company’s collaboration revenue includes service revenue, license fees and future contingent milestone-based payments.\nCollaboration revenue is recognized for contracted R&D services performed for its customers over time. The Company measures its\nprogress using an input method based on the effort expended or costs incurred toward the satisfaction of the Company’s performance\nobligation. The Company estimates the amount of effort to be expended, including the time it will take to complete the activities, or the\ncosts that may be incurred in a given period, relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results\nin a percentage that is multiplied by the transaction price to determine the amount of revenue the Company recognizes each period. This\napproach requires the use of estimates and judgement. If the Company’s estimates or judgements change over the course of the\ncollaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue that is recognized in the current and future periods.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company follows accounting guidance on fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Under the accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a\nmarket-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a\nliability.\nThe accounting guidance requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in\nthe marketplace.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values\nare determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement\nin its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\nCertain of the Company’s financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that\napproximate their fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, such as accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company operates in two operating and reportable segments, Dermatology Product Sales and Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology\nProduct Development. The Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on operating profit or loss. There is no inter-\nsegment allocation of interest expense and income taxes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and\ncash equivalents at December 31, 2023 and 2022, consisted of cash and certificates of deposit in institutions in the United States. The\nCompany maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high-quality financial institutions and, consequently, the Company believes\nthat such funds are currently adequately protected against credit risk. At times, portions of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents may\nbe uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limits, though the Company customarily\ninvests a significant portion of its cash in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) accounts to maximize FDIC\ninsurance coverage across its holdings. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not experienced losses on these accounts, and\nmanagement believes the Company is not exposed to significant risk on such accounts. The Company’s cash equivalents and investments\nmay comprise money market funds that are invested in U.S. Treasury obligations, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury obligations and\ngovernment agency securities. The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts\nor other foreign hedging arrangements.\nProperty and Equipment\nComputer equipment, furniture and fixtures and machinery and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful life of each asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or\nthe term of the respective leases.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets consist of intangible assets acquired by Journey. Intangible assets are reported at cost, less\naccumulated amortization. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which represents the estimated\nlife of the product. Amortization is calculated primarily using the straight-line method.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into certain licenses and asset purchase agreements. Potential milestone\npayments for achieving sales targets or regulatory development milestones are recorded when it is probable of achievement. Upon a\nmilestone payment being achieved, the milestone payment will be capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life for approved\nproducts and expensed for milestones prior to FDA approval. Royalty payments are recorded as cost of goods sold as sales are recognized.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment at least annually or whenever\nevents or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable (a “triggering\nevent”). Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of\nthe long-lived asset in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned\nchanges in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company\ncompares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its\ncarrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of\nan asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset\nover its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Journey recorded an intangible\nasset impairment charge of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. This non-cash charge was recorded to selling, general\nand administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company did not record any impairment loss on long-lived\nassets for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company records cash held in trust or pledged to secure certain debt obligations as restricted cash. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had $2.4 million of restricted cash representing pledges to secure letters of credit in connection with certain office leases and an\nundertaking posted by Cyprium to secure potential damages in an injunctive proceeding. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $2.7\nmillion of restricted cash representing pledges to secure letters of credit in connection with certain office leases.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from the consolidated balance sheets to the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows as of the dates presented:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 80,927 $ 178,266\nRestricted cash 2,438 2,688\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 83,365 $ 180,954\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods supporting Journey’s sales of dermatology\nproducts. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The\nCompany periodically reviews the composition of inventory in order to identify excess, obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise non-saleable\nitems taking into account anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand, and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand. If non-\nsaleable items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory, the Company records a write-down to net realizable value in\nthe period that the decline in value is first recognized. The Company’s inventory reserves were $0.3 million and $0.4 million at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nThe Company’s accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers to Journey related to dermatological product sales and have\nstandard payment terms. For certain customers, the accounts receivable for the customer are net of prompt payment or specialty pharmacy\ndiscounts. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and\nrespond to changes in their credit profile. The Company reserves against accounts receivable for estimated losses that may arise from a\ncustomer’s inability to pay, and any amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the reserve when it is probable that the\nreceivable will not be collected. The Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses. The allowance for doubtful\naccounts was $0.5 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research\nand development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the\npayment is made. Upfront and milestone payments due to third parties that perform research and development services on the Company’s\nbehalf will be expensed as services are rendered or when the milestone is achieved.\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related\nexpenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and\ntechnology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical\ntrials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, and costs associated with regulatory filings, laboratory\ncosts and other supplies.\nIn accordance with ASC 730-10-25-1, Research and Development, costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged to research\nand development expense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial feasibility and has no alternative future use. Such licenses\npurchased by the Company require substantial completion of research and development, regulatory and marketing approval efforts in order\nto reach commercial feasibility and has no alternative future use. Accordingly, the total purchase price for the licenses acquired is reflected\nin research and development – licenses acquired in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nContingencies\nThe Company records accruals for contingencies and legal proceedings expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency when\nit is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIf a loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent liability,\ntogether with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are\nclassified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability,\ncalculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing\nrate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease\nterm. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense\nover the lease term. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset results in front-loaded\nexpense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred.\nIn calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components. The Company\ncontinues to account for leases in the prior period consolidated financial statements under ASC Topic 840, Leases.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the\nestimated grant-date fair value of the awards and forfeitures, which are recorded upon occurrence. The Company estimates the fair value of\nstock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards\nrepresent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and\nfor the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation\nallowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a\nrecognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to\nbe taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination\nby taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period,\ndisclosure and transition. Based on the Company’s evaluation, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company has\nrecorded a liability related to an uncertain tax position of $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The 2019 through 2021 tax years are\nthe only periods subject to examination upon filing of appropriate tax returns. The Company believes that its income tax positions and\ndeductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial\nposition.\nThe Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such expense as a component of income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $0.1 million\nand approximately $32,000, respectively. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant\npayments, accruals or material deviations from its position.\nNet Loss Per Common Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributed to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributed to Fortress (less the\nSeries A Preferred Dividend) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period, not including\nunvested restricted stock, and without consideration for Common Stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as the basic loss\nper share due to net losses incurred in all periods.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nThe Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations and presents non-\ncontrolling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its consolidated balance sheets. All intercompany income and/or expense\nitems are eliminated entirely in consolidation prior to the allocation of net gain/loss attributable to non-controlling interest, which is based\non a quarterly calculation of ownership interests for each relevant subsidiary.\nSubsidiary preferred shares and Class A common shares, if issued, are included in the ownership calculation on a 1:1 basis consistent with\nhow the relevant contractual agreements provide for the allocation and distribution of earnings. These shares, if any, are convertible at\nFortress’ election on a 1:1 basis into common stock (with adjustments for stock splits, if any) and upon conversion would have the same\nvoting rights as the common stock. Only preferred stock and Class A common stock held by Fortress have majority voting rights, which\nrights would terminate upon conversion into common stock. The Company allocates the subsidiaries’ net loss/income to the non-controlling\ninterest on a quarterly basis, and the\nF-18\nTable of Contents\ncalculation of non-controlling interest ownership percentage is determined as the average of the prior quarter and the current quarter’s non-\ncontrolling ownership interest.\nThe Company continually assesses whether changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in the consolidation or\ndeconsolidation of subsidiaries and/or partner companies.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe Company’s comprehensive loss is equal to its net loss for all periods presented.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant\nsegment expenses. The amendments introduce a new requirement to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”), extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify that single reportable segment entities\nmust apply ASC 280 in its entirety, permit more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and\nrequire disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023,\nand interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption will be permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands\ndisclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Asset Purchase Agreements\nAevitas\nAgreement with 4DMT\nOn April 21, 2023, Aevitas entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “4DMT APA”) with 4DMT under which 4DMT acquired\nAevitas’ proprietary rights to its short-form human complement factor H (“sCFH”) asset for the treatment of complement-mediated\ndiseases. Under the terms of the 4DMT APA, 4DMT will make cash payments totaling up to $140 million if certain late-stage development,\nregulatory and sales milestones are met with respect to sCFH. A range of single-digit royalties on net sales are also payable. The\naforementioned payments are payable solely to Aevitas, and 4DMT will be responsible for license payment obligations to the licensor of\nsCFH, University of Pennsylvania. 4DMT is not a related party to the Company and has assumed all ongoing and future development costs.\nThe fair value of the interest in Aevitas retained by the Company of $2.6 million was based on the risk-adjusted present value of the\naforementioned potential cash payments (see Note 6).\nIn connection with the 4DMT APA, the preferred shares of Aevitas held by the Company converted to Aevitas common shares, at which\npoint the Company no longer maintained voting control of Aevitas. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its holdings in Aevitas. In\nconnection with this transaction, the Company recorded a loss on deconsolidation of Aevitas of $3.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 in other expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nMustang\nAgreements with uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences, Inc. (“uBriGene”)\nOn May 18, 2023, Mustang entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, as amended by a\nfirst amendment thereto, dated June 29, 2023, and further amended by a second amendment thereto, dated as of July 28, 2023 (collectively\nthe “Amended Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Mustang agreed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to sell its\nleasehold interest in its cell processing facility located in Worcester, MA (the “Facility”) and associated assets relating to the manufacturing\nand production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility to uBriGene. On July 28, 2023, the closing date, pursuant to the terms and\nconditions of the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement, Mustang completed the sale of Mustang’s assets primarily relating to the\nmanufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies to uBriGene for base consideration of $6.0 million. Mustang recorded a gain of\n$1.5 million in connection with the sale of the assets and recorded approximately $0.3 million of the base consideration as deferred income,\nto be recognized upon the transfer of the lease. Certain assets, including Mustang’s lease of the Facility and related contracts did not\ntransfer to uBriGene on the Closing date. uBriGene will be obligated to pay to Mustang a contingent amount of $5.0 million less certain\nseverance obligations and payments payable in connection with the transfer of certain contracts related to the transferred assets, if Mustang,\nwithin two years of the closing date: (i) completes one or more issuances of equity securities in an aggregate gross amount equal to or\ngreater than $10.0 million after the closing and (ii) obtains consent of the landlord to the proposed lease transfer within two years after the\nclosing date.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement contemplates that Mustang will seek to procure the consent and approval of the landlord of the Facility,\nWCS-377 Plantation Street, Inc. (the “Landlord”), and the Landlord informed Mustang that it will not consider the lease transfer request\nuntil receipt of the final determination letter from with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”),\nalthough there can be no guarantee that, even if CFIUS does approve the below-described Facility Transaction, the Landlord will approve\nthe lease transfer. In connection with the sale of its leasehold interest in the Facility and associated assets relating to the manufacturing and\nproduction of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (the “Facility Transaction”) to uBriGene and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of\nuBriGene (Jiangsu) Biosciences Co., Ltd., a Chinese contract development and manufacturing organization, Mustang and uBriGene\npreviously submitted a voluntary notice with CFIUS. The current 45-day review period will conclude no later than March 28, 2024. If\nCFIUS does not conclude its review by March 28, 2024, the proceeding will transition to a subsequent 45-day phase as CFIUS further\ninvestigates the Transaction. Unless and until the lease is transferred to uBriGene, Mustang will retain its facility lease and facility\npersonnel, and will continue to occupy the leasehold premises and manufacture there its lead product candidates, including MB-106.\nAs contemplated by the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, Mustang and uBriGene entered into a Manufacturing\nServices Agreement (the “Manufacturing Services Agreement”). Under the Manufacturing Services Agreement, Mustang contracted\nuBriGene to manufacture Mustang’s lead product candidates, including MB-106, and Mustang committed to spend at least $8 million over\na period of two years after the closing of the transaction to purchase manufacturing and related services (the “Manufacturing Services”)\nfrom uBriGene (the “Minimum Commitment”). Mustang paid uBriGene 25% of the Minimum Commitment at the time of signing of the\nManufacturing Services Agreement and will pay the remainder of the Minimum Commitment over the following two years. Subject to\nMustang’s payment of its Minimum Commitment, uBriGene will provide to Mustang a manufacturing rebate, payable in cash at the end of\nthe second year of the Manufacturing Services Agreement term, for any amounts paid for Manufacturing Services in excess of the\nMinimum Commitment (but in no event will such rebate exceed $3 million). In connection with the Manufacturing Services Agreement,\nMustang will provide uBriGene with the customary licenses to use intellectual property rights specific to Mustang’s cell and gene therapies\nto the extent reasonably necessary for uBriGene’s performance under the Manufacturing Services Agreement. Mustang intends to expense\nmanufacturing costs under the Manufacturing Services Agreement and the sub-contracting Manufacturing Services Agreement, pursuant to\nwhich uBriGene contracted with Mustang to perform the Manufacturing Services to be performed by uBriGene under the Manufacturing\nServices Agreement and account for reimbursed costs associated with the agreements as an offset to such expense. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, Mustang has expensed $4.1 million of manufacturing costs under the Manufacturing Services Agreement.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, on the closing date, Mustang and uBriGene entered into a sub-contracting\nManufacturing Services Agreement (the “Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement”). Under the terms of the Sub-Contracting CDMO\nAgreement, Mustang will manufacture its lead product candidates, including MB-106, and may from time to time manufacture other\nproducts as requested by uBriGene. In addition, under the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene agreed to establish\na joint steering committee comprising two representatives from each of Mustang and uBriGene to review, discuss and decide on operational\nmatters relating to the services to be performed by Mustang under such agreement, including matters relating to expenses. For the year\nended December 31, 2023, Mustang received $2.4 million in reimbursed costs and has a receivable of $3.2 million associated with the Sub-\nContracting CDMO Agreement.\nBecause the Facility was not assigned to uBriGene within 120 days following July 28, 2023, so long as the lease has not been so assigned,\nuBriGene may deliver a notice to Mustang indicating its intention to enter into good faith negotiations (the “Repurchase Notice”) to\nprovide for Mustang to repurchase the associated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the\nFacility, re-assume the transferred liabilities and resume all transferred operations. Upon receipt of such Repurchase Notice, Mustang and\nuBriGene have agreed to use our best commercial efforts to negotiate in good faith the terms of any such Repurchase Transaction.\nCyprium\nAgreement with Sentynl\nOn February 24, 2021, Cyprium entered into a development and asset purchase agreement (the “Sentynl APA”) with Sentynl, a U.S.-based\nspecialty pharmaceutical company owned by the Zydus Group. Under the Sentynl APA, Sentynl provided $8.0 million of upfront\ndevelopment funding for Cyprium’s CUTX-101 program, with Cyprium remaining in control of development of such program; upon\napproval of the NDA for CUTX-101 by the FDA, Cyprium would be obligated to assign the NDA and certain other assets pertaining to the\nCUTX-101 program to Sentynl, after which point Sentynl would commercialize the drug and owe Cyprium royalties and regulatory and\nsales milestones.\nThe Sentynl APA contained an alternative “Approval Deadline Transfer” mechanism pursuant to which, in the event that CUTX-101 NDA\napproval had not been obtained by September 30, 2023, then Sentynl could elect, during the subsequent 45-day period, to assume control\nover development of CUTX-101 by effecting a Closing under the Sentynl APA. Cyprium received notice of Sentynl’s election to effect the\nApproval Deadline Transfer during such 45-day period, and the Closing of such transfer occurred in December 2023. The Approval\nDeadline Transfer obligated Sentynl to pay Cyprium $4.5 million in connection with the Closing, which was received by Cyprium in\nDecember 2023 and recorded as collaboration revenue by Fortress in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December\n31, 2023. There are no further obligations required by Cyprium in regards to the $4.5 million.\nFollowing such Closing, Sentynl is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CUTX-101, including\nthe funding of the same. Additionally, Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales\nmilestones under the Agreement, and royalties on net sales of CUTX-101 as follows: (i) 3% of annual net sales up to $75 million; (ii)\n8.75% of annual net sales between $75 million and $100 million; and (iii) 12.5% of annual net sales in excess of $100 million. Cyprium\nwill retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101.\nWith respect to the $8.0 million upfront payment from Sentynl received in 2021, the Company recognized revenue over the period in which\nthe development activities occurred using an input method based upon the costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs to\ncomplete the development activities. As of the date of the Approval Deadline Transfer, the revenue related to the upfront payment has been\nfully recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue from this arrangement of $0.7\nmillion and $1.9 million, respectively.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nAvenue\nAgreements with InvaGen\nIn November 2018, Avenue entered into a Stock Purchase and Merger Agreement (the “Avenue SPMA”) with InvaGen Pharmaceuticals\nInc. In November 2021, Avenue delivered InvaGen notice of termination of the Avenue SPMA and in July 2022, Avenue entered into a\nShare Repurchase Agreement (the “Avenue SRA”) with InvaGen which closed in October 2022. In connection with the closing of the\nAvenue SRA, Avenue repurchased all the common shares of Avenue held by InvaGen, and all of the rights retained by InvaGen pursuant to\nthe Stockholders Agreement entered into by and among Avenue, InvaGen and Fortress on November 12, 2018, were terminated. Under the\nAvenue SRA, Avenue agreed to pay InvaGen seven and a half percent (7.5%) of the proceeds from future financings, up to $4 million.

Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value of Aevitas\nThe Company valued its retained investment in Aevitas, as part of the deconsolidation of its holdings (see Note 3) in accordance with ASC\nTopic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and estimated the fair value to be $2.6 million based on a per share value of $0.328.\nThe following inputs were utilized to derive the value: risk free rate of return of 3.7%, volatility of 80% and a discount for lack of\nmarketability of 39.7%.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock Warrant Liabilities\nWarrants\n($ in thousands) liabilities\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ —\nCheckpoint Series A & B common stock warrants 7,640\nCheckpoint placement agent warrants 278\nAvenue common stock warrants 8,278\nUrica placement agent warrants 90\nChange in fair value of common stock warrants - Avenue (5,669)\nChange in fair value of common stock warrants - Checkpoint 3,252\nBalance at December 31, 2022 13,869\nAvenue common stock warrants 2,235\nUrica placement agent warrants 33\nChange in fair value of common stock warrants - Avenue (4,258)\nChange in fair value of common stock warrants - Checkpoint (7,924)\nChange in fair value of placement agent warrants - Urica 52\nExercise of common stock warrants - Checkpoint (3,121)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 886\nCheckpoint\nOn December 16, 2022, Checkpoint closed on an offering for the sale of shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants as part of a\nregistered direct offering (the “December 2022 Registered Direct Offering”). The common stock and the pre-funded warrants were sold\ntogether with December 2022 Common Stock Warrants and placement agent warrants. Net proceeds to Checkpoint from the December\n2022 Registered Direct Offering were $6.7 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs (see Note 13).\nCheckpoint deemed the December 2022 common warrants and placement agent warrants to be classified as liabilities on the balance sheet\nas they contain terms for redemption of the underlying security that are outside its control. The common warrants and placement agent\nwarrants were recorded at the time of closing at a fair value, determined by using the Black-Scholes model. As the total fair value of the\ncommon stock warrant liability exceeded the total net proceeds, no proceeds were allocated to the common stock and pre-funded warrants\nissued as part of this transaction. Checkpoint revalued the December 2022 common warrants and placement agent warrants at December\n31, 2022 resulting in a fair value of $11.2 million. Checkpoint also revalued the December 2022 Common Stock Warrants and December\n2022 Placement Agent Warrants at each reporting period in 2023, resulting in gains throughout the year.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2023, Checkpoint closed on an offering for the sale of shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants as part of a\nregistered direct offering (the “February 2023 Registered Direct Offering”). The common stock and pre-funded warrants were sold\ntogether with February 2023 Common Stock Warrants and placement agent warrants (collectively, the “February 2023 Common Stock\nWarrants”). The total gross proceeds from the February 2023 Registered Direct Offering were approximately $7.5 million with net proceeds\nof approximately $6.7 million after deducting approximately $0.8 million in commissions and other transaction costs. The February 2023\nCommon Stock Warrants and placement agent warrants met the criteria for equity classification.\nIn October 2023, Checkpoint entered into an inducement offer letter agreement (the “October 2023 Inducement”) with a holder of certain\nof its existing warrants to exercise for cash an aggregate of 6,325,354 shares of the Checkpoint’s common stock at a reduced exercise price\nof $1.76 per share. The exercised warrants included the December 2022 Common Stock Warrants with an original exercise price of $4.075\nper share and the February Common Stock Warrants with an original exercise price of $5.00 per share. These warrants were issued as part\nof the December 2022 Registered Direct Offering and February 2023 Registered Direct Offering. As part of the October 2023 Inducement,\nCheckpoint agreed to issue new unregistered Series A Warrants to purchase up to 6,325,354 shares of Common Stock and new unregistered\nSeries B Warrants to purchase up to 6,325,354 shares of Common Stock (the October 2023 Common Stock Warrants”). Checkpoint also\nissued the placement agent warrants to purchase up to 379,521 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.20 per share. The total\ngross proceeds from the October 2023 Inducement were approximately $11.1 million with net proceeds of approximately $10.0 million\nafter deducting approximately $1.1 million in commissions and other transaction costs. The October 2023 Common Stock Warrants and\nplacement agent warrants met the criteria for equity classification.\nThe December 2022 Common Stock Warrants, which were liability classified, were revalued on October 4, 2023 using Black-Scholes\nModel to calculate the difference in fair value as a result of the change in exercise price. The difference in fair value of $1.2 million was\nrecorded as a loss on common stock warrant liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The issuance of the October 2023\nCommon Stock Warrants was also considered as part of the cost of the inducement and were valued using Black-Scholes Model and\nallocated between the December 2022 Common Stock Warrants and The February 2023 Common Stock Warrants on a weighted basis. The\napproximately $7.7 million allocated to the December 2022 Common Stock Warrants was recorded as loss on common stock warrant\nliabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in-capital.\nThe February 2023 Common Stock Warrants, which were equity classified and treated under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging -\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity, were revalued using Black-Scholes Model to calculate the difference in fair value as a result of the\nchange in exercise price. The difference in fair value of $1.1 million was deemed to be a dividend and recorded to additional paid-in-capital\nby Checkpoint because Checkpoint had an accumulated deficit on the exercise date. The approximately $6.3 million allocated to the\nFebruary 2023 Common Stock Warrants from the issuance of the October 2023 Common Stock Warrants was also deemed to be a dividend\nand recorded to additional paid-in-capital by Checkpoint because Checkpoint had an accumulated deficit on the exercise date.\nCheckpoint\nWarrant\n($ in thousands) Liability\nCommon stock warrant liabilities at December 31, 2021 $ -\nIssuance of Checkpoint common warrants 7,640\nIssuance of placement agent warrants 278\nChange in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities 3,252\nCommon Stock Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2022 11,170\nChange in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities (7,924)\nExercise of common stock warrants (3,121)\nCommon Stock Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2023 $ 125\nA summary of the weighted average (in aggregate) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring the warrant liability\nthat are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy was as follows:\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, October 4, December 31,\nCheckpoint Warrants 2023 2023 2022\nExercise price $ 5.41 $ 1.76 $ 4.08 - 5.41\nVolatility 96.4% 91.4 - 99.6% 82.4 - 89.4%\nExpected life 4.0 0.7 - 4.2 1.5 - 5.0\nRisk-free rate 3.8% 4.7 - 5.4% 4.0 - 4.7%\nAvenue\nAvenue issued freestanding warrants to purchase shares of its common stock in connection with financing activities in October 2022 (the\n“October 2022 Warrants”) and January 2023 (the “January 2023 Warrants”, collectively the “Avenue Warrants”) (see Note 13). The\nAvenue Warrants are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet as they contain terms for redemption of the underlying security that are\noutside of its control. The October 2022 Warrants were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation approach. In connection with the Avenue\nJanuary 2023 Registered Direct Offering (see Note 13) in January 2023, the down-round price protection feature was triggered and the\nexercise price for the October 2022 Warrants was permanently adjusted to $1.55, which was the offering price for the Avenue Registered\nOffering in January 2023. The Black-Scholes model was used to value the October 2022 Warrants and January 2023 Warrants as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the decrease in the fair value of the Avenue Warrants resulted in a decrease in common stock\nwarrant liabilities of $4.3 million, with an offsetting gain recorded in the Statements of Operations.\nAvenue\nWarrant\n($ in thousands) Liability\nCommon stock warrant liabilities at December 31, 2021 $ -\nIssuance of Avenue common warrants 8,278\nChange in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities (5,669)\nCommon Stock Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2022 2,609\nIssuance of Avenue common warrants 2,235\nChange in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities (4,258)\nCommon Stock Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2023 $ 586\nA summary of the weighted average (in aggregate) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring the Avenue warrant\nliability that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy was as follows:\nDecember 31, January 31 December 31\n2023 2023 2022\nStock price $ 0.16 $ 1.38 $ 1.16\nRisk-free interest rate 3.84 - 4.23% 3.90% 4.02%\nExpected dividend yield — — —\nExpected term in years 2.1 - 3.8 3.00 4.78\nExpected volatility 148 - 175% 160% 93%\nUrica\nUrica’s contingently issuable placement agent warrants were issued in connection with Urica’s first close of their preferred offering in\nDecember 2022 (see Note 9).

These affirmative and negative covenants\napply in different instances to Fortress itself, its private subsidiaries, its public subsidiaries, or certain combinations of the foregoing. The\nlimitations on dividends and other distributions have the practical effect of preventing any further issuances by the Company or its private\nsubsidiaries of equity securities with cash dividends or redemption features.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Oaktree Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, (i) maintenance of minimum\nliquidity and (ii) a minimum revenue test that requires Journey’s annual revenue to be equal to or to exceed annual revenue projections set\nforth in the agreement.

Loans under the Credit Facility (the “Term Loans”) mature on December 27, 2027 unless the Credit Facility is\notherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Term Loans accrue interest which is payable quarterly in arrears.\nThe Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month term SOFR (subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The\ninterest rate resets quarterly.\nBeginning in February 2026, Journey is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount\nequal to 7.5% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans. If the total revenue of Journey, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, is\ngreater than $70.0 million as of December 31, 2025, principal repayment is not required until February 2027, at which point Journey is\nrequired to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 15% of the principal amount of\nfunded Term Loans.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nJourney may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in whole or in part. Prepayment of the Term Loans is\nsubject to payment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 2% of the Term Loans prepaid plus the amount of interest that would have been\ndue through the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date if the Term Loans are prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the SWK Closing\nDate, (ii) 1% of the Term Loans prepaid if the Term Loans are prepaid on or after the first anniversary of the SWK Closing Date but prior\nto the second anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, or (iii) 0% if prepaid thereafter.\nUpon repayment in full of the Term Loans, Journey will pay an exit fee equal to 5% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans.\nAdditionally, Journey paid an origination fee of $0.2 million on the SWK Closing Date and incurred issuance costs of $0.2 million, both of\nwhich have been recorded as a debt discount. Journey is accreting the carrying value of the SWK Term Loan to the original principal\nbalance plus the exit fee over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. The amortization of the discount is accounted for as\ninterest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The effective interest rate on the SWK Term Loan for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 was 15.1%.\nThe SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by\nsubstantially all assets of Journey. As of December 31, 2023, Journey was in compliance with the financial covenants under the SWK\nCredit Facility.\nEast West Bank Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt (“EWB Term Loan”)\nJourney was previously party to a Loan and Security Agreement, dated March 31, 2021 (as amended, the “EWB Facility”), with East West\nBank (“EWB”), under which EWB made a $20.0 million term loan and a $10 million revolving line of credit available to Journey. In\nJanuary 2022 and August 2022, Journey borrowed $15 million and $5 million, respectively, against the term loan. During 2023, Journey\nvoluntarily repaid the entire $20 million outstanding term loan principal balance under the EWB Facility. The repayment satisfied all of\nJourney’s outstanding debt obligations under the EWB Facility. Journey has no further obligations to EWB.\nMustang Runway Growth Finance Corp. Debt Facility (“Runway Note”)\nOn April 11, 2023, the long-term debt facility with Runway Growth Finance Corp.

A non-cash contingent warrant value of $0.1 million was also recorded in debt discount\n(see Note 6).\nDividends on the Urica Preferred Stock are payable monthly by Fortress in shares of Fortress Common Stock based upon a 7.5% discount\nto the average trading price over the 10-day period preceding the dividend payment date. Dividends are recorded as interest expense. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded expense of $0.3 million associated with the Urica dividends owed on the\noutstanding Urica Preferred Stock.\nF-32\nTable of Contents\nThe shares mandatorily convert into Urica common stock upon either: (i) a qualified financing pursuant to which Urica raises at least $20\nmillion in aggregate gross proceeds; or (ii) a sale of Urica (in each case, at a 20% discount to the lowest price per share at which Urica\ncommon stock is issued/sold in such transaction). Additionally, in the event that neither such a qualified financing nor a sale of Urica has\noccurred prior to June 27, 2024, then each holder of Urica Preferred Stock is eligible to receive, at Fortress’ election, one of: (x) a cash\npayment equal to the product of the Subscription Price and the number of shares of Urica Preferred Stock held by such holder; (y) a number\nof shares of Fortress common stock equal to the Fortress Share Exchange Amount; or (z) a combination of the foregoing (in each case plus\ncash in lieu of any fractional shares, plus cash in lieu of accumulated and unpaid dividends otherwise payable in Fortress shares up to the\nconversion/exchange date).\nThe Urica Preferred Shares have no voting rights and have liquidation rights on parity with all equity securities issued by Urica, and junior\nto all equity securities issued by Urica with terms outlining senior rank and current and future indebtedness.\nThe Company evaluated the terms of the Urica Preferred Offering under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and determined\nthe instrument met the criteria to be recorded as a liability. The value at conversion does not vary with the value of Urica’s common shares,\ntherefore the settlement provision would not be considered a conversion feature. Accordingly, the Company determined liability\nclassification is appropriate and as such, this instrument was accounted for as a liability.\nHarley Capital LLC (“Harley”) was the primary placement agent for the Urica Offering and received a 10 % fee on gross proceeds raised,\nplus either warrants to purchase 10% of the Urica common stock into which the Urica Preferred Stock converts (in the event of a sale of\nUrica or a qualified financing) or 10% of the Company common stock for which the Urica Preferred Stock is exchanged (in the event\nneither a sale of Urica nor a qualified financing occurs), in addition to reimbursement of legal and other expenses (see Note 6).\nInterest Expense\nThe following table shows the details of interest expense for all debt arrangements during the periods presented.

Net Loss per Common Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributed to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributed to Fortress (less the\nSeries A Preferred dividends) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period, not including\nunvested restricted stock, and without consideration for Common Stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as the basic loss\nper share due to net losses in all periods.\nThe Company updated its presentation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and its net loss per share as an immaterial correction\nto reflect the preferred stock dividend of $2.0 million per quarter. The statement of changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and statement\nof cash flows reflected the dividend and as such are not impacted by this change in presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2022, in\naddition to being retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split (see Note 1), the net loss attributable to Fortress increased\nfrom ($86.6) million to ($94.6) million and the net loss per share increased from ($14.61) to ($15.97) per share to reflect the preferred stock\ndividend.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nThe following shares of potentially dilutive securities, weighted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been excluded\nfrom the computations of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as the effect of including such securities would be anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nWarrants to purchase Common Stock 873,065 233,057\nOptions to purchase Common Stock 32,601 48,317\nUnvested Restricted Stock 1,362,880 1,225,000\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units 151 2,608\nTotal 2,268,697 1,508,982\n13.

The Reverse Stock Split was approved on August 10,\n2023, by the Company’s Board of Directors and by the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting held on October 9, 2023. As a result of\nthe Reverse Stock Split, every 15 shares of the Company’s pre-reverse split Common Stock was combined and reclassified as one share of\nCommon Stock. The proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split,\nother than as the result of payment for fractional shares. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\nStockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of Common Stock received a cash payment in lieu thereof.\nAll share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented, unless\notherwise indicated. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the\nexercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding at October 10, 2023, which resulted in a proportional\ndecrease in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options,\nrestricted stock and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock\noptions and warrants.\nCommon Stock\nFortress’ Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Company to issue 200,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock\nof which 15,093,053 and 7,366,283 shares of Common Stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe terms, rights, preference and privileges of the Common Stock are as follows:\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of the\nstockholders, including the election of directors.

There have been no claims to date, and the Company has director and officer insurance to address such claims. The Company and\nits subsidiaries and partner companies also provide indemnification of contractual counterparties (sometimes without monetary caps) to\nclinical sites, service providers and licensors.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries may be subject to both insured and uninsured litigation. Suits and\nclaims may be brought against the Company by customers, suppliers, partners and/or third parties (including tort claims for personal injury\narising from clinical trials of the Company’s product candidates and property damage) alleging deficiencies in performance, breach of\ncontract, etc., and seeking resulting alleged damages.\nUniversity of Tennessee Research Foundation v. Caelum Biosciences, Inc.\nCaelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), a former subsidiary of Fortress that was sold to AstraZeneca’s Alexion (“Alexion”) in October 2021,\nis the defendant in a lawsuit brought by The University of Tennessee Research Foundation (“UTRF”) captioned as University of Tennessee\nResearch Foundation v. Caelum Biosciences, Inc., No. 19-cv-00508, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Tennessee (the “UTRF Litigation”). UTRF brought claims against Caelum, for, inter alia, tortious interference and trade secret\nmisappropriation. UTRF primarily alleges that Caelum unauthorizedly used non-patent trade secrets owned by UTRF in the development\nof Caelum’s 11-1F4 monoclonal antibody, known as CAEL-101. Under the agreement pursuant to which Alexion acquired Caelum (as\namended, the “DOSPA”), Fortress has indemnification obligations of Caelum under certain circumstances, including for certain of\nCaelum’s legal expenses and potential damages arising out of the UTRF Litigation (with such indemnification capped in the aggregate as to\nFortress at the amount of Caelum acquisition proceeds received by Fortress and which, at Caelum’s election, may be satisfiable in the form\nof offsets against future amounts that Caelum may owe Fortress under the DOSPA). Caelum is defending the UTRF Litigation, with\nFortress participating in such defense and maintaining a consent right over any potential settlements. Caelum’s legal fees and costs in\ndefending the UTRF Litigation are being reimbursed by Fortress by distribution from a $15 million escrow account established\nconcurrently with the acquisition of Caelum; Fortress considers the amount remaining in escrow to be in excess of the amount of its\nanticipated out-of-pocket indemnifiable costs and damages in the UTRF Litigation and therefore has not accrued any liability pertaining to\nthis indemnity. Caelum and Fortress both believe the UTRF Litigation is without merit and intend to continue defending it vigorously\n(including exhausting all appeals if applicable). Caelum’s motion for summary judgment on all claims is currently pending, and a trial is\nscheduled for September 2024 with respect to any of UTRF’s claims that may survive summary judgment.\n15. Employee Benefit Plan\nOn January 1, 2008, the Company adopted a defined contribution 401(k) plan which allows employees to contribute up to a percentage of\ntheir compensation, subject to IRS limitations and provides for a discretionary Company match up to a maximum of 4% of employee\ncompensation.

Checkpoint believes that by partnering with TGTX to develop these compounds in therapeutic areas outside of its business focus, it\nmay substantially offset its preclinical costs and milestone costs related to the development and marketing of these compounds in solid\ntumor indications. Effective September 30, 2023, Checkpoint and TGTX agreed to mutually terminate both the collaboration agreement\nand the sublicense agreement.\nShared Services Agreement with Journey\nIn November 2021, Journey and the Company entered into an arrangement to share the cost of certain legal, finance, regulatory, and\nresearch and development employees.

Under the\nContribution Agreement, the Company also agreed to assign to Avenue certain intercompany agreements existing between Fortress and\nBaergic, including a Founders Agreement, by and between Fortress and Baergic, dated as of March 9, 2017, and Management Services\nAgreement, by and between Fortress and Baergic, dated as of March 9, 2017. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the\nContribution Agreement was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including, inter alia: (i) the closing of an equity\nfinancing by Avenue resulting in gross proceeds of at least $7.5 million, (ii) the agreement by minority Avenue shareholder InvaGen to (A)\nhave 100% of its shares in Avenue repurchased by Avenue and (B) terminate certain of the agreements to which it was party with Avenue\nand/or the Company in connection with InvaGen’s 2019 equity investment in Avenue, which eliminated certain negative consent rights of\nInvaGen over Avenue and restore certain rights and privileges of Fortress in Avenue; and (iii) the sustained listing of Avenue’s common\nstock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On October 11, 2022, Avenue announced the closing of an underwritten public offering in which it\nreceived net proceeds of approximately $10.4 million (see Note 13). The offering, together with the October 2022 repurchase of Avenue\ncommon shares held by InvaGen, resulted in the consummation of the Contribution Agreement in November 2022 (see Note 3). As a result,\nBaergic became a majority-controlled and owned subsidiary company of Avenue.\nCyprium 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock Dividend Obligation\nPursuant to a private placement in August 2020, Cyprium sold shares of its 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred\nStock (“Cyprium PPS”); as of December 31, 2023, there are 300,600 shares of Cyprium PPS outstanding.\nPursuant to the terms of the Cyprium PPS, shareholders on the record date are entitled to receive a monthly cash dividend of $0.19531 per\nshare which yields an annual dividend of $2.34375 per share. The Cyprium PPS will automatically be redeemed upon the first (and only the\nfirst) bona fide, arm’s-length sale of a Priority Review Voucher (a “PRV Sale”) issued by the FDA in connection with the approval of\nCUTX-101, a product candidate previously developed by Cyprium. Upon the PRV Sale, each share of Cyprium PPS will be automatically\nredeemed in exchange for a payment equal to twice the $25.00 liquidation preference, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date.\nAn optional exchange for Fortress Series A Preferred Stock is available after 24 months from the issuance date so long as a sale of the PRV\nhas not occurred. Additionally, if a PRV Sale has not occurred by September 30, 2024, the Cyprium PPS is either automatically exchanged\nfor Fortress Series A Preferred Stock or cash at the discretion of Fortress. The Cyprium PPS is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by\nFortress.\nF-50\nTable of Contents\nFounders Agreement and Management Services Agreement\nThe Company has entered into Founders Agreements with each of the Fortress partner companies and subsidiaries listed in the table below.\nPursuant to each Founders Agreement, in exchange for the time and capital expended in the formation of each partner company/subsidiary\nand the identification of specific assets the acquisition of which result in the formation of a viable emerging growth life science company,\nFortress will loan each such partner company/subsidiary an amount representing the up-front fee required to acquire assets. Each Founders\nAgreement has a term of 15 years, which upon expiration automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by the\nCompany or a Change in Control (as defined in the Founders Agreement) occurs. In connection with each Founders Agreement the\nCompany receives 250,000 Class A Preferred shares (except for that with Checkpoint, in which the Company holds Class A Common\nStock).\nThe Class A Preferred Stock (Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint) is identical to common stock other than as to voting\nrights, conversion rights and the Payment-in-Kind (“PIK”) Dividend right (as described below). Each share of Class A Preferred Stock\n(Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint) is entitled to vote the number of votes that is equal to one and one-tenth (1.1) times a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding common stock and (B) the whole shares of common stock into\nwhich the shares of outstanding Class A Preferred Stock (Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint) are convertible and the\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of outstanding Class A Preferred Stock (Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint).\nThus, the Class A Preferred Stock (Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint) will at all times constitute a voting majority. Each\nshare of Class A Preferred Stock (Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint) is convertible, at the holder’s option, into one fully\npaid and nonassessable share of common stock of such partner company/subsidiary, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe holders of Class A Preferred Stock (and the Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint), as a class, are entitled receive on each\neffective date or “Trigger Date” (defined as the date that the Company first acquired, whether by license or otherwise, ownership rights to a\nproduct) of each agreement (each a “PIK Dividend Payment Date”) until the date all outstanding Class A Preferred Stock (Class A\nCommon Stock with respect to Checkpoint) is converted into common stock or redeemed (and the purchase price is paid in full), pro rata\nper share dividends paid in additional fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (“PIK Dividends”) such that the aggregate\nnumber of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such PIK Dividend is equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of such partner\ncompany or subsidiary’s fully-diluted outstanding capitalization on the date that is one (1) business day prior to any PIK Dividend Payment\nDate. The Company has reached agreements with several of the partner companies and subsidiaries to change the PIK Dividend Interest\nPayment Date to January 1 of each year - a change that has not and will not result in the issuance of any additional partner\ncompany/subsidiary common stock beyond that amount to which the Company would otherwise be entitled absent such change(s). The\nCompany owns 100% of the Class A Preferred Stock (Class A Common Stock with respect to Checkpoint) of each partner\ncompany/subsidiary that has a Founders Agreement with the Company.\nAs additional consideration under the Founders Agreement, each partner company and subsidiary with which the Company has entered into\na Founders Agreement will also: (i) pay an equity fee in shares of the common stock of such partner company/subsidiary, payable within\nfive (5) business days of the closing of any equity or debt financing for each partner company/subsidiary or any of its respective\nsubsidiaries that occurs after the effective date of the Founders Agreement and ending on the date when the Company no longer has\nmajority voting control in such partner company or subsidiary’s voting equity, equal to two and one-half (2.5%) of the gross amount of any\nsuch equity or debt financing; and (ii) pay a cash fee equal to four and one-half percent (4.5%) of such partner company or subsidiary’s\nannual net sales, payable on an annual basis, within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year. In the event of a Change in Control,\neach such partner company/subsidiary will pay a one-time change in control fee equal to five (5x) times the product of (A) net sales for the\ntwelve (12) months immediately preceding the change in control and (B) four and one-half percent (4.5%). In the case of Urica, however,\nthe obligation to pay Fortress royalties under the Founders Agreement would survive any such Change in Control.\nF-51\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes, by subsidiary, the effective date of the Founders Agreements and PIK dividend or equity fee payable to\nthe Company in accordance with the terms of the Founders Agreements, Exchange Agreements and the partner companies’/subsidiaries’\ncertificates of incorporation.\nPIK Dividend as\na % of fully\ndiluted\noutstanding Class of Stock\nPartner Company/Subsidiary Effective Date 1 capitalization Issued\nAvenue February 17, 2015 2.5%2 Common Stock\nBaergic December 17, 2019 5 2.5%3 Common Stock\nCellvation October 31, 2016 2.5% Common Stock\nCheckpoint March 17, 2015 -%4 Common Stock\nCyprium March 13, 2017 2.5% Common Stock\nHelocyte March 20, 2015 2.5% Common Stock\nMustang March 13, 2015 2.5% Common Stock\nOncogenuity April 22, 2020 5 2.5% Common Stock\nUrica November 7, 2017 5 2.5% Common Stock\nNote 1: Represents the effective date of each subsidiary’s Founders Agreement.

Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for\nfinancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nThe components of the income tax provision are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nCurrent\nFederal $ 33 $ —\nState 254 449\nDeferred\nFederal 194 —\nState 39 —\nTotal $ 521 $ 449\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, income tax expense was $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, resulting in an\neffective income tax rate of -0.3% and -0.2%. The income tax expense in 2023 is primarily due to uncovered deferred tax liabilities with\nrespect to investments in subsidiaries, state income taxes and interest accrued related to a prior years' uncertain tax position.\nThe Company has incurred net operating losses since inception. The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss\ncarryforwards (“NOL”) in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and has established a valuation allowance of $366.4 million\nagainst its net deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses\nand tax credit carryforwards.\nF-54\nTable of Contents\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred taxes consist of the following:\nAs of December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 211,329 $ 198,250\nAmortization of license fees 33,996 30,151\nAmortization of in-process R&D 315 334\nStock compensation 13,184 13,754\nLease liability 6,477 7,011\nAccruals and reserves 3,897 3,402\nTax credits 37,894 33,501\nStartup costs 40 42\nUnrealized gain/loss on investments 55 406\nSection 174 R&D expenditure capitalization 59,238 34,170\nState taxes 33 192\nBusiness interest limitation 2,880 2,359\nReserve on Sales Return, Discount and Bad Debt 4,556 2,286\nTotal deferred tax assets 373,895 325,858\nLess: valuation allowance (366,375) (317,959)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 7,520 $ 7,899\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nSection 483 imputed interest $ (25) $ (92)\nDebt issuance costs (297) (347)\nRight of use asset (5,289) (5,835)\nBasis in subsidiary (2,142) (1,625)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities, net $ (233) $ —\nA reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rates is as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nPercentage of pre-tax income:\nU.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0% 21.0%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 10.6% 6.7%\nCredits 3.1% 4.6\nNon-deductible items (0.9)% (0.5)%\nProvision to return (0.7)% 1.8%\nStock based compensation shortfall (2.0)% (1.4)%\nChange in state rate 4.1% (1.6)%\nChange in valuation allowance (31.5)% (31.3)%\nChange in subsidiary basis (1.0)% —%\nDeconsolidation/dissolution of subsidiaries (2.4)% —%\nAdjustment for warrants 0.9% 0.1%\nSection 162(m) compensation disallowance (1.2)% (0.8)%\nOther (0.3)% 1.2%\nEffective income tax rate (0.3)% (0.2)%\nF-55\nTable of Contents\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return with subsidiaries for which the Company has an 80% or greater ownership interest.\nSubsidiaries and partner companies for which the Company does not have an 80% or more ownership are not included in the Company’s\nconsolidated income tax group and file their own separate income tax return. As a result, certain corporate entities included in these\nfinancial statements are not able to combine or offset their taxable income or losses with other entities’ tax attributes.\nASC 740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of all positive and negative\nevidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax\nassets is substantially dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within certain future periods. Management\nhas considered the Company’s history of cumulative tax and book losses incurred since inception, and the other positive and negative\nevidence, and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the net deferred tax assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The valuation allowance increased by a net $48.4 million during the current year.\nThe Company has incurred net operating losses (“NOLs”) since inception. At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal NOLs of\n$714.4 million, which will begin to expire in the year 2032, state NOLs of $970.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2026, and federal\nincome tax credits of $33.8 million and state income tax credits of $5.2 million, which will begin to expire in 2028. Approximately $518.9\nmillion of the federal NOLs and $16.2 million of the state NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely. Under the provisions of Section 382 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change”, as defined therein, is subject to limitations on its use of\npre-change NOLs and income tax credits carryforwards to offset future tax liabilities. It appears the Company underwent previous\nownership changes potentially limiting its use of tax attributes. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on all of its deferred\ntax assets, as it believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized regardless of whether an “ownership\nchange” has occurred.\nIn accordance with the provisions related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes the benefit of tax position\nif the position is “more likely than not” to prevail upon examination by the relevant tax authority. The table below sets forth a\nreconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the company added $3.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If the $3.2 million of unrecognized\ntax benefits is recognized, approximately $0.7 million would affect the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the\nunrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the Company’s recognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext 12 months. At this time, the estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The Company has accrued for $0.1\nmillion and approximately $32,000 of such interest as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No penalties have been accrued for.\nThe NOLs from tax years 2010 through 2023 remain open to examination (and adjustment) by the Internal Revenue Service and state\ntaxing authorities. In addition, federal tax years ending December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are open for assessment of federal taxes. The\nexpiration of the statute of limitations related to the various state income and franchise tax returns varies by state.\n18.

The following descriptions of our Common Stock, preferred stock and warrants are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our Third Amended and Restated\nBylaws (the “Bylaws”) and our outstanding warrants. We encourage you to read the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and warrants, as well as the\napplicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”), for more information.\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nThe following summary of the terms of our common stock may not be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the\nterms and provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. You should refer to, and read this\nsummary together with, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws to review all of the terms of our common stock that may\nbe important to you.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Company to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common\nstock (“Common Stock”). Our Common Stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FBIO.”\nThe terms, rights, preference and privileges of the Common Stock are as follows:\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders,\nincluding the election of directors. The Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting rights.\nDividends\nSubject to preferences that may be applicable to any then-outstanding preferred stock, the holders of the Company’s outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors out of legally available\nfunds.\nLiquidation\nIn the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets\nlegally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of the Company’s debts and other liabilities, subject to the satisfaction of any\nliquidation preference granted to the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nRights and Preference\nHolders of the Company’s Common Stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights, and there is no redemption or sinking fund\nprovisions applicable to our Common Stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of Common Stock are subject to, and may be adversely\naffected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of the Company’s preferred stock that are or may be issued.\nFully Paid and Nonassessable\nAll of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.\nPreferred Stock\nUnder the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of\npreferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. Our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval,\nand has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights,\nredemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. We may amend from time to time our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. Any such amendment would require the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote thereon. As of the current date, we have 15,000,000 shares of preferred shares authorized, which\nincludes the 5,000,000 shares of our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) (as defined below). At\npresent, 3,427,138 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. No other classes of preferred stock have been designated or issued at\nthis time.\nIt is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock upon the rights of the holders of Common Stock until the\nboard of directors determines the specific rights of the holders of preferred stock. However, effects of the issuance of preferred stock include restricting\ndividends on Common Stock, diluting the voting power of Common Stock, impairing the liquidation rights of Common Stock, and making it more difficult\nfor a third party to acquire us, which could have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring, or deterring a third party from paying a premium to\nacquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nThe particular terms of any new series of preferred stock being offered by us will set forth in a certificate of designations relating to that series of\npreferred stock. Those terms may include:\n● the title and liquidation preference per share of the preferred stock and the number of shares offered;\n● the purchase price of the preferred stock;\n● the dividend rate (or method of calculation);\n● the dates on which dividends will be paid and the date from which dividends will begin to accumulate;\n● any redemption or sinking fund provisions of the preferred stock;\n● any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange or market;\n● any conversion provisions of the preferred stock;\n● the voting rights, if any, of the preferred stock; and\n● any additional dividend, liquidation, redemption, sinking fund and other rights, preferences, privileges, limitations and restrictions of the preferred\nstock.\nThe preferred stock will, when issued, be fully paid and non-assessable.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn October 26, 2017, the Company designated 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”).

If a registration statement registering the offer and sale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants under the Securities Act is\nnot effective or available and an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is not available for the issuance of such shares, the holder may elect\nto exercise the November 2023 Warrants through a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of shares\nof Common Stock determined according to the formula set forth in the November 2023 Warrants. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued in\nconnection with the exercise of a warrant.

There may only be one such adjustment, if any, to the exercise price while the November 2023\nWarrants are outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustments will be made in respect of an Exempt Issuance (as defined in the November 2023\nWarrants.

(“Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to\nadopt this Clawback Policy (“Policy”) which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as\ndefined below).\nThis Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(“Exchange Act”), and final rules and amendments adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to implement the aforementioned\nlegislation, and Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange’s listing standards.\nThis policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023, the Effective Date of Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange’s listing standards (the “Effective\nDate”) and applies to all Covered Officers (as defined below) of Fortress Biotech, Inc.\nAdministration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (if composed entirely of independent directors) or if so designated by the\nBoard, a separate committee of the Board, consisting of a majority of the independent directors serving on the board (as applicable, the “Administrator”).\nThe Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the\nadministration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform\nwith respect to each individual covered by the Policy. In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the\nfull Board or such other committees of the Board, such as the Audit Committee or the Compensation Committee, as may be necessary or appropriate as to\nmatters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority.\nSubject to any limitation under applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all\nactions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such\nofficer or employee).\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions will apply:\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with\nany financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including those that either (a) correct an error in a previously issued financial statement that\nis material to such previously issued financial statement or (b) correct an error that is not material to a previously issued financial statement but would\nresult in a material misstatement if left uncorrected in a current report or the error correction was not recognized in the current period.\n“Administrator” has the meaning set forth in the “Administration” section above.\n“Board” means the Company’s Board of Directors.\n\"Clawback Exception” has the meaning ascribed to such term in the “Clawback Exceptions” section below.\n“Covered Officer” means the Company’s officers for purposes of Section 16 under the Exchange Act during any portion of the performance period of the\nIncentive-Based Compensation.\n“Excess Compensation” means any amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Officer that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated financial information or properly calculated financial\nmeasure. Excess Compensation shall be calculated on a pre-tax basis.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any non-equity incentive plan awards, bonuses paid from a bonus pool, cash awards, equity or equity-based\nawards, or proceeds received upon sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan; provided that such compensation is granted, earned, and/or vested\nbased wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial performance measure, as determined in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the\nNasdaq Stock Exchange listing standards (the “Clawback Rules”). Incentive-Based Compensation does not include any salaries, discretionary bonuses,\nnon-equity incentive plan awards earned upon satisfying a strategic measure or operational measure (e.g., completion of a project), or equity-based awards\nthat are not contingent on achieving any financial reporting measure (e.g., time vested stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units).\n“Look-Back Period” means the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of the date on which (a) the Board or appropriate\ncommittee concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that an Accounting Restatement is required or (b) a regulator directs an Accounting\nRestatement.\n“Received” means any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received during the fiscal year in which the applicable financial reporting measure upon\nwhich the payment is based is achieved, even if payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of such period.\nClawback Due to Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator shall require reimbursement or forfeiture\n(“clawback”) of any Excess Compensation Received by any Covered Officer (current or former) during the applicable Look-Back Period, regardless of\nwhether the Covered Officer engaged in misconduct or was otherwise directly or indirectly responsible, in whole or in part, for the Accounting\nRestatement.\nIn the event the Administrator cannot determine the Excess Compensation from the information in the Accounting Restatement or from the\nrecalculated financial measure, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement or\nrecalculation. Such determination will be final and binding.\nIf a Clawback Exception applies with respect to a Covered Officer, the Company may forgo the recovery described in this Section from such\nCovered Officer.\nClawback Method\nThe Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, the method for the clawback of any amounts due under this Policy, which may include\nwithout limitation direct payment from the Covered Officer, recovery over time, the forfeiture or reduction of future pay or awards, or any other method\nthat will provide for recovery within a reasonable manner and without undue delay. The Company may enter into deferred payment plans with Covered\nOfficers to effectuate clawback to avoid unreasonable economic hardship. Any amounts due under this Policy may be deducted as an offset from amounts\ndue to the Covered Officer from the Company, except to the extent such set-off is prohibited by law or would violate Section 409A of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended and the regulations thereunder.\nClawback Exceptions\nThe Company will be required, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, to recover all Excess Compensation received by a Covered Officer\nduring the Look-Back Period unless: (i) one of the following conditions is met; and (ii) the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be\nimpracticable in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act:\n(i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount\nto be recovered (and the Company has already made a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Excess Compensation\nfrom such Covered Officer, has documented such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and has provided such documentation to the Nasdaq\nStock Exchange);\n(ii) recovery would violate home country laws that existed at the time of adoption of the rule and the Company receives an opinion of\ncounsel to that effect; or\n(iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations\nthereunder. For purposes of clarity, this Clawback Exception only applies to tax-qualified retirement plans and does not apply to other\nplans, including long term disability, life insurance, and supplemental executive retirement plans, or any other compensation that is based\non Incentive-Based Compensation in such plans, such as earnings accrued on notional amounts of Incentive-Based Compensation\ncontributed to such plans.\nGeneral\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Officer against the loss of any covered compensation as a result of the application of this Policy.\nThis Policy is in addition to (and not in lieu of) any right of repayment, forfeiture or right of offset against any employees that is required pursuant\nto any statutory repayment requirement (regardless of whether implemented at any time prior to or following the adoption or amendment of this Policy),\nincluding Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any amounts paid to the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nshall be considered in determining any amounts recovered under this Policy.\nThe terms of this Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Officers subject to this Policy and their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, or other legal representatives. If any provision of this Policy or the application of such provision to any Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to\nbe invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the\ninvalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision (or the application of\nsuch provision) valid, legal or enforceable.\nEach Covered Officer shall sign and return to the Company, within the later of: (i) 60 calendar days following the Effective Date or (ii) 30\ncalendar days following the date the individual becomes a Covered Officer, the Acknowledgement and Agreement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A,\npursuant to which the Covered Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.\nTo the extent the Clawback Rules require recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation in additional circumstances beyond those specified above,\nnothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover Incentive-Based Compensation to the fullest\nextent required by the Clawback Rules.\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time-to-time in its discretion and as necessary to comply with any rules or standards adopted by the SEC\nand the listings standards of any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nExhibit A\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (the “Company”)\nClawback Policy\nAcknowledgement and Agreement Form\nI, the undersigned, acknowledge and agree that I have received and reviewed the Clawback Policy of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (the “Policy”), effective as of\nOctober 2, 2023, as adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, I acknowledge and agree:\n● that I am fully bound by, and subject to, all of the terms and conditions of the Policy, as may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise\nmodified from time to time.\n● that I have been designated as a “Covered Officer” as defined in the policy.\n● that my execution of this Acknowledgement and Agreement Form is in consideration of, and is a condition to, my continued employment (if\ncurrently an employee) and my receipt of future awards from the Company, though nothing in this Acknowledgement and Agreement Form shall\nobligate the Company to make any particular award.\nIn the event of any inconsistency between the Policy and the terms of any employment agreement to which I am a party, or to the terms of any\ncompensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement under which any incentive-based compensation covered by the Policy is payable, the terms of this\nPolicy shall govern and shall be deemed incorporated into all such plans, programs, agreements (including any employment agreements) or arrangements,\nincluding and without limitation, those granted or awarded prior to the date hereof and those granted or awarded in the future.\nIn the event any Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined in the Policy) is subject to recoupment or recovery under the terms of the Policy, I will\npromptly take any action necessary to effectuate the recoupment or recovery of such compensation by the Company.\nCOVERED OFFICER\nSignature\nPrint Name\nDate"
