Notes Average Discount of Net Asset Value per Share to Stock Price for Eleventh Month of Initial Measurement Period of Its Discount Management Program\") December 02, 2024\n\nMONTCLAIR, N.J., Dec. 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 180 Degree Capital Corp. (“180 Degree Capital”) (NASDAQ: TURN), noted today that the average discount between its estimated daily net asset value per share (“NAV”) and its daily closing stock price during November 2024 and year-to-date through the end of November 2024, were approximately 21% and 20%, respectively.1 This discount was approximately 26% on November 29, 2024, the last day of trading of the month.\n\nAs previously disclosed in a press release on November 13, 2023, 180 Degree Capital’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has set two measurement periods of 1) January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, and 2) January 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025, in which it will evaluate the average discount between TURN’s estimated daily NAV and its closing stock price pursuant to a Discount Management Program. Should TURN’s common stock trade at an average daily discount to NAV of more than 12% during either of these measurement periods, the Board will consider all available options at the end of each measurement period including, but not limited to, a significant expansion of 180 Degree Capital’s current stock buyback program of up to $5 million, cash distributions reflecting a return of capital to shareholders, a tender offer, or other strategic options.\n\n“While it has certainly taken longer than we anticipated or desired, November 2024 provides an example of the type of performance that we continue to believe is possible in future periods,” said Kevin M. Rendino, Chief Executive Officer of 180 Degree Capital. “For the month of November, our NAV increased by approximately 26%. Our investment thesis in Brightcove, Inc. (BCOV), ultimately proved correct with its announced sale to Bending Spoons for approximately $233 million, or $4.45 per share. The cost basis of our position immediately prior to this announcement was approximately $2.55 per share. As we noted in our release discussing the transaction, BCOV is a perfect example of the companies we seek to invest in. We believe we have additional companies with similar profiles in our portfolio and are actively working with them through our constructive activism to lead to what we believe could be significant value-unlocking events.”\n\n“In addition to the BCOV announcement, our strong performance in November 2024, was aided by our active portfolio management throughout the month,” added Daniel B. Wolfe, President of 180 Degree Capital. “We increased certain positions on weakness following earnings announcements that proceeded to increase in value from their lows. We also took advantage of the sudden increase in value of Quantum Corporation (QMCO) to monetize our position in that company. In November, QMCO advanced from a low closing price per share of $2.96 to a high closing price per share of $21.77. We sold the entirety of our approximately 223,000 shares of QMCO into this rally. We believe the rally was driven by posts on Reddit and the market’s near-term obsession with owning quantum computing-related companies. While QMCO is not technically a quantum computing company, we believe it likely benefited from having “quantum” in its name. Yes, that is crazy to us, but such naïve and incorrect associations are becoming all too common in the public markets.”\n\nMr. Rendino concluded, “As 180 Degree Capital’s Board continues to evaluate all potential options regarding our Discount Management Program, it is important to remember that 180 Degree Capital itself is in a position of strength to drive value creation for its shareholders. I cannot say it enough, the 12.7% ownership position of management and the Board of 180 Degree Capital, built largely through open market purchases, should make it abundantly clear that there is alignment of interests with regard to taking steps to increase 180 Degree Capital’s stock price and create value for all shareholders. Our gross total return on our public portfolio holdings of approximately +212% since 180 Degree Capital’s inception in 2017 through November 30, 2024, was approximately 2.7x the approximately +79% total return of the Russell Microcap Index. We believe this performance kept 180 Degree Capital’s predecessor company from potential insolvency given that the decline in our NAV over the same period of approximately 31% was largely due to declines in the value of the legacy private portfolio. Our public market performance has been the primary source of value creation since 2017. While the increase in NAV for November 2024 of approximately 26% is not an indication of future returns, it demonstrates what we continue to believe is possible from a concentrated portfolio of what we believe to be undervalued companies. BCOV was a core position. We have additional core positions that we currently believe have similar or larger upside to their current valuations. We will continue to focus on creating value for all of 180 Degree Capital’s shareholders, and we look forward to discussing these efforts in more detail as we are able to do so.”\n\n**About 180 Degree Capital Corp.**\n\n180 Degree Capital Corp. is a publicly traded registered closed-end fund focused on investing in and providing value-added assistance through constructive activism to what we believe are substantially undervalued small, publicly traded companies that have potential for significant turnarounds.

The Company also published a letter to shareholders that can be viewed at\nhttps://ir.180degreecapital.com/financial-results.\n“While the first three quarters of 2024 have proven challenging for small and\nmicrocapitalization stocks on a relative basis and our holdings on an absolute basis, we\nbelieve that we are at an inflection point in the cycle where interest is returning to our\ninvestment universe, particularly for companies that are performing,” said Kevin M. Rendino,\nChief Executive Officer of 180 Degree Capital. “We continue to believe there is significant\nopportunity going forward for small capitalization stocks, particularly given the backdrop of\ntheir historically low valuations in general and relative to large capitalization stocks. I have\nseen this play out time and time again during my 35+ years of experience through these\ntypes of investment cycles. While it is always possible this time is different, recent market\ntrends have similar characteristics to those that, upon reflection, turn out to be market\nbottoms heightened by excess pessimism that can be followed by periods of strong\ngrowth.”\n“The absence of information breeds uncertainty and fear, particularly for the stocks in which\nwe invest,” continued Daniel B. Wolfe, President of 180 Degree Capital. “Tax-loss selling\nand low liquidity result in significant volatility that is often independent from the reality of the\nstate of these businesses. This is why we, as fundamental investors, get to know\nmanagement teams, understand markets, and position ourselves to take advantage of\nmarket dislocations. We are particularly encouraged by the reports from a number of our\nlargest holdings during this earnings cycle that we believe position them for additional growth\nand stock price appreciation. We look forward to discussing these updates on our\nshareholder call and with investors throughout the quarter.”\nThe table below summarizes 180’s performance over periods of time through the end of Q3\n20241:\nInception\nQuarter YTD 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year\nto Date\nQ4 2023- Q3 2023- Q3 2021- Q3 2019- Q4 2016-\nQ3 2024\nQ3 2024 Q3 2024 Q3 2024 Q3 2024 Q3 2024\nTURN Public Portfolio Gross Total Return (Excluding\n-0.4% -6.3% 0.2% -42.4% -10.7% 165.1%\nSMA Carried Interest)\nTURN Public Portfolio Gross Total Return (Including\n-0.4% -6.3% 0.2% -40.9% -4.7% 182.5%\nSMA Carried Interest)\nChange in NAV -2.2% -12.4% -10.4% -57.6% -51.9% -37.3%\nChange in Stock Price -11.0% -17.7% -20.4% -53.5% -47.4% -18.5%\nRussell Microcap Index 8.3% 7.4% 24.7% -10.9% 49.8% 59.2%\nRussell Microcap Growth Index 8.6% 6.9% 23.6% -27.2% 31.5% 37.4%\nRussell Microcap Value Index 8.2% 5.2% 22.8% 0.1% 58.1% 70.5%\nRussell 2000 Index 9.3% 11.2% 26.7% 5.5% 56.4% 82.1%\nMr. Rendino and Mr. Wolfe will host a conference call tomorrow, Friday, November 15, 2024,\nat 9am Eastern Time, to discuss the results from Q3 2024 and developments to date during\nQ4 2024.

(NASDAQ:TURN) (“180 Degree Capital” and the “Company”), today reported its financial results as of September 30, 2024, and noted additional developments from the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company also published a letter to shareholders that can be viewed at [https://ir.180degreecapital.com/financial-results](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iWC7DXOFfjTWUTHsQqlUqKxa7vkwIdictkCogeNQee_ezqBPkYUT81IuAePFVBD-Qcal3M0OZ9Hgu1_T6ZfdfjdR1PPmObl5NgidNgMSLJJARR-D0OPBow2pfHePh442ysQAdonYAvZblZM33n_SRGMAh62J8QK0fcrS0YQzDao=).\n\n“While the first three quarters of 2024 have proven challenging for small and microcapitalization stocks on a relative basis and our holdings on an absolute basis, we believe that we are at an inflection point in the cycle where interest is returning to our investment universe, particularly for companies that are performing,” said Kevin M. Rendino, Chief Executive Officer of 180 Degree Capital. “We continue to believe there is significant opportunity going forward for small capitalization stocks, particularly given the backdrop of their historically low valuations in general and relative to large capitalization stocks. I have seen this play out time and time again during my 35+ years of experience through these types of investment cycles. While it is always possible this time is different, recent market trends have similar characteristics to those that, upon reflection, turn out to be market bottoms heightened by excess pessimism that can be followed by periods of strong growth.” \n\n“The absence of information breeds uncertainty and fear, particularly for the stocks in which we invest,” continued Daniel B. Wolfe, President of 180 Degree Capital. “Tax-loss selling and low liquidity result in significant volatility that is often independent from the reality of the state of these businesses. This is why we, as fundamental investors, get to know management teams, understand markets, and position ourselves to take advantage of market dislocations. We are particularly encouraged by the reports from a number of our largest holdings during this earnings cycle that we believe position them for additional growth and stock price appreciation. We look forward to discussing these updates on our shareholder call and with investors throughout the quarter.”\n\nThe table below summarizes 180’s performance over periods of time through the end of Q3 20241:\n\nQuarter | YTD | 1 Year | 3 Year | 5 Year | Inception to Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nQ3 2024 | Q4 2023- Q3 2024 | Q3 2023- Q3 2024 | Q3 2021- Q3 2024 | Q3 2019- Q3 2024 | Q4 2016- Q3 2024  \nTURN Public Portfolio Gross Total Return (Excluding SMA Carried Interest) | -0.4% | -6.3% | 0.2% | -42.4% | -10.7% | 165.1%  \nTURN Public Portfolio Gross Total Return (Including SMA Carried Interest) | -0.4% | -6.3% | 0.2% | -40.9% | -4.7% | 182.5%  \nChange in NAV | -2.2% | -12.4% | -10.4% | -57.6% | -51.9% | -37.3%  \nChange in Stock Price | -11.0% | -17.7% | -20.4% | -53.5% | -47.4% | -18.5%  \nRussell Microcap Index | 8.3% | 7.4% | 24.7% | -10.9% | 49.8% | 59.2%  \nRussell Microcap Growth Index | 8.6% | 6.9% | 23.6% | -27.2% | 31.5% | 37.4%  \nRussell Microcap Value Index | 8.2% | 5.2% | 22.8% | 0.1% | 58.1% | 70.5%  \nRussell 2000 Index | 9.3% | 11.2% | 26.7% | 5.5% | 56.4% | 82.1%  \n  \nMr. Rendino and Mr. Wolfe will host a conference call tomorrow, Friday, November 15, 2024, at 9am Eastern Time, to discuss the results from Q3 2024 and developments to date during Q4 2024.

          "content": "Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter\nFellow Shareholders:\nWe have spoken enough of just how difficult this environment has been for small cap stocks relative\nto large caps, especially the largest of the large. The bear market for our asset class has lasted far\nlonger and driven valuations down far further than I ever would have thought possible. We think this\nphenomenon may finally be reversing following the Fed move to cut rates starting in mid-September\nand the removal of uncertainty around the outcome of the US election. One near-term indicator for\nthis transition is that since these events, the Russell Microcap Index has doubled the performance\nof the SPX 500. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity going forward for small\ncapitalization stocks, particularly given the backdrop of their historically low valuations in general\nand relative to large capitalization stocks. I have seen this play out time and time again during my\n35+ years of experience through these types of investment cycles. While it is always possible this\ntime is different, recent market trends have similar characteristics to those that, upon reflection,\nturn out to be market bottoms. Excessive pessimism is usually followed by periods of strong growth.\nFor this quarter’s letter, I could go on and on about the market, but I have discussed these points ad\nnauseum in prior letters and white papers. I’ve also gone through our constructive activism and how\nthe catalysts we identified, we believe, could lead to material appreciation in our portfolio holdings\nin those prior letters and papers. Rather than go through each of these holdings in this letter, I’d\nrather spend the time being retrospective about what we took over and what we did to remake the\nbusiness, and, with the lens of an activist, be introspective on what questions should we be asking\nand answering now, to put 180 Degree Capital in the best position for value creation for its\nshareholders.\nGiven it has been over 7 years since Daniel and I took over the predecessor of 180 Degree Capital,\nwhich was known as Harris & Harris Group, some of our shareholders may not be fully aware of the\nhistory that led to us running the firm. After I left BlackRock in 2012, I decided to start a friends-and-\nfamily fund focused on small cap activism using my value-based investing approach. In 2016, I was\nnominated by an activist to Harris & Harris’ Board. The existing Board welcomed my addition without\nthe need for a proxy fight because they understood the company was in dire need of a new\ninvestment focus and approach :\n1. Due to a number of secular changes, the business model of venture capital investing coupled\nwith longer periods to exits became a significant mismatch with the expectations of public\nmarket investors who demand more frequent returns and generation of liquidity.\n2. The elongated holding time of investments required the investment of substantially more\ncapital in such investments than historically was required for such private companies.\n3. Venture capital investments are non-income producing and getting access to such invested\ncapital is difficult to impossible at reasonable valuations outside of a whole-company\nsolution such as an initial public offering or sale.\n4. Without the ability to predictably generate returns on investment and the inability to raise\nadditional capital due to the entity trading below NAV, Harris & Harris Group ran the risk of\ninsolvency due to ongoing operating expenses.\nI will be forever proud that Daniel and I, along with the Board, embraced change when we did, as the\nalternative for our shareholders would likely have ended poorly. The first 5 years of 180 Degree\nCapital were sensational for all our shareholders. The last 3 years have been more than frustrating.\nSo, with 180 Degree Capital’s stock having retraced our gains, the current price sits at a place where\nI ask, as an activist, is there something for us to do differently than we are doing currently. We like to\n“walk the walk,” so let’s walk through some of the questions we typically ask when assessing\npotential activism within our portfolio holdings or companies we are looking at, and then provide our\nanswers to these questions with regard to 180 Degree Capital:\n1. Does the company have the right strategy?\nPrior to the inception of 180 Degree Capital and its investment strategy, the answer was no.\nToday, I firmly believe the answer is yes. As I said above, I’ve been a public market investor\nfor 35 years. I know that there are periods of performance where you look like a genius, and\nthere are periods where you where you look (and feel) the complete opposite. I have gone\nthrough both, and that’s the business. If I had a dollar every time someone tried to convince\nme to change my process at the bottom, I’d be a billionaire. I never have succumbed to such\nadvice, and I never will. That said, I learn from mistakes and endeavor to not repeat them, I\nuse additional information to try and make better decisions, and I adjust my thought\nprocesses to reflect the reality of today and any trends that may impact tomorrow.\nLet’s just look at the facts. During the first five years of 180 Degree Capital, we crushed it.\nThe last 3 we haven't. Unfortunately, it happens. We’re focused on taking steps that will lead\nto a return to positive performance. We continue to believe that the universe of small\ncapitalization public companies is the right place to be investing for 180 Degree Capital.\nThese companies are often in desperate need of help from constructive activists, such as us,\nto help unlock value through the types of things we have done historically. In particular, we\nbelieve this next upcoming investment cycle will present the need for creative capital\nstructure solutions to address upcoming debt maturities, remove preferred stock overhangs,\nprovide acquisition financing, and expand access to growth capital. Ideally these solutions\ncan come from partners that have strong relationships with management teams, and we are\npositioning 180 Degree Capital to be this partner.\nThe bottom line is that we need our holdings to do well, our activism to result in good\noutcomes, and the public markets to reward such results. While these outcomes can take\ntime, and the path is rarely along a straight line, these timeframes are much more aligned\nwith the expectations of public market investors than those of investing in early-stage,\nprivate companies.\n2. Is there going-out-of business risk if the strategy takes too long to implement?\nHarris & Harris Group was headed toward insolvency if it kept operating under the same\nstrategy. With the benefit of hindsight, we are now even more certain of this outcome given\nthe poor returns from the legacy private portfolio. This risk does not exist for 180 Degree\nCapital because we successfully transitioned its balance sheet to cash and publicly traded\nsecurities. This composition of our balance sheet along with permanent capital enables us\nto be focused on building value through our investments and activism rather than worrying\nabout whether the entity survive through episodic and cyclical downturns as we have\nexperienced during the past three years.\n3. Does the company have the right operating model and expense structure?\nWhen Daniel and I took over 180 Degree Capital, we reduced our operating expenses\novernight from $6.5 million to approximately $3 million. We moved from 8,000 sq. ft. of space\nin Midtown Manhattan that previously cost over $350,000 per year to a small office space\nthat costs less than $40,000 per year. We went from two administrative assistants to zero.\nWe use freeconferencecall.com to host our shareholder calls at zero cost. We changed the\nregulatory structure of the firm from a business development company to a closed-end\nmanagement investment company because it allowed us to substantially reduce our\nauditing and compliance-related costs. We did this, even though doing so disadvantaged\nmanagement by eliminating the ability to issue stock as compensation to management and\nthe Board.\nWe look for and take advantage of opportunities to reduce costs wherever we can. The costs\nwe do have are those required for us to operate as a public company and for the\ncompensation of our three full-time and one part-time employees. We have not paid\nperformance bonuses to the management team for the prior two years, as our results did not\nmeet our expectations of value creation for stockholders.\n4. Are all interests aligned with shareholders, and have management and the Board\ndemonstrated this alignment through open-market purchases?\nThe interests of the management and the Board are very much aligned with our shareholders,\nparticularly since we collectively own 12.7% of 180 Degree Capital, with Daniel and I owning\n2.5% and 7.9%, respectively of this amount. I am the largest stockholder of 180 Degree\nCapital. Daniel is the fifth largest. It is important to remember that neither management nor\nour Board receive compensation in stock as mentioned above. Substantially all of our\nownership was purchased in open-market transactions at significantly higher prices than\nwhere 180 Degree Capital’s stock trades at today. If that is not being fully aligned with\nstockholders, I am not sure what is. We have significant “skin in the game” and have endured\nthe same pain as all of our shareholders due to pressure on our stock price.\nAdditionally, since the inception of 180 Degree Capital, members of management and/or our\nBoard have purchased common stock in the open market in every quarter except one, the\nprior quarter. You might ask, why were there no purchases during the prior quarter? As is the\nsame for all public companies, it could be one of two reasons: 1) neither management or the\nBoard desired to purchase additional stock, or 2) management and the Board were not\npermitted to purchase stock because of regulatory restrictions, such as possessing material\nnon-public information outside of blackout periods. I’ll leave it to you to determine which\nyou think is the reason.\nAt the end of the day, 180 Degree Capital’s management and Board are focused on the careful\nassessment of what will give the 180 Degree Capital the best chance to succeed for its shareholders\ngoing forward. We are doing everything we expect our investee companies to be doing. We “walk\nthe walk,” and follow proper procedures and corporate governance along the way. We do not have\nour head in the sand thinking that growth and value creation will solely come from returns on our\nexisting investments. We are always evaluating strategic options to increase our assets and\ncapabilities to take advantage of opportunities to build value and the overall scale of our business.\nWe appreciate that our largest and longest shareholders have expressed their support for these\nefforts and understanding that this progress does not happen overnight. We look forward to\ndiscussing these efforts with all of our shareholders as is appropriate and permitted. In the\nmeantime, we continue to execute on our investment strategy. The slides below provide an update\non our holdings and what we are doing to constructively advocate for value creation at those\ncompanies and, as a result, for 180 Degree Capital shareholders that we will discuss in additional\ndetail on our upcoming shareholder call:\nAs always, thank you for your support.\nBest Regards,\nKevin M.

          "content": "Q4 2023\nAnnual Report\n1\n[THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK]\n2\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter\nFellow Shareholders:\nThis “recession,\" which has been one of the drivers of capital away from risk assets to perceived safer assets, has been the most\nfun and awesome one ever. Persistent predictions of a return to arguably more normal interest rates have not led to an\neconomic calamity. Instead, GDP rose 3.1%, wages and salaries grew 4.7%, real private fixed investment in manufacturing\nstructures reached all-time highs and employment remains strong. I didn’t live through the 1929 recession, but I did experience\nthe near depression in 2008, and 2023 seemed eerily similar to those years…. NOT!\nDespite strong macroeconomic trends in 2023, somehow a basket of microcap companies that comprise the Russell Microcap\nIndex underperformed the NASDAQ 100 by over 4600 basis points! In our last shareholder letter, we incorporated a plethora of\ncharts showing that microcap companies are historically inexpensive and undervalued relative to larger-sized companies.\nWhile substantially all of those data and charts remain applicable today, I’m not going to regurgitate what was in that letter that\nyou can find at https://ir.180degreecapital.com/financial-results. Instead, I’ll note commentary regarding Q4 2023 from Royce\nInvestment Partners, who we hold in high regard:\nValuations for Small-Cap Are Highly Attractive vs. Large-Cap\nWe think it bears repeating that, even with a terrific 4Q23 and a positive return in 2023, the Russell 2000 finished the\nyear well shy of its 11/8/21 peak—while large-caps continued to establish new highs in 4Q23. In fact, it’s been 563\ndays since the current cycle low for the Russell 2000—the third longest span without recovering the prior peak on\nrecord.\nFallout from the Internet Bubble saw small-caps need 456 days from their trough to match their previous peak, while\nit took 704 days for small-caps to recover their prior peak following their trough in the 2008-09 Financial Crisis.\nEach of these periods saw dramatic developments: the implosion of high-flying technology stocks in 2000-02 and a\nglobal financial catastrophe in 2008-09. The current period has seen ample uncertainty, and a record pace of interest\nrate increases yet lacks the existential threats that characterized the Internet Bubble and, even more so, the Financial\nCrisis. The latter period also saw less bifurcation between small- and large-cap returns. Yet based on our preferred\nindex valuation metric of enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes, or EV/EBIT, the Russell 2000 finished\n2023 not far from its 25-year low relative to the Russell 1000.\nRussell 2000 vs. Russell 1000 Median LTM EV/EBIT¹ (ex. Negative EBIT Companies)\n12/31/98-12/31/23\n1Last twelve months Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest and Taxes\nSimilarly, small-cap value continued to sell at a below average valuation relative to small-cap growth at the end of the\nyear, as measured by EV/EBIT. Micro-cap stocks also remained very attractively valued relative to large-cap based on\nEV/EBIT. As small-cap specialists, we see these gaps in valuation and long-term performance as revealing the\nconsiderable long-term opportunities that still exist within the small- and micro-cap asset classes—especially when\nstacked against their large- and mega-cap counterparts.\nHere is one chart we shared in last quarter’s shareholder letter that we thought would be worth updating and showing again.\n3\nEven with the increases in small and microcapitalization stocks in Q4 2023, the IWM/SPY ratio remains at historical lows. We\ncontinue to believe that this ratio says nothing about the fundamentals of the businesses that comprise each index, given those\nfundamentals have held up better for many microcap companies than the index performance would suggest.\nWe think we are at the end of the Fed hiking cycle. We are not in the camp that the Fed will be cutting rates anytime soon,\nbecause we believe the economy will continue to show the resilience that it showed last year. That, in our view, is a positive\nrather than a negative. Our portfolio companies do not require lower rates to execute and build value for shareholders. They\nbenefit from the types of positive economic trends we saw in 2023 and continue to see in the beginning of 2024. And against\nthat backdrop, we expect that many of our holdings which are trading at historically low valuation levels, have a long runway to\nrise in value and help us increase our net asset value per share (“NAV”). Let’s look at a few of our current favorite names.\nPotbelly Corporation (PBPB)\nWe have been investors in PBPB since 2019. PBPB is a fast-casual restaurant chain that sells sandwiches, salads, soups and\nother lunch focused items at company-owned and franchised locations. We have discussed PBPB in detail in prior shareholder\nletters and whitepapers, so we won’t rehash the entire story here aside from saying we believe PBPB has strong brand\nrecognition, high-quality products, a healthy balance sheet and one of the best management teams we have ever invested in.\nPBPB has 425 locations, including 75 franchised in 33 states plus the District of Columbia. Additionally, PBPB recently\nannounced that it has development agreements for almost 200 additional shops.\nFor 2024, we see several potential value-creating catalysts that we believe could push the stock price substantially higher. First,\nthe company has said that it expects to open 40 new franchise stores this coming year, which represents close to 10% growth.\nAdditionally, PBPB is projecting continued growth in average unit volume, shop level margins and adjusted EBITDA margins.\nLastly, management expects material generation of positive cash flows that will enable various options for capital allocation\nincluding repayment of expensive debt, stock buybacks and/or other forms of return of capital.\nInvestors are starting to wake up to PBPB’s momentum entering 2024. Should this momentum continue, we believe that PBPB\nwill command a common franchise-level multiple of enterprise value to EBITDA in the mid-to-high teens from its current low\nteens multiple. This multiple expansion combined with the cash flow and earnings power of the remade business could lead to\nfurther material appreciation in PBPB’s common stock.\nSynchronoss Technologies, Inc. (SNCR)\nSNCR provides white-label technology that enables large corporations to offer customers cloud-based storage of personal data.\nSNCR’s platform powers the personal cloud offerings of a number of Tier 1 companies including Verizon, SoftBank, AT&T,\nAssurant, British Telecom and Tracfone under long term contracts. We first invested in SNCR as part of an underwritten\nfinancing in June of 2021 that allowed SNCR to pay off its punitive preferred stock and recapitalize the company with reduced\ninterest expense, while also providing flexibility going forward to execute on strategic options for the business. The first of\nthese strategic alternatives was completed in Q4 2023 with the sale of SNCR’s non-core messaging and digital businesses.\nSNCR is now a pure-play, cloud-focused business with high margins and is on the cusp of generating significant free cash\nflows.\nOur bullish view for 2024 is centered around a number of catalysts that we believe will improve SNCR’s balance sheet and\ndemonstrate the operating leverage of the business. First, SNCR has stated that it expects to receive approximately $28 million\nfrom a tax refund at some point in 2024. This inflow of capital will allow SNCR to pay down a portion of its relatively\n3\nexpensive outstanding preferred stock and/or debt that matures in June 2026. Second, SNCR is expecting to return to top-line\nrevenue growth after the runoff of historical deferred revenue and continued growth in subscribers at its largest customer,\nVerizon, and its newest customer, Softbank. Third, the end of non-recurring charges related to restructuring and prior litigation\nand corresponding settlements coupled with revenue growth and a material reduction in interest paid on its outstanding debt\nshould lead to material free cash flow generation in 2024 that we believe could grow substantially in 2025. Lastly, we should\nnote that in December 2023 we were asked to join SNCR’s Board of Directors to help with the company’s execution of its next\nphase of growth.\nAs we look at what this might mean for the stock price of SNCR, it ended 2023 at $6.21, which equated to a multiple of\nenterprise value to estimated 2024 EBITDA of approximately 5.6x. This multiple declines to approximately 5.2x if SNCR\nreceives the tax refund and uses it primarily to pay down debt. We do not believe a cloud-focused business with 85-90%\nrecurring revenue, 70-75% gross margins, 25%+ EBITDA margins that also generates positive free cash flow should command\nsuch a low multiple. In our opinion, a more appropriate multiple would be in the double digits. SNCR recently reported the\ncompletion of significant cost savings initiatives along with strong performance in Q4 2023 and the stock responded positively.\nWe believe this is just the start for SNCR and that 2024 will be a turning point for SNCR both in terms of its business and how\ninvestors value SNCR’s common stock.\ncomScore, Inc. (SCOR)\nOur initial investment in SCOR took place in 2021, following its recapitalization by Charter, Cerberus and Liberty Media\n(Qurate). Our original thesis for our investment was centered on multiple factors including our beliefs that: (i) SCOR was a\ncompany with uniquely competitive media measurement offerings and proprietary data; (ii) SCOR’s new investors could help\nwith improved execution, financial performance and overall growth; and (iii) SCOR traded at a significant discount to its peers.\nWhile SCOR’s business has improved dramatically under new management with 33% EBITDA growth over the last two years,\nSCOR’s stock has declined precipitously. We believe this is due to poor corporate governance and uncertainty around SCOR’s\ncapital structure. As a result, we have ramped up our activism significantly through the nomination of Matthew F. McLaughlin\nas a director nominee for consideration at SCOR’s upcoming annual meeting of stockholders. Matt is a retired advertising\ntechnology executive and Naval officer. Most recently, he served as Chief Operating Officer of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc.\n(NYSE: DV) (“DoubleVerify”), a software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, from 2011 to March 2022.\nAs COO of DoubleVerify, Matt directed its Product, Engineering and Sales Operations activity, including managing over half\nthe company’s employees. Given SCOR’s struggles with, and focus on, improving its digital offerings, we could think of\nnobody more useful to the SCOR Board and management than Matt. Matt is available and happy to speak with any SCOR\nstockholder that wishes to speak with him so they can judge for themselves whether he is qualified and should serve on SCOR’s\nBoard. While we are actively preparing to run a competitive proxy campaign to support his candidacy, we hope SCOR’s Board\nwill realize the complementary skill set that we believe he can bring to help build value for all of SCOR’s stakeholders and that\na competitive proxy contest will not be required.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we see a number of potential value-creating catalysts (in addition to our activism) that could lead\nto material appreciation in the stock. These potential catalysts include: (i) SCOR’s preferred stockholders taking steps to\ndemonstrate an alignment of interests across all stakeholders of the company; (ii) SCOR demonstrating the ability to\nconsistently generate double-digit EBITDA margins; and (iii) a return to growth for SCOR’s digital business. Assuming SCOR\ncan continue to generate mid-teens EBITDA in 2024, then its common stock is trading at just 4.7x enterprise value to EBITDA\nand 0.75x enterprise value to revenue; we believe this will ultimately prove to be an attractive entry price. We do not believe\nthat either of these multiples are appropriate for a company with unique data assets that generate positive cash flows. We\nbelieve a more appropriate multiple would be in the double-digit range. We firmly believe that improvements in SCOR’s\ncorporate governance combined with improving financial metrics and the demonstration of alignment of all stakeholders can\nlead to material appreciation in SCOR’s common stock.\nThe Arena Group Holdings, Inc. (AREN)\nWe have been significant shareholders of AREN since June 2019. AREN is a media company that employs a technology\nplatform that allows creators and publishers to publish and monetize content alongside anchor brands including Sports\nIllustrated, TheStreet, Parade, Men’s Journal, and HubPages to build their businesses. AREN’s content is distributed across a\ndiverse portfolio of over 265 brands, reaching over 100 million users monthly. Throughout the history of our investment there\nhave been periods where we engaged in constructive activism that resulted in what we believe were improvements in\nmanagement and corporate governance. The advertising market in 2023 was challenging, but AREN’s business held up better\nthan many other companies.\nIn November 2023, AREN signed a definitive agreement to merge with Bridge Media Networks, LLC (“Bridge Media”), a\nmedia group that includes a portfolio of over-the-air television stations, national television networks, streaming platforms and\nwebsites for delivering news, sports, automotive and travel content. Bridge Media is a wholly owned subsidiary of Simplify\nInventions, LLC, which is owned by Manoj Bhargava, the founder of 5-hour Energy®. Under the terms of the merger, entities\nassociated with Mr. Bhargava will invest $50 million in the combined entity and the consumer brands owned by Mr. Bhargava\nwill commit to approximately $60 million in guaranteed advertising revenue for AREN. Subsequent to the signing of this\ndefinitive agreement, Mr. Bhargava purchased the debt and equity of AREN owned by B. Riley and then invested an additional\n$12 million for working capital purposes while the company seeks the required shareholder and regulatory approvals to\ncomplete the merger.\n4\nWhile the start of 2024 has presented additional challenges for AREN, Mr. Bhargava has a history of building significant value\nacross multiple industries. We have had opportunities to speak with both Mr. Bhargava and the new CEO of AREN, Cavitt\nRandall, and appreciate their candor and desire to build a sustainable business that grows profitably. AREN was the largest\nsource of declines in our portfolio in 2023. We look forward to the completion of the merger in 2024 and to what we believe\ncan be significant value creation under new management led by Mr. Bhargava and Mr. Randall.\nConclusion\nI have been managing money for over 30 years and have been an investor or portfolio manager since 1988. Never in my life\nhave I been more convinced that we own a collection of companies that I believe have the potential to rise materially in value as\nmuch as the portfolio TURN has put together as we start 2024. We are also at a point where I believe our constructive activism\nwill make a difference in this value creation. While the last 2 years have been incredibly frustrating and disappointing, I have\nhad the 30+ year experience of knowing that challenging performance periods happen. During these periods, it is crucial that\nyou don’t shy away from talking about them, you don’t become over-emotional about them, and you stick to your knitting and\nprocess no matter how painful the period can be. My dear friend Phil Appel, who I believe to be one of Merrill Lynch’s best\nfinancial advisors and one of the smartest people I have ever met (also a heck of a driver of the golf ball, though not a great\nputter) sent me a quote years ago that I hold near and dear to my heart:\n“The one willing to look stupidest the longest wins.”\nWe feel stupid on the one hand, yet on the other, we couldn’t be more optimistic about what we own and convinced significant\nvalue appreciation is possible in the next few years.\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 was the start of what we believe will be a return to risk asset classes, including the\nmicrocapitalization stocks in which we invest. Our +6.9% gross total return in our public portfolio was the primary contributor\nto the growth of our NAV per share from $4.91 to $5.02. Our assets on our balance sheet are now almost 100% comprised of\ninvestments in public companies and cash. Please see slides that we have posted on our website at https://\nir.180degreecapital.com/financial-results for details of the sources of change in our portfolio during Q4 2023, the full year and\ninception to date. On the macroeconomic front, the resilience of the US economy combined with the apparent end of the Fed’s\ntightening cycle and likely future reductions in interest rates should be one tailwind for our investments in general in 2024. For\n180, we believe 2024 will be a year defined by our constructive activism and by long-awaited catalysts at certain of our\nportfolio companies that together could lead to material value creation for 180 Degree Capital’s stockholders.\n180 Degree Capital’s constructive activism means working with management teams and/or boards of directors of our portfolio\ncompanies to build value for all stakeholders in those businesses. We do not have the hubris to believe we know the businesses\nof our investee companies better than their management teams and boards. We do have complementary skill sets and contacts\nthat can help unlock stunted value. We believe this complementarity is what led to the invitation to join the Board of Directors\nof SNCR. We have rolled up our sleeves to help SNCR’s management and board wherever possible and could not be more\nexcited about the opportunity for value creation that we believe exists for SNCR. It is unfortunate that the Board of Directors\nof SCOR does not have the same openness and humility to understand they do not have all the answers in regard to fixing the\ndestruction of value that has occurred under their watch. We believe our nominee, Matt McLaughlin, has both relevant industry\nexperience for where SCOR is heading with its business and can be an advocate for proper corporate governance, particularly\nfor common stockholders, as a significant common stockholder himself. We believe our constructive activism is not only a\ndifferentiated investment approach, but also can be an important part of the ultimate unlocking of value for our portfolio\nholdings and creation of value for 180 Degree Capital’s stockholders.\nAs we noted in a press release on February 1, 2024, the discount of our NAV to our stock price was approximately 26% as of\nthe end of January 2024. This discount equates to a NAV as of the end of January 2024 that was approximately 8% higher than\nat the end of 2023. We established the Discount Management Program to make it clear that TURN’s management and Board\nare serious about our intentions to narrow this discount. We collectively own almost 12% of outstanding shares, and this\nownership continues to grow solely through open market purchases. We are laser-focused on creating value for all stockholders\nof TURN through growth of our NAV and the narrowing of the discount.\nAs always, thank you for your support.\nBest Regards,\nKevin Rendino\nChief Executive Officer\nForward-Looking Statements and Disclaimers\nThis shareholder letter may contain statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Portfolio Investment Valuation.\n(2) Investments in unaffiliated securities consist of investments in which the Company owns less than five percent of the\nvoting shares of the portfolio company. Investments in non-controlled affiliated securities consist of investments in\nwhich the Company owns five percent or more, but less than 25 percent, of the voting shares of the portfolio company,\nor where the Company controls one or more seats on the portfolio company’s board of directors but do not control the\ncompany. Investments in controlled affiliated securities consist of investments in which the Company owns 25 percent\nor more of the outstanding voting rights of the portfolio company or otherwise control the company, including control\nof a majority of the seats on the board of directors, or more than 25 percent of the seats on the board of directors, with\nno other entity or person in control of more director seats than us.\n(3) Represents a non-income producing investment. Investments that have not paid dividends or interest within the last 12\nmonths or are on non-accrual status for at least 12 consecutive months are considered to be non-income producing.\n(4) D-Wave Quantum Inc., (\"QBTS\") was formed through the merger of D-Wave Systems, Inc., and DPCM Capital, Inc.,\na special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). D-Wave Systems, Inc. was a legacy private portfolio holding of the\nCompany. The Company initially invested in D-Wave Systems, Inc. starting in 2008 and through 2014, acquiring\nvarious classes of preferred stock. While the shares of QBTS owned by the Company are registered, the Company\nentered into a lockup agreement with QBTS that prevented the Company from trading or hedging these shares until\nFebruary 5, 2023. As of that date, the Company's shares of common stock of QBTS are no longer subject to lockup\nrestrictions.\n(5) The Company is subject to legal restrictions on the sale of all or a portion of our investment(s) in this company. The\ntotal amount of restricted securities held is $1,854,086, or 3.7 percent of net assets.\n(6) The Company received LLC Interests of 1.25 percent in AutoTech Ventures Management I, LLC (\"AutoTech\")\npursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement between us and AutoTech and due to us following the termination\nof a former employee of the Company. These LLC Interests were separate from the compensation received for\nproviding the administrative services under the agreement that were paid in cash. The LLC interests have a capital\npercentage of 0 percent.\n(7) These securities are held by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, 180 Degree Private Holdings, LLC (\"180PH\"),\nwhich were transferred from the Company to 180PH in the fourth quarter of 2020. The acquisition dates of the\nsecurities reflect the dates such securities were obtained by the Company rather than the transfer date.\n(8) Represents a non-operating entity that exists to collect future payments from licenses or other engagements, monetize\nassets for future distributions to investors and debt holders, or is in the process of shutting down and distributing\nremaining assets according to a liquidation waterfall.\n(9) The Company received shares of Ravenna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as part of the consideration of the acquisition of Petra\nPharma Corporation.\n(10) The Company is the Investment Manager of separately managed accounts (\"SMAs\") that owns shares of these\nportfolio companies. Under our investment management agreement for the SMAs, the Company has the right to\ncontrol the votes of the securities held by the SMAs. The Company has voting ownership between 5 percent and 25\npercent in these companies when the shares held by us and our SMAs are aggregated.\n(11) These stock options were granted to Kevin Rendino upon his appointment to the Board of Directors of Synchronoss\nTechnologies, Inc. Mr. Rendino entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with the Company that\ntransfers all beneficial and voting interest to the Company.\n(12) Other financial instruments are holdings of the Company that do not meet the definition of a security or a derivative.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n20\n180 DEGREE CAPITAL CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n(13) If all the remaining milestones are met and the time-based payments are completed, the Company would receive\napproximately $4.0 million. Of this amount, approximately $1.3 million is due to be paid to the Company on April 1,\n2024. There can be no assurance as to how much of the remaining approximately $2.7 million in potential milestone-\nbased payments will ultimately be realized or when they will be realized, if at all.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n21\n180 DEGREE CAPITAL CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. THE COMPANY\n180 Degree Capital Corp. (including its wholly owned subsidiaries, the \"Company,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and \"we\"), withdrew\nits election to be treated as a business development company on March 30, 2017, and subsequently returned to its prior status as\na registered non-diversified closed-end management investment company (\"Closed-End Fund\" or \"CEF\") under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"). We operate as an internally managed investment company whereby our officers and\nemployees, under the general supervision of our Board of Directors, conduct our operations. As of May 22, 2020, we are also\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a Registered Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisers\nAct of 1940 (the \"Advisers Act\").\n180 Degree Private Holdings, LLC (\"180PH\"), is a wholly owned limited liability company that was created in\nOctober 2020 to hold certain of the Company's securities of privately held companies. 180PH was consolidated for financial\nreporting purposes and is a disregarded entity for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\").\n180 Degree Capital BD, LLC (\"180BD\") was a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the Company that was sold to an\nunrelated buyer and the transaction closed in February 2023. 180BD was registered by the Company as a broker-dealer with the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") that was formed to provide services to the Company related to fundraising\nfor co-investment funds and not for investment returns. Historically, the Company consolidated 180BD for financial reporting\npurposes.\nThe Company is the Managing Member of 180 Degree Capital Management, LLC (\"180CM\"), a limited liability\ncompany formed to facilitate the opportunity for interested investors to co-invest alongside the Company in individual publicly\ntraded portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has no capital under management in 180CM.\nThe Company was the General Partner of 180 Phoenix Fund, L.P., (\"180 Phoenix\") a limited partnership formed to\nfacilitate the opportunity to manage capital for investors in a traditional limited partnership structure. The Company did not\nraise capital into 180 Phoenix. Based on conversations with potential investors that indicated more interest in management of\nseparate accounts rather than a limited partnership structure, in December 2023, the Company elected to file a certificate of\ncancellation to terminate the existence of the entity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company manages approximately $10.6 million in net assets in two separately managed\naccounts (\"SMA\").\nThe Company may, in certain cases, receive management fees and carried interest on profits generated on invested\ncapital from any capital under management if and when capital is raised and if and when profits are realized, respectively. The\nCompany does not consolidate the operations of any capital managed in separate series of 180CM, or in the separately managed\naccounts.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial\nstatements:\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the US (\"GAAP\") and Articles 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange\nCommission (\"SEC\") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company is an\ninvestment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 946. In accordance\nwith GAAP and Regulation S-X under 17 C.F.R. Part 210, the Company may only consolidate its interests in investment\ncompany subsidiaries and controlled operating companies whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Prior\nto February 2023, our wholly owned subsidiary, 180BD, was a controlled operating company that provided services to us and\nwas, therefore, consolidated. 180PH is a controlled operating company that provide services to us and is, therefore,\nconsolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions were eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n22\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, \"Consolidation”, provides guidance on the consolidation of\nfinancial statements when a company has control over another entity. ASC 810-10-40 addresses the accounting for the\ndeconsolidation of a subsidiary and outlines the criteria for determining when to deconsolidate a subsidiary. The Company\nderecognized 180BD as the Company ceased to have a controlling financial interest of 180BD as of February 2023, following\nthe sale of its equity of 180BD to an unrelated third party. The Company recognized $100,000 in net realized gain on the\ndeconsolidation.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets\nand liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and the\ndifferences could be material. The most significant estimates relate to the fair valuations of our investments.\nPortfolio Investment Valuations. Investments are stated at \"value\" as defined in the 1940 Act and in the applicable\nregulations of the SEC and in accordance with GAAP. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market\nprice for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) the fair value as determined in good faith by,\nor under the direction of, the Board of Directors for all other assets. The Valuation Committee, comprised of all of the\nindependent Board members, is responsible for determining the valuation of the Company’s assets within the guidelines\nestablished by the Board of Directors, pursuant with SEC Rule 2a-5. The Valuation Committee receives information and\nrecommendations from management. The Company may from time to time use an independent valuation firm to review select\nportfolio company valuations on an as needed basis. The independent valuation firm, when engaged by the Company, does not\nprovide independent valuations. The fair values assigned to these investments are based on available information and do not\nnecessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized when that investment is sold, as such amounts depend on future\ncircumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily\nmarketable. The Valuation Committee values the Company's investment assets as of the end of each calendar quarter and as of\nany other time requested by the Board of Directors.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" (\"ASC 820\") defines fair value as the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date (exit price). It applies fair value terminology to all valuations whereas the 1940 Act applies market value\nterminology to readily marketable assets and fair value terminology to other assets.\nThe main approaches to measuring fair value utilized are the market approach, the income approach and the hybrid\napproach.\n• Market Approach (M): The market approach focuses on inputs and not techniques. The market approach may use\nquantitative inputs such as prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving\nidentical or comparable assets or liabilities and the values of market multiples derived from a set of comparable\ncompanies. The market approach may also use qualitative inputs such as progress toward milestones, the long-\nterm potential of the business, current and future financing requirements and the rights and preferences of certain\nsecurities versus those of other securities. The selection of the relevant inputs used to derive value under the\nmarket approach requires judgment considering factors specific to the significance and relevance of each input to\nderiving value.\n• Income Approach (I): The income approach focuses on techniques and not inputs. The income approach uses\nvaluation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, revenue, cash flows or earnings) to a single present\nvalue amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations\nabout those future amounts. Those valuation techniques include present value techniques; option-pricing models,\nsuch as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula (a closed-form model) and a binomial model (a lattice model), which\nincorporate present value techniques; and the multi-period excess earnings method, which is used to measure the\nfair value of certain assets.\n• Hybrid Approach (H): The hybrid approach uses elements of both the market approach and the income approach.\nThe hybrid approach calculates values using the market and income approach, individually. The resulting values\nare then distributed among the share classes based on probability of exit outcomes.\nASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value by these approaches into the following hierarchy:\n• Level 1 (L1): Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n23\n• Level 2 (L2): Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted\nprices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the\nfinancial instrument. Level 2 inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions, the prices are not\ncurrent, little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered\nmarket makers; and\n• Level 3 (L3): Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nUnobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect our own assumptions that market participants would use to price\nthe asset or liability based upon the best available information.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement and are not necessarily an indication of risks associated with the investment.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our financial statements include investments fair valued by the Board of Directors of\n$2,321,571. The fair values were determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors. The fair value\namount includes the values of our investments in legacy privately held companies and rights to future milestone payments, as\nwell as our warrants of Potbelly Corporation and Magnolia Neurosciences Corporation, and our stock options for common\nstock of Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.\nCash. Cash includes demand deposits. Cash is carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\nUnaffiliated Rights to Payments. At December 31, 2023, the outstanding potential milestone and time-based payments\nfrom the acquisition of TARA Biosystems, Inc., by Valo Health, LLC were valued at $1,356,391. The milestone payments are\nvalued using the probability-adjusted, present value of proceeds from future payments that would be due upon successful\ncompletion of certain regulatory milestones. There can be no assurance as to how much of the amounts related to milestone\npayments that we will ultimately realize or when they will be realized, if at all. The time-based payments are valued using a\ndiscount for time-value of money that includes estimated default risk of the acquirer.\nPrepaid Expenses. We include prepaid insurance premiums in \"Prepaid expenses.\" Prepaid insurance premiums are\nrecognized over the term of the insurance contract and are included in \"Insurance\" in the Company's Consolidated Statement of\nOperations.\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are included in \"Other assets\" and are carried at $9,799 at\nDecember 31, 2023, representing cost of $229,818, less accumulated depreciation of $220,019. Depreciation is provided using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment. We estimate the useful lives to be five\nto ten years for furniture and fixtures, and three years for computer equipment.\nPost-Retirement Plan Liabilities. Until it was terminated on April 27, 2017, the Company provided a Retiree Medical\nBenefit Plan for employees who met certain eligibility requirements. Until it was terminated on May 5, 2011, the Company\nalso provided an Executive Mandatory Retirement Benefit Plan for certain individuals employed by us in a bona fide executive\nor high policy-making position. The net periodic post-retirement benefit cost includes service cost and interest cost on the\naccumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized as net periodic benefit\ncost, pursuant to the Company's historical accounting policy in \"Salaries, bonus and benefits\" in the Company's Consolidated\nStatement of Operations. The impact of plan amendments was amortized over the employee's average service period as a\nreduction of net periodic benefit cost. Unamortized prior service cost was fully amortized during 2017 as a result of the\ntermination of the Retiree Medical Benefit Plan.\nInterest Income Recognition. Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is\nrecorded on an accrual basis. When accrued interest is determined not to be recoverable, the Company ceases accruing interest\nand writes off any previously accrued interest. Write-offs are netted in interest income. Securities are deemed to be non-\nincome producing if investments have not paid dividends or interest within the last 12 months or are on non-accrual status for at\nleast 12 consecutive months. When the fair value of a security that includes PIK interest is less than the accrued interest, the\nCompany may place the security on non-accrued status.\nBoard Fees From Portfolio Companies. The Company recognizes revenues from fee income from board fees as those\nservices are provided.\n24\nManagement Fees and Performance Fees/Carried Interest from Managed Funds. As a Registered Investment Adviser\nunder the Advisers Act, the Company may be entitled to receive management fees and performance fees from clients including\nseparately managed accounts (SMAs) and special purpose vehicles (SPVs). When applicable, the Company accrues\nmanagement fees on SPVs that are to be paid upon liquidation of the entity regardless of performance. Performance fees or\ncarried interest, if any, is paid annually by SMAs based on a fixed percentage of the increase in net assets during the year.\nPerformance fees on SPVs, if any, are generally paid based on the amount of increase in net assets at the time of any\ndistribution of capital above the amount of initial invested capital plus accrued expenses. The timing and payment terms of\nmanagement fees and performance fees for future client accounts may be different than those of our current SMAs.\nThe Company does not include accruals for carried interest in the consolidated financial statements until such carried\ninterest is received and/or the Company concludes that it is probable that a reversal of any accrual will not occur. The\nCompany did not earn or accrue any carried interest in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther Income. The Company may purchase restricted securities issued by publicly traded companies that include\nprovisions that provide for payment of partial liquidated damages in the event the issuer does not meet obligations specified in\nthe purchase agreement or other ancillary documents associated with the transaction. These obligations most commonly are\nassociated with the filing of registration statements and/or being up to date with the filing of the issuer's financial statements\nwith the SEC.\nPut and Call Options. The Company may purchase options on publicly traded securities as an investment and/or with\nthe intention of limiting its downside risk. When the Company purchases an option, an amount equal to the premium paid is\nrecorded in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an investment. The Company may also purchase an option\nat one price and write/sell an option at another price in a simultaneous transaction referred to as a spread. The amount of these\nassets is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the options. In the event that the options are exercised,\nthe Company would be required to deliver those shares to the counterparty. When the options expire unexercised, the Company\nrealizes a loss on the premium paid, or the difference between the premium paid and the premium received, as applicable.\nRent Expense. The Company currently leases and runs daily operations in approximately 1,250 square feet of office\nspace in Montclair, New Jersey. Prior to November 17, 2021, the Company leased this space on a month-to-month basis at a\nbase rent of approximately $26 per square foot per year. On November 17, 2021, the Company entered into a three-year lease\nextension that set the average base rent beginning January 1, 2022, at approximately $30 per square foot over the term of the\nextension. Either the Company or the landlord may terminate the lease at any time with two months' written notice to either\nparty. As of December 31, 2023, the present value of the future lease payments (lease liability) is recorded as an asset and a\nliability in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The amount is calculated using weighted average\ndiscount rate of 1.32 percent and weighted based on the terms of the the lease agreement. As of December 31, 2023, the\nremaining commitment on the lease is less than $40,000.\nRealized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Portfolio Investments. Realized gain or loss is\nrecognized when an investment is disposed of and is computed as the difference between the Company's cost basis in the\ninvestment at the disposition date and the net proceeds received from such disposition. Realized gain or loss on investment\ntransactions are determined by specific identification. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation is computed as the difference\nbetween the fair value of the investment and the cost basis of such investment.\nIncome Taxes. As discussed in Note 9. Income Taxes, the Company did not qualify as a regulated investment company\n(\"RIC\") under Subchapter M of the Code in 2023, and will therefore be taxed as a C-Corporation in 2023. The Company did\nnot accrue for any income taxes as of December 31, 2023 as it did not generate ordinary income. The Company has capital loss\ncarryforwards that can be used to offset net realized capital gains. The Company also has operating loss carryforwards that can\nbe used to offset operating income and net realized capital gains in years when it fails to qualify as a RIC. The Company\nrecognizes interest and penalties in income tax expense. See Note 9. Income Taxes for further discussion.\nForeign Currency Translation. The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. All assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of such currencies\nagainst U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. If Company has assets denominated in foreign currencies, it does not isolate the\nportion of the results of operations that arises from changes in foreign currency rates on investments held on its Consolidated\nStatement of Operations.\n25\nSecurities Transactions. Securities transactions are accounted for on the date the transaction for the purchase or sale of\nthe securities is entered into by the Company (i.e., trade date). Securities transactions outside conventional channels, such as\nprivate transactions, are recorded as of the date the Company obtains the right to demand the securities purchased or to collect\nthe proceeds from a sale and incurs the obligation to pay for the securities purchased or to deliver the securities sold.\nConcentration of Credit Risk. The Company places its cash with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in\ndepository accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insured limit and is subject to the credit risk of\nsuch institutions to the extent it exceeds such limit.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Adoptions. On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\". This ASU\nrequires additional disaggregation of the reconciliation between the statutory and effective tax rate for an entity and of income\ntaxes paid, both of which are disclosures required by current GAAP. The amendments improve the transparency of income tax\ndisclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2)\nincome taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within\nthose fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the Company does not have tax liabilities in foreign\njurisdictions.\nOn October 9, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, \"Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in\nResponse to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative.\" This ASU amends the disclosure or presentation\nrequirements related to various subtopics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”). This ASU was\nissued in response to the SEC’s August 2018 Final Rule 2 that updated and simplified disclosure requirements that the SEC\nbelieved were “redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded.” The effective date for each amendment will be\nthe date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes\neffective, with early adoption prohibited. The new guidance is intended to align GAAP requirements with those of the SEC and\nto facilitate the application of GAAP for all entities. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3. BUSINESS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nOur business activities contain elements of risk. We consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk,\ndiversification risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Although we are risk-seeking rather than risk-averse in our\ninvestments, we consider the management of risk to be essential to our business.\nInvestment Objective\nOur investment objective is to generate capital appreciation and current income from investments and investment-\nrelated activities such as managed funds and accounts.\nInvestment Strategy\nOur investment strategy on future new investments is focused on generating capital appreciation and current income\nfrom investments in what we believe are deeply undervalued, small publicly traded companies where we believe we can\npositively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism. Historically, our investment strategy was to achieve\nlong-term capital appreciation investing in venture capital investments. While we continue to provide such resources to our\nexisting legacy portfolio companies, we no longer make venture capital investments. We classify our legacy portfolio\ncompanies as Legacy Privately Held Equity and Equity-Related Securities.\nWe believe we combine new perspectives with the historical knowledge and experience of managing the current\nportfolio. Our investment approach is comprised of a patient examination of available opportunities through due diligence and\nclose involvement with management of our portfolio companies. We invest our capital directly into portfolio companies or\nthrough purchases of securities of publicly traded companies directly and through open-market purchases. We may seek to\ninvest our capital alongside capital from other investors through that we control.\nWe have discretion in the investment of our capital to achieve our objectives by investing in various types of assets,\nand we do not currently limit our investments to any security type. Our investments may include, among other asset types:\nequity, equity-related securities (including warrants and options) and debt with equity features from either private or public\n26\nissuers; debt obligations of all types having varying terms with respect to security or credit support, subordination, purchase\nprice, interest payments and maturity; foreign securities; and miscellaneous investments.\nInvestment Policies\nFundamental policies may not be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of our voting securities, as\ndefined in the 1940 Act. As a matter of fundamental policy, the Company will not:\n(1) Issue senior securities, borrow money from banks, brokers or other lenders, or engage in transactions involving the\nissuance by us of \"senior securities\" representing indebtedness, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act or the rules,\nregulations or interpretations thereof.\n(2) Underwrite securities of other issuers, except insofar as we may be deemed an underwriter under the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), in connection with the disposition of our portfolio securities. We may invest in\nrestricted securities (those that must be registered under the Securities Act before they may be offered or sold to the public) to\nthe extent permitted by the 1940 Act or the rules, regulations or interpretations thereof.\n(3) Invest more than 25% of our total assets in the securities of companies or entities engaged in any one industry, or\ngroup of industries. This limitation does not apply to investment in the securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies or\ninstrumentalities.\n(4) Purchase or sell real estate or interests in real estate (except that we may (a) purchase and sell real estate or\ninterests in real estate in connection with the orderly liquidation of investments, or in connection with foreclosure on collateral,\nor (b) own the securities of companies that are in the business of buying, selling or developing real estate).\n(5) Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, but we may purchase and sell foreign currency and enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts, and may engage in other transactions in financial instruments, in each case to the extent\npermitted under the Company's investment policies as in effect from time to time.\n(6) Make loans of money or securities to other persons, except through purchasing fixed-income securities or other\ndebt instruments, lending portfolio securities or entering into repurchase agreements in a manner consistent with our investment\npolicies. With respect to these investment restrictions, if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of entering into the\ninvestment or transaction, a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or the value of our\ntotal assets, unless otherwise stated or required by law, will not constitute a violation of the restriction or policy.\nValuation Risk\nWe historically invested in privately held companies, the securities of which are inherently illiquid. We are currently\nfocused on investing in what we believe are deeply undervalued microcapitalization publicly traded companies. Our publicly\ntraded and public company-related securities account for approximately 96 percent of the value of our portfolio of investments.\nAlthough these companies are publicly traded, their stock may not trade at high volumes and/or we may own a significant\nportion of a company's outstanding stock, which may restrict our ability to sell our positions in an orderly fashion and prices at\nwhich sales can be made may be volatile and materially different than the closing prices of such positions at each financial\nstatement date. We may also be subject to restrictions on transfer and/or other lock-up provisions after these companies\ncomplete public offerings and/or if we invest in unregistered securities of public companies. Many of our legacy privately held\nand publicly traded companies tend to not have attained profitability, and many of these companies also lack management depth\nand have limited or no history of operations. Because of the speculative nature of our investments and the lack of a liquid\nmarket for and restrictions on transfers of privately held investments, there is greater risk of loss relative to traditional\nmarketable investment securities.\nApproximately 5 percent of our portfolio was fair valued and comprised of securities of legacy privately held\ncompanies and rights to potential future milestone payments, as well as our warrants of Potbelly Corporation and options of\nSynchronoss Technologies, Inc. (Level 3 investments) which are securities of publicly traded companies. Because there is\ntypically no public or readily ascertainable market for our securities of our legacy privately held companies, the valuation of the\nsecurities in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our Valuation Committee, which is comprised of all of\nthe independent members of our Board of Directors. The values are determined in accordance with our Valuation Procedures\nand are subject to significant estimates and judgments. The fair value of the securities in our portfolio may differ significantly\nfrom the values that would be placed on these securities if a ready market for the securities existed. Additionally, inputs may\nbecome available after a financial statement date that could result in a material change in value at a future financial statement\n27\ndate from the value reported in the current financial statements. Any changes in valuation are recorded in the Company's\nConsolidated Statement of Operations as \"Change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.\" Changes in\nvaluation of any of our investments in privately held companies from one period to another may be significant.\nDiversification Risk\nWhile we are subject to certain diversification requirements regarding the concentration of investments in any one\nindustry or group of industries at the time of each investment, we do not choose investments based on a strategy of\ndiversification. We also do not rebalance the portfolio should one of our portfolio companies increase in value substantially\nrelative to the rest of the portfolio. Therefore, the value of our portfolio may be more vulnerable to microeconomic events\naffecting a single sector, industry or portfolio company and to general macroeconomic events that may be unrelated to our\nportfolio companies. These factors may subject the value of our portfolio to greater volatility than a company that follows a\ndiversification strategy. As of December 31, 2023, our largest 10 investments by value accounted for approximately 87 percent\nof the value of our investment portfolio. Our largest three investments, by value, Potbelly Corporation, comScore, Inc., and\nSynchronoss Technologies, Inc., accounted for approximately 27 percent, 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our\ninvestment portfolio at December 31, 2023. Potbelly Corporation, comScore, Inc. and Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. are\npublicly traded companies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We\nmay invest in both short- and long-term U.S. government and agency securities. To the extent that we invest in short- and long-\nterm U.S. government and agency securities, changes in interest rates result in changes in the value of these obligations that\nresult in an increase or decrease of our net asset value. The level of interest rate risk exposure at any given point in time\ndepends on the market environment, the expectations of future price and market movements, and the quantity and duration of\nlong-term U.S. government and agency securities held by the Company, and it will vary from period to period.\nIn addition, market interest rates for high-yield corporate debt may be an input in determining value of our investments\nin debt securities of privately held and publicly traded companies. Significant changes in these market rates could affect the\nvalue of our debt securities as of the valuation date of measurement of value. While we do not currently have any investments\nin debt securities with floating interest rates, investment income in such securities should we acquire them in the future could be\nadversely affected by changes in interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur investments are not subject to foreign currency risk as they are all denominated in U.S. dollars. We have one\ninvestment in a company based in Canada, D-Wave Quantum, Inc., however the price per share and terms of those shares are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars.\n28\nNOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023, our financial assets valued at fair value were categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using:\nUnadjusted Quoted\nPrices in Active\nMarkets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nDescription (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) December 31, 2023\nLegacy Privately Held\nEquity and Equity-\nRelated Securities:\nPreferred Stock $ 0 $ 0 $ 319,975 $ 319,975\nCommon Stock 0 0 15,091 15,091\nWarrants 0 0 0 0\nLLC Interests 0 0 150,000 150,000\nPublicly Traded Equity\nand Equity-Related\nSecurities:\nCommon Stock $ 48,200,221 $ 0 $ 0 $ 48,200,221\nMoney Market Mutual\nFund - Institutional\nClass Shares 96,445 0 0 96,445\nWarrants/Stock Options 0 0 480,114 480,114\nTotal Investments: $ 48,296,666 $ 0 $ 965,180 $ 49,261,846\nOther Financial\nInstruments:\nRights to Milestone\nPayments $ 0 $ 0 $ 1,356,391 $ 1,356,391\nTotal Financial Assets: $ 48,296,666 $ 0 $ 2,321,571 $ 50,618,237\n29\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nThe table below presents the valuation technique and quantitative information about the significant unobservable\ninputs utilized by the Company in the fair value measurements of Level 3 assets.

Common inputs for valuing Level 3 investments include\nprices from recently executed private transactions in a company’s securities or unconditional firm offers, revenue multiples of\ncomparable publicly traded companies, merger and acquisition (\"M&A\") transactions consummated by comparable companies,\ndiscounts for lack of marketability, rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of\nsecurities the portfolio company has issued, particularly related to potential liquidity scenarios of an initial public offering\n(\"IPO\") or an acquisition transaction, estimated time to exit, volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies and\nmanagement’s best estimate of risk attributable to non-performance risk. Certain securities are valued using the present value\nof future cash flows.\nWe may also consider changes in market values for sets of comparable companies when recent private transaction\ninformation is not available and/or in consideration of non-performance risk. We define non-performance risk as the risk that\nthe price per share (or implied valuation of a portfolio company) or the effective yield of a debt security of a portfolio company,\nas applicable, does not appropriately represent the risk that a portfolio company with negative cash flow will be: (a) unable to\nraise capital, will need to be shut down and will not return our invested capital; or (b) able to raise capital, but at a valuation\nsignificantly lower than the implied post-money valuation of the last round of financing. We assess non-performance risk for\neach private portfolio company quarterly. Our assessment of non-performance risk typically includes an evaluation of the\nfinancial condition and operating results of the company, the company's progress towards milestones, and the long-term\npotential of the business and technology of the company and how this potential may or may not affect the value of the shares\n30\nowned by us. An increase to the non-performance risk or a decrease in the private offering price of a future round of financing\nfrom that of the most recent round would result in a lower fair value measurement and/or a change in the distribution of value\namong the classes of securities we own.\nOption pricing models place a high weighting on liquidation preferences, which means that small differences in how\nthe preferences are structured can have a material effect on the fair value of our securities at the time of valuation and also on\nfuture valuations should additional rounds of financing occur with senior preferences. As such, valuations calculated by option\npricing models may not increase if 1) rounds of financing occur at higher prices per share, 2) liquidation preferences include\nmultiples on investment, 3) the amount of invested capital is small and/or 4) liquidation preferences are senior to prior rounds\nof financing. Additionally, an increase in the volatility assumption generally increases the enterprise value calculated in an\noption pricing model. An increase in the time to exit assumption also generally increases the enterprise value calculated in an\noption pricing model. Variations in the expected time to exit or expected volatility assumptions have a significant impact on fair\nvalue.\nWarrants and Stock Options\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of warrants and stock options held\nin our portfolio unless there is a publicly traded active market for such securities or another indication of value such as a sale of\nthe portfolio company or an expectation that we may exercise the security prior to expiration. Option pricing models, including\nthe Black-Scholes-Merton model, require the use of subjective input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life,\nexpected dividend rate, and expected risk-free rate of return. In the Black-Scholes-Merton model, variations in the expected\nvolatility or expected term assumptions have a significant impact on fair value.\nAn input to the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is the value per share of the type of stock for which the\nwarrant is exercisable as of the date of valuation. This input is derived according to the methodologies discussed in \"Preferred\nStock, Preferred Units, LLC Interests, Common Stock and Common Units.\"\nRights to Milestone Payments\nRights to milestone payments are valued using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. We are entitled to\npotential future payments from the acquisition of TARA Biosystems, Inc. by Valo Health, LLC. We assign probabilities to the\nachievements of the various milestones. Milestones identified as independent milestones can be achieved irrespective of the\nachievement of other contractual milestones. Dependent milestones are those that can only be achieved after another, or series\nof other, milestones are achieved. The interest rates used in these models are observable inputs from sources such as the\npublished interest rates for corporate bonds of the acquiring or comparable companies.\nChanges in Valuation Approaches\nThere were no changes in valuation approaches during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n31\nThe following chart shows the components of change in the financial assets categorized as Level 3 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023:\nAmount of Total\nAppreciation\n(Depreciation)\nfor the\nYear included in\nTotal Changes in Net\nTotal Unrealized Assets Attributable\nRealized (Depreciation) to the Change in\nGains (Loss) Appreciation Unrealized Gains or\nBeginning Included in Included in Investments in Disposals Ending Losses Relating to\nBalance Changes in Changes in Portfolio and Balance Assets Still Held at\n1/1/2023 Net Assets Transfers Net Assets Companies Settlements 12/31/2023 the Reporting Date\nPreferred Stock/\nUnits $ 6,435,925 $ (8,252,168) 1 $ 0 $ 2,173,393 $ 0 $ (37,175) $ 319,975 $ 76,688\nCommon Stock/\nMembership\nUnits 2,722,986 (2,923,003) 1 0 215,108 0 0 15,091 (1,323)\nWarrants/Stock\nOptions 215,631 (785) 1 0 265,268 0 0 480,114 264,483\nLLC Interests 218,534 0 0 (68,534) 0 0 150,000 (68,534)\nRights to\nMilestone\nPayments 2,842,814 (548,998) 1 0 684,316 0 (1,621,741) 1,356,391 135,318\nTotal $ 12,435,890 $ (11,724,954) $ 0 $ 3,269,551 $ 0 $ (1,658,916) $ 2,321,571 $ 406,632\n1 Represents gross realized losses.\n32\nNOTE 5.

OFFICERS' AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION\nThe aggregate compensation (salaries, 401(k) employer match, medical and dental benefits) paid by the Company\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, to its officers amounted to approximately $1.4 million. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere is no accrual for deferred bonuses for time-elapsed portion as in prior years.\nThe aggregate compensation paid by the Company to the independent members of its Board of Directors during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 was $253,104.\nCertain officers and directors currently and may in the future serve as members of the board of directors of our\nportfolio companies, including our controlled portfolio companies. These officers and directors do not receive any\ncompensation for serving in such roles directly from the portfolio companies. Any such cash compensation paid by portfolio\ncompanies to members of their respective boards of directors is paid directly to the Company. In the case of securities-based\ncompensation (restricted stock or stock options), the officer or director due such compensation assigns all beneficial interest,\nincluding but not limited to economic benefit and voting control, to such securities over to the Company.\nNOTE 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n401(k) Plan\nWe adopted a 401(k) Plan covering substantially all of our employees. Matching contributions to the plan are at the\ndiscretion of the Compensation Committee. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved a\n100 percent match, which amounted to $127,500.\nMedical Benefit Retirement Plan\nWe historically administered a plan to provide medical and dental insurance for retirees and their spouses who, at the\ntime of their retirement, attained certain years of service with us and a certain age (the \"Medical Benefit Retirement Plan\"). On\nApril 27, 2017, the Board of Directors terminated the plan. The termination does not affect benefits accrued by former\nemployees who are grandfathered under the former terms of the plan, and the termination of the plan does not affect benefits\naccrued by certain former employees who were grandfathered under the amended terms of the plan. The Medical Benefit\nRetirement Plan was terminated for all other employees. At December 31, 2023, we had $494,944 accrued for accumulated\npost-retirement benefit obligation for certain of these former employees, which is included in \"Post-retirement plan liabilities\"\non the Company's Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nExecutive Mandatory Retirement Benefit Plan\nOn May 5, 2011, the Board of Directors terminated the Amended and Restated Executive Mandatory Retirement\nBenefit Plan. Our former President accrued benefits under this plan prior to his retirement, and the termination of this plan has\nno impact on his accrued benefits. At December 31, 2023, we had $132,342 accrued for benefits for this former employee under\nthe plan, which is included in \"Post-retirement plan liabilities\" on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Assets and\nLiabilities.\n36\nThe plan is unfunded and has no assets. The following disclosures about changes in the benefit obligation under the\nplan to provide medical and dental insurance for retirees are as of the measurement date of December 31, 2023:\n2023\nAccumulated post-retirement benefit obligation - December 31, 2022 $ 507,563\nInterest cost 23,782\nActuarial loss 8,225\nBenefits paid (44,626)\nAccumulated post-retirement benefit obligation - December 31, 2023 $ 494,944\nIn accounting for the plan, the assumption made for the discount rate was 4.70 percent for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The discount rate was calculated using the December 31, 2023 FTSE Pension Liability Index. The\nassumed health care cost trend rates is assumed to be 7 percent in 2023 grading down to 5.60 percent uniformly over 3 years\nand then following the Getzen model thereafter for medical and 5 percent per year for dental.\nThe following is the net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n2023\nInterest cost on accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation $ 23,782\nAmortization of net gain (21,182)\nNet periodic post-retirement benefit cost $ 2,600\nThe Company estimates the following benefits to be paid in each of the following years:\n2024 $ 47,755\n2025 60,906\n2026 57,479\n2027 58,048\n2028 32,710\n2029 through 2033 153,490\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net unrecognized actuarial loss of $29,407 resulted primarily from the\ndecrease in the discount rate, which represents $8,225 of actuarial loss arising during the year, and from a reclassification\nadjustment of $21,182 that decreased the net periodic benefit cost for the year.\nNOTE 9. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company filed for the 1999 tax year to elect treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and qualified for\nthe same treatment for the years 2000 through 2015, as well as 2017 and 2019. The Company did not qualify as a RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Code in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Company did not have net taxable income in any of\n2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022 or 2023, so the failure to qualify as a RIC did not result in a tax liability for the Company. Under\nthe Code, if the Company fails to qualify as a RIC three years in a row, it would be subject to taxation as a C-Corporation on\nbuilt-in gains should realization of those gains occur within five years of the date of the last annual failure even if the Company\nqualified as a RIC in a future year.\n37\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company did not qualify as a RIC, and will therefore be taxed as a C-Corporation in\n2023, as a result of failing certain Diversification Tests. The failure to qualify as a RIC in 2023 is the fourth year in a row that\nsuch qualification was not attained. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any built-in gains that would be\nsubject to taxation as a C-Corporation should the Company qualify as a RIC in a future year. Additionally, should the\nCompany qualify as a RIC in a future year, it would be required to distribute any accumulated and undistributed ordinary\nincome and/or undistributed long-term capital gains. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any undistributed\nordinary income and/or undistributed long-term capital gains. As a C-Corporation, the Company is permitted to use historical\noperating loss carryforwards to offset income and gains for tax purposes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\napproximately $87.0 million in operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2026.\nThe Company's status as a RIC is irrevocable, but qualification is measured both quarterly and annually. Given the\nCompany's status as a RIC and that the ability or inability to use such operating loss carryforwards depends on qualification\nmetrics measured in each taxable year separate from prior years, the Company does not include a deferred tax asset and\nvaluation allowance on deferred tax asset on its Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nUnder certain circumstances, even if we qualified for Subchapter M treatment for a given year, we might act in a\nsubsequent year to ensure that we would be taxed in that subsequent year as a C Corporation, rather than as a RIC. We will fail\nto qualify for RIC tax treatment for a taxable year if we do not satisfy the 90 percent Income Test, the Diversification Tests or\nAnnual Distribution Requirement for such year. In the event we do not satisfy the 90 percent Income Test, Diversification Tests\nor the Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will be subject to federal tax with respect to all our taxable\nincome, whether or not distributed. In addition to the corporate tax that would be paid by the Company, all our distributions to\nshareholders in that situation generally will be taxable as ordinary dividends and generally subject to up to a 30 percent\nwithholding tax if received by a non-U.S. shareholder, although such dividends may qualify for long-term capital gain treatment\nas \"qualified dividends\" for U.S. shareholders meeting certain holding period requirements. If the aggregate values of our non-\nqualifying assets remain below 50 percent of total assets and no non-qualifying asset represents more than 25 percent of the\ntotal assets, we will continue to pass the Diversification Tests. Rather than selling portfolio companies that are performing well\nin order to pass our RIC Diversification Tests, we may opt instead not to qualify as a RIC. We will choose to take such action\nonly if we believe that the result of the action will benefit the Company and our shareholders.\nFor federal tax purposes, the Company’s 2020 through 2022 tax years remain open for examination by the tax\nauthorities under the normal three-year statute of limitations. Generally, for New Jersey state tax purposes, the Company’s\n2019 through 2022 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four-year statute of limitations. The\nCompany will file its 2023 federal and state taxes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a consolidated expense of $833 in federal, state and\nlocal income taxes.\nThe Company updated certain components of capital accounts on a tax-basis in 2023, to reflect a return of capital\nstatement of position (\"ROCSOP\") adjustment. This ROCSOP adjustment includes the reclassification of $3,816,683 of\naccumulated net operating loss and $6,272,740 of accumulated net realized loss into additional paid in capital. This\nreclassification results primarily from certain non-deductible expenses and net operating loss. There is no impact to net asset\nvalue per share as a result of this ROCSOP adjustment. This adjustment may change in future years if the Company does not\nqualify as a RIC in a given tax year.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's net unrealized depreciation of $29,663,378 was comprised of unrealized\ndepreciation of $40,271,721 and unrealized appreciation is $10,608,343. The book cost of investments is $80,281,615. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company's net tax unrealized depreciation of $28,702,992 was comprised of tax unrealized\ndepreciation of $39,311,335 and tax unrealized appreciation is $10,608,343. The tax cost of investments is $79,321,229. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company was in a loss position and therefore did not have any undistributed ordinary income and/or\nundistributed long-term capital gains.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had post-enactment loss carryforwards under the provisions of the Regulated Investment\nCompany Modernization Act of 2010 (the \"Act\") in aggregate of $19,789,848, long term. Capital losses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, were $5,695,394. As of December 31, 2023, we had cumulative capital losses, which were derived during\nyears when the Company failed as a RIC, totaling $6,767,387, which may be carried back 3 years or carried forward 5 years.\nCapital losses when the Company failed as a RIC of $1,919,139 was expired in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had\ncumulative capital losses, which were derived during years when the Company qualified as a RIC, totaling $13,022,461. Post-\nenactment losses have no expiration date in years where we qualify as a RIC.\n38\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Act\") was enacted, which among other changes,\nlowered the tax rates for corporations and how future loss carryforwards can be used against future gains. The change of the\nfederal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in the 2017 Act may impact future decisions regarding the issuance of\ndeemed dividends should the Company failed to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and be in a net taxable gain\nposition on investments.\nNOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPortfolio companies may seek additional capital in the future and any decision by the Company to not participate in the\nround of financing could result in outcomes that negatively impact the value of the Company's securities of those portfolio\ncompanies.\nOn November 17, 2021, the Company signed a lease extension through December 31, 2024. Upon an event of default,\nthe lease provides that the landlord may terminate the lease and require us to pay all rent that would have been payable during\nthe remainder of the lease or until the date the landlord re-enters the premises.\nNOTE 11.

(the\n“Company”), including the consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, cash flows, and changes net in assets, and the consolidated financial highlights for the year then\nended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). The consolidated statement of changes in net\nassets for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the consolidated financial highlights for each of the years in the four-year\nperiod ended December 31, 2022 were audited by another independent registered public accounting firm whose report, dated\nFebruary 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the consolidated statement of changes in net assets and the consolidated\nfinancial highlights. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows, consolidated\nchanges in its net assets and the consolidated financial highlights for the year then ended in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities\nowned as of December 31, 2023, by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and issuers of privately offered\nsecurities. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 20, 2024\n44\nPrivacy Policy\nWe are committed to protecting your privacy.

Our ultimate goal is to engage constructively with existing boards and management teams to unlock value through:\n• Resolution of capital structure or other overhangs that we believe inhibit growth of shareholder value\n• Realignment of financial performance to achieve growth of operating profits; not just revenues\n• Improvement of investor relations strategies and outreach\n• Evaluation of strategic options including mergers, acquisitions, sales, and divestitures\n• Identification of complementary talent and expertise\n• Introductions to what we believe are value-add resources and capabilities\n• Alignment of interests with, and support from, large shareholders\nWe are not averse, however, to pursue change through other routes including private and public shareholder communications, proxy solicitations,\nand/or joining boards of directors of our portfolio companies\nAll efforts will be grounded by and based on our fundamental research and diligence.\n9\nConstructive Activism\n1\nOur Levels of Constructive Activism\nThis is most often our initial level of engagement. These are investment opportunities that we believe do not require substantial time/involvement.\nApproach: Identify what we believe are quality, deeply undervalued companies with strong management teams in the process of executing a turnaround.\nConstructive Activism:\n• Introductions to our institutional investors and/or individual investors that own or have owned our stock.\n• Leverage our general knowledge of the public markets gained over our collective 40+ years of experience for advice and value-add introductions.\nThis level results from our determination that we need to become deeply involved in the company to help to build/unlock shareholder value.\nApproach: Identify what we believe are opportunities in which our capital and strategic involvement will result in immediate and long-term value\nappreciation.\nConstructive Activism (Levels 1 and 2+):\n• Work directly with managements / boards to remove value overhangs and evaluate strategic options.\n• Take seat(s) on boards.\n• Leverage ownership/control to drive increases in shareholder value.\n10\nT\nN\nE\nM\nE\nG\nA\nG\nN\nE\n1\nL\nE\nV\nE\nL\nInvestment opportunities that we believe, or have come to believe, may require some time/involvement, but not yet a substantial commitment.\nApproach: Identify what we believe are quality, deeply undervalued companies with strong management teams where we believe small changes can result in\nincreased value, and management is interested in engaging constructively.\nConstructive Activism (Level 1+):\n• Actively suggest changes to IR strategy and/or messaging.\n• Actively suggest changes in business related primarily to financial performance improvements.\nT\nN\nE\nM\nE\nG\nA\nG\nN\nE\n2\nL\nE\nV\nE\nL\nT\nN\nE\nM\nE\nG\nA\nG\nN\nE\n3\nL\nE\nV\nE\nL\n1This is a stylized representation of a complex process.
