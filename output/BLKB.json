We plan to put our strong cash flow to work in a purposeful capital allocation strategy that benefits our stockholders.

We've hired a strategic advisor to assist us in evaluating options and have recently rightsized the business to better align costs to revenues.

In the third quarter, our Social Sector, representing 89% of total revenue, grew at 6.6%.

Blackbaud's recent highlights.\n\n**Financial Outlook** Blackbaud today revised its 2024 full year financial guidance:\n\n  * GAAP revenue of $1.150 billion to $1.160 billion\n  * Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.0% to 34.0%\n  * Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.98 to $4.16\n  * Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $235 million to $245 million\n\n\n\nIncluded in its 2024 full year financial guidance are the following updated assumptions:\n\n  * Non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24.5%\n  * Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $53 million to $57 million\n  * Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately 51.0 million to 52.0 million\n  * Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately $65 million to $75 million, including approximately $60 million to $70 million of capitalized software and content development costs\n\n\n\nBlackbaud has not reconciled forward-looking full-year non-GAAP financial measures contained in this news release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliations would require unreasonable efforts at this time to estimate and quantify with a reasonable degree of certainty various necessary GAAP components, including for example those related to compensation, acquisition transactions and integration, tax items or others that may arise during the year. These components and other factors could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures, which may differ significantly from their non-GAAP counterparts.\n\nIn order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, Blackbaud uses non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow in analyzing its operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development, capital expenditures for property and equipment, plus cash outflows related to the previously disclosed Security Incident discovered in May 2020 (the \"Security Incident\"). Total costs related to the Security Incident exceeded the limit of our insurance coverage during the first quarter of 2022. For full year 2024, Blackbaud currently expects net cash outlays of $8 million to $13 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. In line with the company's policy, all associated costs due to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, are expensed as incurred. Please refer to the section below titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for more information on Blackbaud's use of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Stock Repurchase Program** As of September 30, 2024, Blackbaud had approximately $737 million remaining under its common stock repurchase program that was expanded, replenished and reauthorized in July 2024.\n\n**Conference Call Details** What: Blackbaud's 2024 Third Quarter Conference CallWhen: October 30, 2024Time: 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time)Live Call: 1-877-407-3088 (US/Canada)Webcast: [Blackbaud's Investor Relations Webpage](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4290384-1&h=1323058394&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.blackbaud.com%2F&a=Blackbaud%27s+Investor+Relations+Webpage)\n\n**About Blackbaud** Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) is the leading software provider exclusively dedicated to powering social impact.

These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Although Blackbaud attempts to be accurate in making these forward-looking statements, it is possible that future circumstances might differ from the assumptions on which such statements are based. In addition, other important factors that could cause results to differ materially include the following: management of integration of acquired companies; uncertainty regarding increased business and renewals from existing customers; a shifting revenue mix that may impact gross margin; continued success in sales growth; cybersecurity and data protection risks and related liabilities; potential litigation involving us; and the other risk factors set forth from time to time in the SEC filings for Blackbaud, copies of which are available free of charge at the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) or upon request from Blackbaud's investor relations department. Blackbaud assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n\n**Trademarks** All Blackbaud product names appearing herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Blackbaud, Inc.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** Blackbaud has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Blackbaud uses non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its operational performance. Accordingly, Blackbaud believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its ongoing operational performance and trends and in comparing its financial results from period-to-period with other companies in Blackbaud's industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures discussed above exclude the impact of certain transactions that Blackbaud believes are not directly related to its operating performance in any particular period, but are for its long-term benefit over multiple periods. Blackbaud believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect its ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in its business.\n\nWhile Blackbaud believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nAs previously disclosed, beginning in 2024, we apply a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.5% when calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. The non-GAAP tax rate utilized in future periods will be reviewed annually to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of our financial results including our periodic effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP, our operating environment and related tax legislation in effect and other factors deemed necessary. All 2023 measures of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included in this news release are calculated under Blackbaud's historical non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0%.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment. In addition, and in order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, Blackbaud also uses non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow in analyzing its operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment, plus cash outflows related to the Security Incident. Blackbaud believes non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow provide useful measures of the company's operating performance. Non-GAAP free cash flow and Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow are not intended to represent and should not be viewed as the amount of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nIn addition, Blackbaud uses non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth on a constant currency basis, in analyzing its operating performance. Blackbaud believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of its business on a consistent basis. Each of these measures excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies, if any, acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these measures reflects presentation of full-year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period. In addition, each of these measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses. The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods.

\n  \n(1)| Includes Security Incident-related costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which were insignificant, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $12.8 million, which included approximately $6.8 million in recorded liabilities for loss contingencies, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $4.1 million and $48.6 million, respectively, which included approximately $0.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in recorded aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies. Recorded expenses consisted primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, as well as settlements of customer claims, negotiated settlements and accruals for certain loss contingencies. Not included in this adjustment were costs associated with enhancements to our cybersecurity program. For full year 2024, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately $5 million to $10 million and cash outlays of approximately $8 million to $13 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. Not included in these ranges are our previous settlements or current accruals for loss contingencies related to the matters discussed below. In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded approximately $0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believe we can reasonably estimate. During the third quarter of 2024, we paid $6.8 million in connection with our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California (as previously disclosed on June 14, 2024). It is reasonably possible that our estimated or actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss. There are other Security Incident-related matters, including customer claims, customer constituent class actions and governmental investigations, for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of September 30, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Beginning in 2024, we now apply a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.5% when calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the tax impact related to non-GAAP adjustments is calculated under our historical non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0%.  \n  \n**Blackbaud, Inc.****Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **Three months ended****September 30 ,**| **Nine months ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nGAAP revenue(1)| $ 286,727| $ 277,626| $ 853,263| $ 810,421  \n**GAAP revenue growth**| **3.3 %**| **5.3 %**  \nLess: Non-GAAP revenue from divested businesses(2)| —| (2,692)| —| (5,189)  \nNon-GAAP organic revenue(2)| $ 286,727| $ 274,934| $ 853,263| $ 805,232  \n**Non-GAAP organic revenue growth**| **4.3 %**| **6.0 %**  \nNon-GAAP organic revenue(3)| $ 286,727| $ 274,934| $ 853,263| $ 805,232  \nForeign currency impact on non-GAAP organic revenue(4)| (1,024)| —| (2,130)| —  \nNon-GAAP organic revenue on constant currency basis(4)| $ 285,703| $ 274,934| $ 851,133| $ 805,232  \n**Non-GAAP organic revenue growth on constant currency basis**| **3.9 %**| **5.7 %**  \nGAAP recurring revenue| $ 280,018| $ 269,001| $ 832,912| $ 784,139  \n**GAAP recurring revenue growth**| **4.1 %**| **6.2 %**  \nLess: Non-GAAP recurring revenue from divested businesses(2)| —| —| —| —  \nNon-GAAP organic recurring revenue(3)| $ 280,018| $ 269,001| $ 832,912| $ 784,139  \n**Non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth**| **4.1 %**| **6.2 %**  \nNon-GAAP organic recurring revenue(2)| $ 280,018| $ 269,001| $ 832,912| $ 784,139  \nForeign currency impact on non-GAAP organic recurring revenue(4)| (1,005)| —| (2,070)| —  \nNon-GAAP organic recurring revenue on constant currency basis(4)| $ 279,013| $ 269,001| $ 830,842| $ 784,139  \n**Non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth on constant****currency basis**| **3.7 %**| **6.0 %**  \n  \n(1)| Includes EVERFI revenue of $19.4 million and $26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $66.8 million and $80.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Non-GAAP revenue from divested businesses excludes revenue associated with divested businesses.
