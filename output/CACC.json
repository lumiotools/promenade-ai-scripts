We ranked #2 among the top large companies in Michigan, the same as a year ago. This is the 13th year in a row that the Company has been recognized with this award by the Detroit Free Press. We also received the prestigious Managers Specialty Award for our leaders’ efforts to help team members grow and learn as well as for caring about their concerns.\n\n_“Credit Acceptance may be a remote-first company, but our roots remain firmly planted in Michigan, and we’re proud to be recognized as one of the state’s top workplaces,”_ said Ken Booth, CEO of Credit Acceptance. _“This award reaffirms our ongoing commitment to the communities we serve thanks to our generous team members and the intentional work we put into our company culture, allowing those team members to thrive in the workplace.”_\n\nCredit Acceptance has called Michigan home for over 50 years, nurturing numerous community partnerships through volunteer efforts championed by our team members. This past summer, team members contributed school supplies to the Pure Heart Foundation, supporting children with incarcerated parents. We have also partnered with Children’s Hospital of Michigan, assembling craft kits for the children there. Currently, we’re marking our 13th consecutive year supporting the Stone Soup Food Bank, helping to provide meals for those in need across Michigan. As a result, we’ve built a mission-driven workplace where team members feel connected to the community and supported in their professional and personal growth.\n\nThe company’s ranking was determined based on an anonymous survey administered by Energage, LLC, an employee research and culture technology firm that partners with the Detroit Free Press to identify top workplaces each year. The confidential survey uniquely measures the employee experience, including employees feeling respected and supported, enabled to grow, and empowered to execute.\n\nOur commitment to fostering a supportive, mission-driven workplace has earned us widespread recognition. This year alone, we’ve received 11 awards, including four honors from Great Place to Work® and _Fortune_ : 100 Best Companies to Work For®, Best Workplaces for WomenTM, Best Workplaces for MillennialsTM, and the 2024 Best Workplaces in Financial Services & InsuranceTM. In addition, Credit Acceptance has been named a Top Workplaces USA award winner for the fourth consecutive year, a Most Loved Workplace® for 2024 in several categories by the Best Practice Institute, and a _Newsweek_ America’s Top 200 Most Loved Workplace® for 2024, among many others.\n\n**_About Credit Acceptance_** We make vehicle ownership possible by providing innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.\n\nWithout our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase vehicles, or they purchase unreliable ones. Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing. Credit Acceptance is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol CACC.

Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $109.1 million, or $8.79 per diluted share, compared to $139.5 million, or $10.70 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The following table summarizes our financial results:\n\n(In millions, except per share data)| **For the Three Months Ended**| **For the Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nGAAP net income (loss)| $|  78.8 | $|  (47.1)| $|  70.8 | $|  96.0 | $|  192.5   \nGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share| $|  6.35 | $|  (3.83)| $|  5.43 | $|  7.68 | $|  14.73   \nAdjusted net income (1)| $|  109.1 | $|  126.4 | $|  139.5 | $|  352.9 | $|  406.5   \nAdjusted net income per diluted share (1)| $|  8.79 | $|  10.29 | $|  10.70 | $|  28.25 | $|  31.10   \n  \n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nOur results for the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the third quarter of 2023 included:\n\n  * **_A similar decline_**** _in forecasted collection rates_** A decline in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $62.8 million, or 0.6%, compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during the third quarter of 2023 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $69.4 million, or 0.7%.\n\n\n  * **_A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024_** Forecasted profitability was lower than our estimates at September 30, 2023, due to both a decline in forecasted collection rates and slower forecasted net cash flow timing since the third quarter of 2023. The slower forecasted net cash flow timing was primarily a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain at below-average levels.\n\n\n  * **_Growth in Consumer Loan assignment volume and the average balance of our loan portfolio_** Unit and dollar volumes grew 17.7% and 12.2%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The average balance of our loan portfolio, which is our largest-ever, increased 14.9% and 18.6% on a GAAP and adjusted basis, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * **_An increase in the initial spread on Consumer Loan assignments_** The initial spread increased to 21.9% compared to 21.4% on Consumer Loans assigned in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * **_An increase in our average cost of debt_** Our average cost of debt increased from 5.8% to 7.3%, primarily a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates.\n\n\n  * **_A decrease_**** _in common shares outstanding due to stock repurchases_** Since the third quarter of 2023, we have repurchased approximately 566,000 shares, or 4.5% of the shares outstanding as of September 30, 2023. There were no stock repurchases during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nOur results for the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the second quarter of 2024 included:\n\n  * **_A smaller decline in_** **_forecasted collection rates_** A decline in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $62.8 million, or 0.6%, compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during the second quarter of 2024 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $189.3 million, or 1.7%. The $189.3 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the second quarter of 2024 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $42.1 million, or 0.3%, and an adjustment applied to our forecasting methodology, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%.\n\n\n  * **_A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through_**** _2024_** Forecasted profitability was lower than our estimates at June 30, 2024, due to both the decline in forecasted collection rates and the slower forecasted net cash flow timing during the third quarter of 2024 discussed above.\n\n\n  * **_Growth in the average balance of our loan portfolio_** The average balance of our loan portfolio, which is our largest-ever, increased 2.6% and 4.3% on a GAAP and adjusted basis, respectively, as compared to the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * **_Loss on sale of building_** We recognized a $23.7 million loss during the second quarter of 2024 related to the sale of one of our two office buildings, which we have excluded from our adjusted results. The building was sold to reduce excess office space and eliminate the associated annual operating costs of approximately $2.1 million.\n\n\n\n**_Consumer Loan Metrics_**\n\nDealers assign retail installment contracts (referred to as “Consumer Loans”) to Credit Acceptance. At the time a Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment, we forecast future expected cash flows from the Consumer Loan. Based on the amount and timing of these forecasts and expected expense levels, an advance or one-time purchase payment is made to the related dealer at a price designed to maximize economic profit, a non-GAAP financial measure that considers our return on capital, our cost of capital, and the amount of capital invested. \n\nWe use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast. By comparing our current expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment, we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast. The following table compares our aggregated forecast of Consumer Loan collection rates as of September 30, 2024, with the aggregated forecasts as of June 30, 2024, as of December 31, 2023, and at the time of assignment, segmented by year of assignment:\n\n**Forecasted Collection Percentage as of (1)**| **Current Forecast Variance from**  \n---|---  \n**Consumer Loan Assignment Year**| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **Initial****Forecast**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **Initial****Forecast**  \n2015|  65.3 | %|  65.3 | %|  65.2 | %|  67.7 | %|  0.0 | %|  0.1 | %|  -2.4 | %  \n2016|  63.9 | %|  63.9 | %|  63.8 | %|  65.4 | %|  0.0 | %|  0.1 | %|  -1.5 | %  \n2017|  64.7 | %|  64.7 | %|  64.7 | %|  64.0 | %|  0.0 | %|  0.0 | %|  0.7 | %  \n2018|  65.5 | %|  65.5 | %|  65.5 | %|  63.6 | %|  0.0 | %|  0.0 | %|  1.9 | %  \n2019|  67.2 | %|  67.1 | %|  66.9 | %|  64.0 | %|  0.1 | %|  0.3 | %|  3.2 | %  \n2020|  67.6 | %|  67.7 | %|  67.6 | %|  63.4 | %|  -0.1 | %|  0.0 | %|  4.2 | %  \n2021|  63.8 | %|  64.1 | %|  64.5 | %|  66.3 | %|  -0.3 | %|  -0.7 | %|  -2.5 | %  \n2022|  60.6 | %|  61.1 | %|  62.7 | %|  67.5 | %|  -0.5 | %|  -2.1 | %|  -6.9 | %  \n2023|  64.3 | %|  64.5 | %|  67.4 | %|  67.5 | %|  -0.2 | %|  -3.1 | %|  -3.2 | %  \n2024 (2)|  66.6 | %|  66.6 | %|  — |  67.3 | %|  0.0 | %|  — |  -0.7 | %  \n  \n(1) Represents the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment. Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates.(2) The forecasted collection rate for 2024 Consumer Loans as of September 30, 2024 includes both Consumer Loans that were in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and Consumer Loans assigned during the most recent quarter. The following table provides forecasted collection rates for each of these segments:\n\n**Forecasted Collection Percentage as of**| **Current Forecast Variance from**  \n---|---  \n**2024****Consumer Loan Assignment Period**| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **Initial****Forecast**| **June 30, 2024**| **Initial****Forecast**  \nJanuary 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024|  66.4 | %|  66.6 | %|  67.2 | %|  -0.2 | %|  -0.8 | %  \nJuly 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024|  67.0 | %|  — |  67.3 | %|  — |  -0.3 | %  \n  \nConsumer Loans assigned in 2018 through 2020 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly better than our initial estimates, while Consumer Loans assigned in 2015, 2016, and 2021 through 2023 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly worse than our initial estimates. For all other assignment years presented, actual results have been close to our initial estimates. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, forecasted collection rates declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024 and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, forecasted collection rates improved for Consumer Loans assigned in 2019, declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024, and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented.\n\nThe changes in forecasted collection rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 impacted forecasted net cash flows (forecasted collections less forecasted dealer holdback payments) as follows:\n\n(Dollars in millions)| **For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**Decrease in Forecasted Net Cash Flows**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nDealer loans| $|  (43.6)| $|  (40.3)| $|  (173.0)| $|  (89.3)  \nPurchased loans|  (19.2)|  (29.1)|  (109.9)|  (60.0)  \nTotal| $|  (62.8)| $|  (69.4)| $|  (282.9)| $|  (149.3)  \n% change from forecast at beginning of period|  -0.6 | %|  -0.7 | %|  -2.8 | %|  -1.7 | %  \n  \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. More recently, Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%, and increased provision for credit losses by $127.5 million.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. We had experienced a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels and as a result, slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of the adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $44.5 million, or 0.5%, and increased provision for credit losses by $71.3 million.\n\nWe have experienced increased levels of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our loan portfolio since the beginning of 2020, with realized collections underperforming our expectations during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, outperforming our expectations following the distribution of federal stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, and underperforming our expectations during the current economic environment. For the period from January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2024, the cumulative change to our forecast of future net cash flows from our loan portfolio has been a decrease of $269.1 million, or 3.0%, as shown in the following table:\n\n(Dollars in millions)| **Increase (Decrease) in Forecasted Net Cash Flows**  \n---|---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Total Loans**| **% Change from Forecast at Beginning of Period**  \nMarch 31, 2020| $|  (206.5)|  -2.3 | %  \nJune 30, 2020|  24.4 |  0.3 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2020|  138.5 |  1.5 | %  \nDecember 31, 2020|  (2.7)|  0.0 | %  \nMarch 31, 2021|  107.4 |  1.1 | %  \nJune 30, 2021|  104.5 |  1.1 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2021|  82.3 |  0.9 | %  \nDecember 31, 2021|  31.9 |  0.3 | %  \nMarch 31, 2022|  110.2 |  1.2 | %  \nJune 30, 2022|  (43.4)|  -0.5 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2022|  (85.4)|  -0.9 | %  \nDecember 31, 2022|  (41.1)|  -0.5 | %  \nMarch 31, 2023|  9.4 |  0.1 | %  \nJune 30, 2023|  (89.3)|  -0.9 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2023|  (69.4)|  -0.7 | %  \nDecember 31, 2023|  (57.0)|  -0.6 | %  \nMarch 31, 2024|  (30.8)|  -0.3 | %  \nJune 30, 2024|  (189.3)|  -1.7 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2024|  (62.8)|  -0.6 | %  \nTotal| $|  (269.1)|  -3.0 | %  \n  \nThe following table presents information on Consumer Loan assignments for each of the last 10 years:\n\n**Average**| **Total Assignment Volume**  \n---|---  \n**Consumer Loan****Assignment Year**| **Consumer Loan (1)**| **Advance (2)**| **Initial Loan Term (in months)**| **Unit Volume**| **Dollar Volume (2)****(in millions)**  \n2015| $|  16,354| $|  7,272| 50| 298,288| $|  2,167.0  \n2016| 18,218| 7,976| 53| 330,710| 2,635.5  \n2017| 20,230| 8,746| 55| 328,507| 2,873.1  \n2018| 22,158| 9,635| 57| 373,329| 3,595.8  \n2019| 23,139| 10,174| 57| 369,805| 3,772.2  \n2020| 24,262| 10,656| 59| 341,967| 3,641.2  \n2021| 25,632| 11,790| 59| 268,730| 3,167.8  \n2022| 27,242| 12,924| 60| 280,467| 3,625.3  \n2023| 27,025| 12,475| 61| 332,499| 4,147.8  \n2024 (3)(4)| 26,564| 12,018| 61| 307,215| 3,692.1  \n  \n(1) Represents the repayments that we were contractually owed on Consumer Loans at the time of assignment, which include both principal and interest.(2) Represents advances paid to dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our portfolio program and one-time payments made to dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our purchase program. Payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included.(3) Represents activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Information in this table for each of the years prior to 2024 represents activity for all 12 months of that year.(4) The averages for 2024 Consumer Loans include both Consumer Loans that were in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and Consumer Loans assigned during the most recent quarter. The following table provides averages for each of these segments:\n\n**Average**  \n---  \n**2024****Consumer Loan Assignment Period**| **Consumer Loan**| **Advance**| **Initial Loan Term (in months)**  \nJanuary 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024| $|  26,554| $|  12,033|  61  \nJuly 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024|  26,586|  11,985|  61  \n  \nThe profitability of our loans is primarily driven by the amount and timing of the net cash flows we receive from the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate, less operating expenses and the cost of capital. Forecasting collection rates accurately at loan inception is difficult. With this in mind, we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability across our portfolio, even if collection rates are less than we initially forecast.\n\nThe following table presents aggregate forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, and spreads (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate), and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of September 30, 2024, as well as forecasted collection rates and spreads at the time of assignment. All amounts, unless otherwise noted, are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loan (principal + interest). The table includes both dealer loans and purchased loans.\n\n**Forecasted Collection % as of**| **Spread % as of**  \n---|---  \n**Consumer Loan Assignment Year**| **September 30, 2024**| **Initial Forecast**| **Advance % (1)**| **September 30, 2024**| **Initial Forecast**| **% of Forecast****Realized (2)**  \n2015|  65.3 | %|  67.7 | %|  44.5 | %|  20.8 | %|  23.2 | %|  99.7 | %  \n2016|  63.9 | %|  65.4 | %|  43.8 | %|  20.1 | %|  21.6 | %|  99.4 | %  \n2017|  64.7 | %|  64.0 | %|  43.2 | %|  21.5 | %|  20.8 | %|  99.1 | %  \n2018|  65.5 | %|  63.6 | %|  43.5 | %|  22.0 | %|  20.1 | %|  98.4 | %  \n2019|  67.2 | %|  64.0 | %|  44.0 | %|  23.2 | %|  20.0 | %|  96.1 | %  \n2020|  67.6 | %|  63.4 | %|  43.9 | %|  23.7 | %|  19.5 | %|  90.8 | %  \n2021|  63.8 | %|  66.3 | %|  46.0 | %|  17.8 | %|  20.3 | %|  80.8 | %  \n2022|  60.6 | %|  67.5 | %|  47.4 | %|  13.2 | %|  20.1 | %|  61.3 | %  \n2023|  64.3 | %|  67.5 | %|  46.2 | %|  18.1 | %|  21.3 | %|  36.8 | %  \n2024 (3)|  66.6 | %|  67.3 | %|  45.3 | %|  21.3 | %|  22.0 | %|  10.7 | %  \n  \n(1) Represents advances paid to dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our portfolio program and one-time payments made to dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loans. Payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included.(2) Presented as a percentage of total forecasted collections.(3) The forecasted collection rate, advance rate and spread for 2024 Consumer Loans as of September 30, 2024 include both Consumer Loans that were in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and Consumer Loans assigned during the most recent quarter. The following table provides forecasted collection rates, advance rates, and spreads for each of these segments:\n\n**Forecasted Collection % as of**| **Spread % as of**  \n---|---  \n**2024****Consumer Loan Assignment Period**| **September 30, 2024**| **Initial Forecast**| **Advance %**| **September 30, 2024**| **Initial Forecast**  \nJanuary 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024|  66.4 | %|  67.2 | %|  45.2 | %|  21.2 | %|  22.0 | %  \nJuly 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024|  67.0 | %|  67.3 | %|  45.4 | %|  21.6 | %|  21.9 | %  \n  \nThe risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the Consumer Loans age. For 2020 and prior Consumer Loan assignments, the risk of a material forecast variance is modest, as we have currently realized in excess of 90% of the expected collections. Conversely, the forecasted collection rates for more recent Consumer Loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized.\n\nThe spread between the forecasted collection rate as of September 30, 2024 and the advance rate ranges from 13.2% to 23.7%, on an annual basis, for Consumer Loans assigned over the last 10 years. The spreads with respect to 2019 and 2020 Consumer Loans have been positively impacted by Consumer Loan performance, which has exceeded our initial estimates by a greater margin than the other years presented. The spread with respect to 2022 Consumer Loans has been negatively impacted by Consumer Loan performance, which has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than the other years presented. The higher spread for 2024 Consumer Loans relative to 2023 Consumer Loans as of September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of Consumer Loan performance, as the performance of 2023 Consumer Loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 Consumer Loans. Additionally, 2024 Consumer Loans had a higher initial spread, which was primarily due to a decrease in the advance rate.\n\nThe following table compares our forecast of aggregate Consumer Loan collection rates as of September 30, 2024 with the forecasts at the time of assignment, for dealer loans and purchased loans separately:\n\n**Dealer Loans**| **Purchased Loans**  \n---|---  \n**Forecasted Collection Percentage as of (1)**| **Forecasted Collection Percentage as of (1)**  \n**Consumer Loan Assignment Year**| **September 30,****2024**| **Initial****Forecast**| **Variance**| **September 30,****2024**| **Initial****Forecast**| **Variance**  \n2015|  64.6 | %|  67.5 | %|  -2.9 | %|  69.0 | %|  68.5 | %|  0.5 | %  \n2016|  63.1 | %|  65.1 | %|  -2.0 | %|  66.1 | %|  66.5 | %|  -0.4 | %  \n2017|  64.0 | %|  63.8 | %|  0.2 | %|  66.3 | %|  64.6 | %|  1.7 | %  \n2018|  64.9 | %|  63.6 | %|  1.3 | %|  66.8 | %|  63.5 | %|  3.3 | %  \n2019|  66.8 | %|  63.9 | %|  2.9 | %|  67.9 | %|  64.2 | %|  3.7 | %  \n2020|  67.5 | %|  63.3 | %|  4.2 | %|  67.9 | %|  63.6 | %|  4.3 | %  \n2021|  63.5 | %|  66.3 | %|  -2.8 | %|  64.3 | %|  66.3 | %|  -2.0 | %  \n2022|  59.8 | %|  67.3 | %|  -7.5 | %|  62.4 | %|  68.0 | %|  -5.6 | %  \n2023|  63.1 | %|  66.8 | %|  -3.7 | %|  67.6 | %|  69.4 | %|  -1.8 | %  \n2024|  65.5 | %|  66.3 | %|  -0.8 | %|  70.5 | %|  70.7 | %|  -0.2 | %  \n  \n(1) The forecasted collection rates presented for dealer loans and purchased loans reflect the Consumer Loan classification at the time of assignment. The forecasted collection rates represent the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment. Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates.\n\nThe following table presents aggregate forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, and spreads (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate) as of September 30, 2024 for dealer loans and purchased loans separately.

(2) Represents advances paid to dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our portfolio program and one-time payments made to dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loans. Payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included.\n\nAlthough the advance rate on purchased loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on dealer loans, purchased loans do not require us to pay dealer holdback.\n\nThe spread as of September 30, 2024 on 2024 dealer loans was 21.2%, as compared to a spread of 18.3% on 2023 dealer loans. The increase was due to Consumer Loan performance, as the performance of 2023 dealer loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 dealer loans.\n\nThe spread as of September 30, 2024 on 2024 purchased loans was 21.5%, as compared to a spread of 17.8% on 2023 purchased loans. The increase was primarily a result of a higher initial spread on 2024 purchased loans, due to a higher initial forecast and lower advance rate. Additionally, the performance of 2023 purchased loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 purchased loans.\n\n**_Consumer Loan Volume_**\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in Consumer Loan assignment volume in each of the last seven quarters as compared to the same period in the previous year:\n\n**Year over Year Percent Change**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Unit Volume**| **Dollar Volume (1)**  \nMarch 31, 2023|  22.8 | %|  18.6 | %  \nJune 30, 2023|  12.8 | %|  8.3 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2023|  13.0 | %|  10.5 | %  \nDecember 31, 2023|  26.7 | %|  21.3 | %  \nMarch 31, 2024|  24.1 | %|  20.2 | %  \nJune 30, 2024|  20.9 | %|  16.3 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2024|  17.7 | %|  12.2 | %  \n  \n(1) Represents advances paid to dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our portfolio program and one-time payments made to dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our purchase program. Payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included.\n\nConsumer Loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including (1) the overall demand for our financing programs, (2) the amount of capital available to fund new loans, and (3) our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support. Our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate, within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints.\n\nUnit and dollar volumes grew 17.7% and 12.2%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024 as the number of active dealers grew 8.8% and the average unit volume per active dealer increased 8.4%. Dollar volume increased less than unit volume during the third quarter of 2024 due to a decrease in the average advance paid, due to decreases in the average size of Consumer Loans assigned and the average advance rate. Unit volume for the 28-day period ended October 28, 2024 grew 4.6% compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Consumer Loan unit volume and active dealers:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **For the Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \nConsumer Loan unit volume|  95,670|  81,299|  17.7 | %|  307,215|  253,847|  21.0 | %  \nActive dealers (1)|  10,678|  9,818|  8.8 | %|  14,326|  13,008|  10.1 | %  \nAverage volume per active dealer|  9.0|  8.3|  8.4 | %|  21.4|  19.5|  9.7 | %  \nConsumer Loan unit volume from dealers active both periods|  74,108|  67,930|  9.1 | %|  262,564|  228,157|  15.1 | %  \nDealers active both periods|  6,595|  6,595|  — |  9,604|  9,604|  —   \nAverage volume per dealer active both periods|  11.2|  10.3|  9.1 | %|  27.3|  23.8|  15.1 | %  \nConsumer loan unit volume from dealers _not_ active both periods|  21,562|  13,369|  61.3 | %|  44,651|  25,690|  73.8 | %  \nDealers _not_ active both periods|  4,083|  3,223|  26.7 | %|  4,722|  3,404|  38.7 | %  \nAverage volume per dealer _not_ active both periods|  5.3|  4.1|  29.3 | %|  9.5|  7.5|  26.7 | %  \n  \n(1) Active dealers are dealers who have received funding for at least one Consumer Loan during the period.\n\nThe following table provides additional information on the changes in Consumer Loan unit volume and active dealers: \n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **For the Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \nConsumer Loan unit volume from new active dealers|  3,447|  3,926|  -12.2 | %|  29,441|  29,005|  1.5 | %  \nNew active dealers (1)|  1,038|  983|  5.6 | %|  3,428|  3,095|  10.8 | %  \nAverage volume per new active dealer|  3.3|  4.0|  -17.5 | %|  8.6|  9.4|  -8.5 | %  \nAttrition (2)|  -16.4 | %|  -17.2 | %|  -10.1 | %|  -8.9 | %  \n  \n(1) New active dealers are dealers who enrolled in our program and have received funding for their first dealer loan or purchased loan from us during the period.(2) Attrition is measured according to the following formula: decrease in Consumer Loan unit volume from dealers who have received funding for at least one dealer loan or purchased loan during the comparable period of the prior year but did not receive funding for any dealer loans or purchased loans during the current period divided by prior year comparable period Consumer Loan unit volume.\n\nThe following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us as dealer loans and purchased loans for each of the last seven quarters:\n\n**Unit Volume**| **Dollar Volume (1)**  \n---|---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Dealer Loans**| **Purchased Loans**| **Dealer Loans**| **Purchased Loans**  \nMarch 31, 2023|  72.1 | %|  27.9 | %|  68.1 | %|  31.9 | %  \nJune 30, 2023|  72.4 | %|  27.6 | %|  68.6 | %|  31.4 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2023|  74.8 | %|  25.2 | %|  71.7 | %|  28.3 | %  \nDecember 31, 2023|  77.2 | %|  22.8 | %|  75.0 | %|  25.0 | %  \nMarch 31, 2024|  78.2 | %|  21.8 | %|  76.6 | %|  23.4 | %  \nJune 30, 2024|  78.5 | %|  21.5 | %|  77.3 | %|  22.7 | %  \nSeptember 30, 2024|  79.5 | %|  20.5 | %|  78.4 | %|  21.6 | %  \n  \n(1) Represents advances paid to dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our portfolio program and one-time payments made to dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our purchase program.

Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. The $282.9 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $135.7 million, or 1.4%, and an adjustment applied to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2024, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%, and increased our provision for credit losses by $127.5 million.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2023, we decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by $149.3 million, or 1.7%, to reflect a decline in forecasted collection rates during the period and slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing to reflect a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments. The $149.3 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the first nine months of 2023 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $104.8 million, or 1.2%, and an adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023, which upon implementation, decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by $44.5 million, or 0.5%, and increased our provision for credit losses by $71.3 million.\n\nThe following table summarizes each component of provision for credit losses:\n\n(In millions)| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Provision for Credit Losses**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nForecast changes| $|  430.9| $|  319.4| $|  111.5  \nNew Consumer Loan assignments|  260.4|  253.1|  7.3  \nTotal| $|  691.3| $|  572.5| $|  118.8  \n  \n  * An increase in operating expenses of 10.2% ($35.1 million), primarily due to: \n    * An increase in salaries and wages expense of 8.2% ($17.5 million), primarily due to increases in (i) the number of team members as we are investing in our business with the goal of increasing the speed at which we enhance our product for dealers and consumers and (ii) fringe benefits, primarily due to higher medical claims.\n    * An increase in general and administrative expense of 26.9% ($16.1 million), primarily due to increases in legal and technology systems expenses.\n  * A loss on sale of building of $23.7 million related to the sale of one of our two office buildings. The building was sold to reduce excess office space and eliminate the associated annual operating costs of approximately $2.1 million.\n  * An increase in premiums earned of 22.9% ($13.3 million), primarily due to growth in the size of our reinsurance portfolio, which resulted from growth in new Consumer Loan assignments and an increase in the average premium written per reinsured vehicle service contract in recent periods.\n  * A decrease in provision for income taxes of 29.1% ($17.1 million), primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income.\n  * An increase in finance charges of 13.1% ($170.7 million), primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio.\n\n\n\nAdjusted financial results are provided to help shareholders understand our financial performance. The financial data below is non-GAAP, unless labeled otherwise. We use adjusted financial information internally to measure financial performance and to determine certain incentive compensation. We also use economic profit as a framework to evaluate business decisions and strategies, with the objective to maximize economic profit over the long term. In addition, certain debt facilities utilize adjusted financial information for the determination of loan collateral values and to measure financial covenants. The table below shows our results following adjustments to reflect non-GAAP accounting methods. Material adjustments are explained in the table footnotes and the subsequent “Floating Yield Adjustment” and “Senior Notes Adjustment” sections. Measures such as adjusted average capital, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted interest expense (after-tax), adjusted net income plus adjusted interest expense (after-tax), adjusted return on capital, adjusted revenue, operating expenses, adjusted loans receivable, economic profit, and economic profit per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, include the following:\n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)| **For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **For the Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \nAdjusted average capital| $|  8,387.6 | $|  7,023.9 |  19.4 | %| $|  7,976.2 | $|  6,801.6 |  17.3 | %  \nAdjusted net income| $|  109.1 | $|  139.5 |  -21.8 | %| $|  352.9 | $|  406.5 |  -13.2 | %  \nAdjusted interest expense (after-tax)| $|  85.6 | $|  54.8 |  56.2 | %| $|  237.3 | $|  146.1 |  62.4 | %  \nAdjusted net income plus adjusted interest expense (after-tax)| $|  194.7 | $|  194.3 |  0.2 | %| $|  590.2 | $|  552.6 |  6.8 | %  \nAdjusted return on capital|  9.3 | %|  11.1 | %|  -16.2 | %|  9.9 | %|  10.8 | %|  -8.3 | %  \nCost of capital|  7.3 | %|  7.1 | %|  2.8 | %|  7.4 | %|  6.8 | %|  8.8 | %  \nEconomic profit| $|  41.4 | $|  69.1 |  -40.1 | %| $|  149.0 | $|  204.6 |  -27.2 | %  \nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding| 12,415,143 | 13,039,638 |  -4.8 | %| 12,494,011 | 13,068,998 |  -4.4 | %  \nAdjusted net income per diluted share| $|  8.79 | $|  10.70 |  -17.9 | %| $|  28.25 | $|  31.10 |  -9.2 | %  \nEconomic profit per diluted share| $|  3.33 | $|  5.30 |  -37.2 | %| $|  11.93 | $|  15.66 |  -23.8 | %  \n  \nEconomic profit decreased 40.1% and 27.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Economic profit is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business. The following table summarizes the impact each of these components had on the changes in economic profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023:\n\n(In millions)| **Year over Year Change in Economic Profit**  \n---|---  \n**For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \nDecrease in adjusted return on capital| $|  (37.3)| $|  (58.1)  \nIncrease in cost of capital|  (3.8)|  (33.0)  \nIncrease in adjusted average capital|  13.4 |  35.5   \nDecrease in economic profit| $|  (27.7)| $|  (55.6)  \n  \nThe decrease in economic profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily a result of the following:\n\n  * A decrease in our adjusted return on capital of 180 basis points, primarily due to a decrease in the yield used to recognize adjusted finance charges on our loan portfolio, primarily due to both a decline in forecasted collection rates and slower forecasted net cash flow timing since the second quarter of 2023. The slower forecasted net cash flow timing was primarily a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain at below-average levels.\n  * An increase in adjusted average capital of 19.4%, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio.\n\n\n\nThe decrease in economic profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily a result of the following:\n\n  * A decrease in our adjusted return on capital of 90 basis points, primarily due to: \n    * A decrease in the yield used to recognize adjusted finance charges on our loan portfolio decreased our adjusted return on capital by 130 basis points, primarily due to both a decline in forecasted collection rates and slower forecasted net cash flow timing since the first quarter of 2023. The slower forecasted net cash flow timing was primarily a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain at below-average levels.\n    * Slower growth in operating expenses increased our adjusted return on capital by 30 basis points as operating expenses grew by 10.2% while adjusted average capital grew by 17.3%.\n  * An increase in our cost of capital, primarily due to an increase in our cost of debt, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates.\n  * An increase in adjusted average capital of 17.3%, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio. \n\n\n\nThe following table shows adjusted revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of adjusted average capital, the adjusted return on capital, and the percentage change in adjusted average capital for each of the last eight quarters, compared to the same period in the prior year:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024**| **Jun. 30, 2024**| **Mar. 31, 2024**| **Dec. 31, 2023**| **Sept. 30, 2023**| **Jun. 30, 2023**| **Mar. 31, 2023**| **Dec. 31, 2022**  \nAdjusted revenue as a percentage of adjusted average capital (1)|  18.2 | %|  19.6 | %|  19.8 | %|  20.2 | %|  20.7 | %|  21.2 | %|  20.6 | %|  22.0 | %  \nOperating expenses as a percentage of adjusted average capital (1)|  6.2 | %|  6.2 | %|  6.7 | %|  6.3 | %|  6.3 | %|  6.9 | %|  7.2 | %|  6.4 | %  \nAdjusted return on capital (1)|  9.3 | %|  10.3 | %|  10.1 | %|  10.6 | %|  11.1 | %|  11.1 | %|  10.3 | %|  12.0 | %  \nPercentage change in adjusted average capital compared to the same period in the prior year|  19.4 | %|  17.6 | %|  14.6 | %|  11.5 | %|  8.8 | %|  6.2 | %|  1.0 | %|  -2.4 | %  \n  \n(1) Annualized.\n\nThe decrease in adjusted return on capital for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in the yield used to recognize adjusted finance charges on our loan portfolio, primarily due to both a decline in Consumer Loan performance and slower forecasted net cash flow timing in the second and third quarters of 2024, which is being recorded over time as an adjustment to the yield used to recognize adjusted finance charges.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures.

As this transaction is both unusual and infrequent in nature, we applied this adjustment to remove the impact of the loss on sale of building from our adjusted net income.(2) Adjustment to record taxes at our estimated long-term effective income tax rate of 23%. (3) Net income per diluted share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly net income per diluted share information may not equal year-to-date net income per diluted share.(4) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in the reversal of $118.5 million of provision for income taxes to reflect the new federal statutory income tax rate. This adjustment removes the impact of this reversal from adjusted average capital. We believe the income tax adjustment provides a more accurate reflection of the performance of our business as we are recognizing provision for income taxes at the applicable long-term effective tax rate for the period.(5) Annualized.\n\n(Dollars in millions)| **For the Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024**| **Jun. 30, 2024**| **Mar. 31, 2024**| **Dec. 31, 2023**| **Sept. 30, 2023**| **Jun. 30, 2023**| **Mar. 31, 2023**| **Dec. 31, 2022**  \n**Adjusted return on capital (1)**  \nAdjusted net income| $|  109.1 | $|  126.4 | $|  117.4 | $|  129.1 | $|  139.5 | $|  140.0 | $|  127.0 | $|  156.1   \nAdjusted interest expense (after-tax)|  85.6 |  80.5 |  71.2 |  63.4 |  54.8 |  48.9 |  42.4 |  38.6   \nAdjusted net income plus adjusted interest expense (after-tax)| $|  194.7 | $|  206.9 | $|  188.6 | $|  192.5 | $|  194.3 | $|  188.9 | $|  169.4 | $|  194.7   \n**Reconciliation of GAAP return on equity to adjusted return on capital****(4)**  \nGAAP return on equity (2)|  19.8 | %|  -11.6 | %|  15.3 | %|  21.6 | %|  16.4 | %|  5.1 | %|  23.8 | %|  31.1 | %  \nNon-GAAP adjustments|  -10.5 | %|  21.9 | %|  -5.2 | %|  -11.0 | %|  -5.3 | %|  6.0 | %|  -13.5 | %|  -19.1 | %  \nAdjusted return on capital (1)|  9.3 | %|  10.3 | %|  10.1 | %|  10.6 | %|  11.1 | %|  11.1 | %|  10.3 | %|  12.0 | %  \n**Economic profit**  \nAdjusted return on capital|  9.3 | %|  10.3 | %|  10.1 | %|  10.6 | %|  11.1 | %|  11.1 | %|  10.3 | %|  12.0 | %  \nCost of capital (3) (4)|  7.3 | %|  7.5 | %|  7.3 | %|  7.6 | %|  7.1 | %|  6.7 | %|  6.6 | %|  6.6 | %  \nAdjusted return on capital in excess of cost of capital|  2.0 | %|  2.8 | %|  2.8 | %|  3.0 | %|  4.0 | %|  4.4 | %|  3.7 | %|  5.4 | %  \nAdjusted average capital| $|  8,387.6 | $|  8,033.3 | $|  7,507.8 | $|  7,234.3 | $|  7,023.9 | $|  6,829.1 | $|  6,551.8 | $|  6,490.2   \nEconomic profit| $|  41.4 | $|  56.2 | $|  51.4 | $|  55.9 | $|  69.1 | $|  74.1 | $|  61.4 | $|  88.1   \n**Reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to economic profit**  \nGAAP net income (loss)| $|  78.8 | $|  (47.1)| $|  64.3 | $|  93.6 | $|  70.8 | $|  22.2 | $|  99.5 | $|  127.3   \nNon-GAAP adjustments|  30.3 |  173.5 |  53.1 |  35.5 |  68.7 |  117.8 |  27.5 |  28.8   \nAdjusted net income|  109.1 |  126.4 |  117.4 |  129.1 |  139.5 |  140.0 |  127.0 |  156.1   \nAdjusted interest expense (after-tax)|  85.6 |  80.5 |  71.2 |  63.4 |  54.8 |  48.9 |  42.4 |  38.6   \nAdjusted net income plus adjusted interest expense (after-tax)|  194.7 |  206.9 |  188.6 |  192.5 |  194.3 |  188.9 |  169.4 |  194.7   \nLess: cost of capital|  153.3 |  150.7 |  137.2 |  136.6 |  125.2 |  114.8 |  108.0 |  106.6   \nEconomic profit| $|  41.4 | $|  56.2 | $|  51.4 | $|  55.9 | $|  69.1 | $|  74.1 | $|  61.4 | $|  88.1   \nEconomic profit per diluted share (5)| $|  3.33 | $|  4.58 | $|  4.06 | $|  4.35 | $|  5.30 | $|  5.66 | $|  4.70 | $|  6.63   \nOperating expenses as a percentage of adjusted average capital (4)|  6.2 | %|  6.2 | %|  6.7 | %|  6.3 | %|  6.3 | %|  6.9 | %|  7.2 | %|  6.4 | %  \nPercentage change in adjusted average capital compared to the same period in the prior year|  19.4 | %|  17.6 | %|  14.6 | %|  11.5 | %|  8.8 | %|  6.2 | %|  1.0 | %|  -2.4 | %  \n  \n(1) Adjusted return on capital is defined as adjusted net income plus adjusted interest expense (after-tax) divided by adjusted average capital.(2) Calculated by dividing GAAP net income (loss) by GAAP average shareholders' equity.\n\n(3) The cost of capital includes both a cost of equity and a cost of debt. The cost of equity capital is determined based on a formula that considers the risk of the business and the risk associated with our use of debt. The formula utilized for determining the cost of equity capital is as follows: (the average 30-year Treasury rate + 5%) + [(1 – tax rate) x (the average 30-year Treasury rate + 5% – pre-tax average cost of debt rate) x average debt/(average equity + average debt x tax rate)].

As this transaction is both unusual and infrequent in nature, we applied this adjustment to remove the impact of the loss on sale of building from our adjusted net income. (2) Adjustment to record taxes at our estimated long-term effective income tax rate of 23%.(3) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in the reversal of $118.5 million of provision for income taxes to reflect the new federal statutory income tax rate. This adjustment removes the impact of this reversal from adjusted average capital. We believe the income tax adjustment provides a more accurate reflection of the performance of our business as we are recognizing provision for income taxes at the applicable long-term effective tax rate for the period.(4) Calculated by dividing GAAP net income by GAAP average shareholders' equity.(5) Adjusted return on capital is defined as adjusted net income plus adjusted interest expense after-tax divided by adjusted average capital.(6) The cost of capital includes both a cost of equity and a cost of debt. The cost of equity capital is determined based on a formula that considers the risk of the business and the risk associated with our use of debt. The formula utilized for determining the cost of equity capital is as follows: (the average 30-year Treasury rate + 5%) + [(1 - tax rate) x (the average 30-year Treasury rate + 5% - pre-tax average cost of debt rate) x average debt/(average equity + average debt x tax rate)]. For the periods presented, the average 30-year Treasury rate and the adjusted pre-tax average cost of debt were as follows:\n\n**For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAverage 30-year Treasury rate|  4.4 | %|  3.9 | %  \nAdjusted pre-tax average cost of debt (7)|  7.2 | %|  5.3 | %  \n  \n(7) Annualized(8) Economic profit per diluted share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly economic profit per diluted share information may not equal year-to-date economic profit per diluted share.\n\n**_Floating Yield Adjustment_**\n\nThe net loan income (finance charge revenue less provision for credit losses expense) that we recognize over the life of a loan equals the cash we collect from the underlying Consumer Loan less the cash we pay to the dealer. We believe the economics of our business are best exhibited by recognizing loan revenue on a level-yield basis over the life of the loan based on expected future net cash flows. The purpose of this non-GAAP adjustment is to provide insight into our business by showing this level yield measure of income. Under GAAP, contractual amounts due in excess of the loan receivable balance at the time of assignment will be reflected as interest income, while contractual amounts due that are not expected to be collected are reflected in the provision for credit losses. Our non-GAAP floating yield adjustment recognizes the net effects of contractual interest income and expected credit losses in a single measure of finance charge revenue, consistent with how we manage our business. The floating yield adjustment recognizes revenue on a level-yield basis based upon expected future net cash flows, with any changes in expected future net cash flows, which are recognized immediately under GAAP as provision for credit losses, recognized over the remaining forecast period (up to 120 months after the origination date of the underlying Consumer Loans) for each individual dealer loan and purchased loan. The floating yield adjustment does not accelerate revenue recognition. Rather, it reduces revenue by taking amounts that are reported under GAAP as provision for credit losses and instead treating them as reductions of revenue over time.\n\nUnder the GAAP methodology we employ, which is known as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL, we are required to recognize:\n\n  * a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of the loan’s assignment to us for contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize; and\n  * finance charge revenue in subsequent periods that is significantly in excess of our expected yield.\n\n\n\nDue to the GAAP treatment of contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize at the time of loan assignment (i.e. significant expense at the time of loan assignment, which is offset by higher revenue in subsequent periods), we do not believe the GAAP methodology we employ provides sufficient transparency into the economics of our business, including our results of operations, financial condition, and financial leverage. Our floating yield adjustment enables us to provide measures of income that are not impacted by GAAP’s treatment of contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize at the time of loan assignment. We believe the floating yield adjustment is presented in a manner which reflects both the economic reality of our business and how the business is managed and provides valuable supplemental information to help investors better understand our business, executive compensation, liquidity, and capital resources.\n\n**_Senior Notes Adjustment (applied in periods prior to December 31, 2023)_**\n\nThis non-GAAP adjustment modifies our GAAP financial results to treat the issuance of certain senior notes as a refinancing of certain previously issued senior notes. Our historical adjusted financial information reflects application of the senior notes adjustment as described below in connection with (i) the issuance by us in 2014 of $300.0 million principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 senior notes”) and the related retirement of our 9.125% senior notes due 2017 (the “2017 senior notes”) and (ii) the issuance by us in 2019 of $400.0 million principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 senior notes”) and the related retirement of the 2021 senior notes and our 7.375% senior notes due 2023 (the “2023 senior notes”).\n\nWe issued the 2024 senior notes on December 18, 2019. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2024 senior notes to repurchase or redeem all of the $300.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 2021 senior notes, of which $148.2 million was repurchased on December 18, 2019 and the remaining $151.8 million was redeemed on January 17, 2020. We used the remaining net proceeds from the 2024 senior notes, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to redeem in full the $250.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 2023 senior notes on March 15, 2020. Under GAAP, the fourth quarter of 2019 included (i) a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million related to the repurchase of 2021 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the redemption of the remaining 2021 senior notes in the first quarter of 2020 and (ii) additional interest expense of $0.3 million on $160.0 million of additional outstanding debt caused by the one month lag from the issuance of the 2024 senior notes and repurchase of 2021 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2019 to the redemption of the remaining 2021 senior notes in the first quarter of 2020. Under GAAP, the first quarter of 2020 included (i) a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $7.4 million related to the redemption of 2023 senior notes in the first quarter of 2020 and (ii) additional interest expense of $0.4 million on $160.0 million of additional outstanding debt caused by the one month lag from the issuance of the 2024 senior notes and repurchase of 2021 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2019 to the redemption of the remaining 2021 senior notes in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nWe issued the 2021 senior notes on January 22, 2014. On February 21, 2014, we used the net proceeds from the 2021 senior notes, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, to redeem in full the $350.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 2017 senior notes. Under GAAP, the first quarter of 2014 included (i) a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $21.8 million related to the redemption of the 2017 senior notes in the first quarter of 2014 and (ii) additional interest expense of $1.4 million on $276.0 million of additional outstanding debt caused by the one month lag from the issuance of the 2021 senior notes to the redemption of the 2017 senior notes.\n\nUnder our non-GAAP approach, the loss on extinguishment of debt and additional interest expense that were recognized for GAAP purposes were in each case deferred as debt issuance costs to be recognized ratably as interest expense over the term of the newly issued notes. In addition, for adjusted average capital purposes, the impact of additional outstanding debt related to the lag from the issuance of the new notes to the redemption of the previously issued notes was in each case deferred to be recognized ratably over the term of the newly issued notes. Upon the issuance of the 2024 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2019, the outstanding unamortized balances of the non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2021 senior notes were deferred and were being recognized ratably over the term of the 2024 senior notes, until the repurchase and redemption of the 2024 senior notes in December 2023.\n\nWe believe the application of the senior notes adjustment as described above provided a more accurate reflection of the performance of our business, since we were recognizing the costs incurred with these transactions in a manner consistent with how we recognize the costs incurred when we periodically refinance our other debt facilities. We have determined not to apply the senior notes adjustment in connection with the issuance by us in December 2023 of our 9.250% senior notes due 2028 and the related retirement of the 2024 senior notes, because the adjustment would not be material.\n\n**_Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information_**\n\nWe claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all of our forward-looking statements.

Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.\n\nWithout our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase vehicles or they purchase unreliable ones. Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing. Credit Acceptance is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol CACC.
