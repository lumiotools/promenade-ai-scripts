(NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $8.2 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $6.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $4.8 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the first quarter a year ago. The increase in first quarter 2024 profitability as compared to the prior quarter was primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income, a lower provision for credit losses, and a gain on sale of other real estate owned (“OREO”). The increase in profitability in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking income, higher net interest income, a lower provision for credit losses, unrealized gains on marketable equity securities, and a gain on an OREO sale.\n\nDividends per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased 2% to $0.61 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the fourth and first quarters of 2023.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, the Company announced by press release that Mr. Schierhorn resigned from his position as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, effective April 6, 2024. Mr. Schierhorn will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank. In connection with Mr. Schierhorn's resignation, Mr. Huston was appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank as part of the Company's long-term succession plans.\n\n“We are grateful for Mr. Schierhorn's many years of leadership as one of Northrim's charter employees and in his role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President,\" said Mike Huston. \"We look forward to his continued contributions as Chairman in the years ahead.”\n\n“First quarter results benefited from stable net interest income and operating expenses, lower credit loss provisions, and increased mortgage originations,” continued Mr. Huston. “We continued our expansion by opening a branch in Homer to build on the success of the loan production office we opened there in 2023. Despite the uncertain interest rate outlook, the Alaskan economy continues to perform well and we believe we are well-positioned in 2024.”\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n  * Net interest income in the first quarter of 2024 decreased 1% to $26.4 million compared to $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased 6% compared to $25.0 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis (“NIMTE”)* was 4.22% for the first quarter of 2024, up 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023 and down 8-basis points from the first quarter a year ago.\n  * The weighted average interest rate for portfolio loans originated in the first quarter of 2024 was 7.15% compared to 7.35% for loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 6.04% in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 1.19% and return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 13.84% for the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Portfolio loans were $1.81 billion at March 31, 2024, up 1% from the preceding quarter and up 18% from a year ago, primarily due to retaining certain mortgages originated by Residential Mortgage, a subsidiary of Northrim Bank (the “Bank”), in the loan portfolio, new customer relationships, and expanding market share.\n  * Total deposits were $2.43 billion at March 31, 2024, down 2% from the preceding quarter, and up 6% from $2.30 billion a year ago. Non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased 5% from the preceding quarter and decreased 7% year-over-year to $714.2 million at March 31, 2024 and represents 29% of total deposits.\n  * The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.13% at March 31, 2024, up from 2.00% at December 31, 2023 and 1.20% at March 31, 2023.\n  * A new branch opened in Homer, Alaska to serve the communities on the Kenai Peninsula along with the Soldotna branch that opened in 2019.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \n _(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_|  March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023| June 30, 2023| March 31, 2023  \nTotal assets| $| 2,759,560| $| 2,807,497| $| 2,790,189| $| 2,638,207| $| 2,580,037  \nTotal portfolio loans| $| 1,811,135| $| 1,789,497| $| 1,720,091| $| 1,659,239| $| 1,535,187  \nTotal deposits| $| 2,434,083| $| 2,485,055| $| 2,427,930| $| 2,302,311| $| 2,296,273  \nTotal shareholders’ equity| $| 239,327| $| 234,718| $| 225,259| $| 221,336| $| 224,425  \nNet income| $| 8,199| $| 6,613| $| 8,374| $| 5,577| $| 4,830  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 1.48| $| 1.19| $| 1.48| $| 0.98| $| 0.84  \nReturn on average assets| 1.19| %| 0.93| %| 1.22| %| 0.85| %| 0.76| %  \nReturn on average shareholders’ equity| 13.84| %| 11.36| %| 14.67| %| 9.85| %| 8.73| %  \nNIM| 4.16| %| 4.06| %| 4.15| %| 4.14| %| 4.22| %  \nNIMTE*| 4.22| %| 4.12| %| 4.21| %| 4.21| %| 4.30| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 68.93| %| 72.21| %| 66.64| %| 74.03| %| 78.51| %  \nTotal shareholders’ equity/total assets| 8.67| %| 8.36| %| 8.07| %| 8.39| %| 8.70| %  \nTangible common equity/tangible assets*| 8.14| %| 7.84| %| 7.54| %| 7.83| %| 8.13| %  \nBook value per share| $| 43.52| $| 42.57| $| 40.60| $| 39.45| $| 39.56  \nTangible book value per share*| $| 40.61| $| 39.68| $| 37.72| $| 36.60| $| 36.74  \nDividends per share| $| 0.61| $| 0.60| $| 0.60| $| 0.60| $| 0.60  \nCommon stock outstanding| 5,499,578| 5,513,459| 5,548,436| 5,610,841| 5,672,841  \n  \n* References to NIMTE, tangible book value per share, tangible common equity to tangible common assets, and tangible common equity to tangible assets, excluding the unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio, (all of which exclude intangible assets) represent non-GAAP financial measures.

See the end of this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Alaska Economic Update**(Note: sources for information included in this section are included on page 11.)\n\nThe Alaska Department of Labor (“DOL”) has reported Alaska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in February of 2024 was 4.7% compared to the U.S. rate of 3.9%. The total number of payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 2.6% or 8,200 jobs between February of 2023 and February of 2024. \n\nAccording to the DOL, Construction and Health Care had the largest growth in new jobs through February of 2024 compared to the prior year. The Construction sector added 1,900 positions for a year over year growth rate of 13.3% in February. The Health Care sector grew by 1,600 jobs for an annual growth rate of 4%. The Oil & Gas sector increased by 6.8% or 500 direct new jobs. Trade, Transportation & Utilities added 1,500 jobs year over year through February of 2024, up 2.4%. The Government sector grew by 1,400 jobs over the same period for 1.8% growth, mainly due to more state and local positions in Alaska.\n\nAlaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the fourth quarter of 2023, was estimated to be $68.7 billion in current dollars, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”). Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP grew 5.3% in all of 2023, placing Alaska fourth best of all 50 states. In the fourth quarter of 2023 Alaska grew at an annualized rate of 4.5%, compared to the average U.S. rate of 3.4%. Alaska’s real GSP improvement in the fourth quarter of 2023 was aided by gains in the Mining, Oil and Gas sector.\n\nThe BEA also calculated Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income at $53.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was an annual improvement of 4.3% for Alaska compared to the national average improvement of 5.2%.\n\nThe monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil was in a range between $75.64 and $95.05 in 2023. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 479 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The DOR has forecast production to decline slightly to 468 thousand bpd in Alaska’s fiscal year 2024 and grow to 477 thousand bpd in fiscal year 2025. The DOR projects the number to reach 641 thousand bpd by fiscal year 2034. This is primarily a result of new production coming on line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay. \n\nAccording to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single family home in Anchorage rose 5.4% in 2023 to $481,181, following a 7.6% increase in 2022. This was the sixth consecutive year of price increases.\n\nAverage sales prices for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 4% in 2023 to $397,589, after increasing 9.9% in 2022. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.\n\nHowever, the Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a large decrease in the number of units sold in both communities. There were 2,162 housing units sold in Anchorage in 2023, down 24.1% compared to 2,849 in 2022. In the Matanuska Susitna Borough there were 1,636 homes sold in 2023, compared to 2,103 in 2022, a decrease of 22.2%.\n\nNorthrim Bank sponsors the Alaskanomics blog to provide news, analysis, and commentary on Alaska’s economy.

Interest expense on deposits increased to $9.2 million in the first quarter compared to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNIMTE* was 4.22% in the first quarter of 2024 up from 4.12% in the preceding quarter and down from 4.30% in the first quarter a year ago. NIMTE* decreased 8 basis points in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in costs on interest-bearing deposits which was only partially offset by a favorable change in the mix of earning-assets towards higher loan balances as a percentage of total earning-assets, higher earning-assets, and higher yields on those assets. The weighted average interest rate for new loans booked in the first quarter of 2024 was 7.15% compared to 7.35% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 6.04% in the first quarter a year ago. No long-term investments were purchased during the first quarter of 2024, however, the yield on the portfolio increased to 2.82% for the quarter as a result of $45.6 million in maturities that had an average yield of 1.75% and repricing of the variable rate investments which represent 10% of the investment portfolio. “We continue to see modest deposit pricing pressure, however, the main impact on deposit cost is the mix of our deposit balances. Fortunately, we have been able to offset the cost increase with increased yields on our earning assets,” said Jed Ballard, Chief Financial Officer. Northrim’s NIMTE* continues to remain above the peer average posted by the S&P U.S. Small Cap Bank Index with total market capitalization between $250 million and $1 billion as of December 31, 20231.\n\n_Provision for Credit Losses_\n\nNorthrim recorded a provision for credit losses of $149,000 in the first quarter of 2024, which is the net of a $72,000 benefit for credit losses on unfunded commitments and a provision for credit losses on loans of $221,000 primarily as a result of loan growth, changes in assumptions in management's current expected credit losses model, and an increase in the allowance for loans individually evaluated. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $885,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, and provision for credit losses of $360,000 in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to lower loan growth during the quarter.\n\nNonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, increased during the quarter to $5.3 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $5.0 million at December 31, 2023, and decreased compared to $6.1 million at March 31, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses was 333% of nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, at the end of the first quarter of 2024, compared to 345% three months earlier and 233% a year ago.\n\n_Other Operating Income_\n\nIn addition to home mortgage lending, Northrim has interests in other businesses that complement its core community banking activities, including purchased receivables financing and wealth management. Other operating income contributed $7.8 million, or 23% of total first quarter 2024 revenues, as compared to $6.5 million, or 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $4.9 million, or 16% of revenues in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income due to a higher volume of mortgage activity. The fair market value of marketable equity securities increased $314,000 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to an increase of $565,000 in the prior quarter and a decrease of $223,000 in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter a year ago was due primarily to a higher volume of mortgage activity, as well as an increase in purchased receivable income due to higher balances and increased rates. See further discussion regarding mortgage activity during the first quarter contained under “Home Mortgage Lending” below.\n\n_Other Operating Expenses_\n\nOperating expenses were $23.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in other operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the first quarter of 2024 for subsequent proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022.\n\n1As of December 31, 2023, the S&P U.S. Small Cap Bank Index tracked 251 banks with total common market capitalization between $250 million to $1B for the following ratios: NIMTE* of 3.19%.\n\n_Income Tax Provision_\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Northrim recorded $2.3 million in state and federal income tax expense for an effective tax rate of 21.9%, compared to $1.7 million, or 20.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.2 million, or 20.4% in the first quarter a year ago. The increase in the tax rate in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2023 is primarily the result of a decrease in tax credits and tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n**Community Banking**\n\nIn the most recent deposit market share data from the FDIC, Northrim’s deposit market share in Alaska increased to 15.04% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2023 compared to 13.95% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2022. This represents 7.8% growth in market share percentage for Northrim during that period while, according to the FDIC, the total deposits in Alaska were down 8.5% during the same period. Northrim opened a branch in Kodiak in the first quarter of 2023, a loan production office in Homer in the second quarter of 2023, a permanent branch in Nome in the third quarter of 2023, and a branch in Homer in the first quarter of 2024. See below for further discussion regarding the Company's deposit movement for the quarter.\n\nNet interest income in the Community Banking segment totaled $24.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $24.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 mostly due to higher interest expense on deposits and lower interest income on short term and portfolio investments. These changes were only partially offset by higher interest income on loans and lower interest expense on borrowings.\n\nOther operating expenses totaled $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, down $964,000 or 5% from $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and up slightly from the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and other personnel expense and marketing expense, as well as a decrease in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the first quarter of 2024 for subsequent proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022.\n\nThe following table provides highlights of the Community Banking segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \n _(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_|  March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023| June 30, 2023| March 31, 2023  \nNet interest income| $| 24,215| $| 24,456| $| 24,050| $| 22,700| $| 24,752  \nProvision for credit losses| 197| 885| 1,190| 1,407| 360  \nOther operating income| 3,813| 4,048| 3,597| 3,067| 2,900  \nOther operating expense| 17,552| 18,516| 16,946| 17,805| 17,417  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 10,279| 9,103| 9,511| 6,555| 9,875  \nProvision for income taxes| 2,242| 1,941| 1,709| 1,192| 2,315  \nNet income| $| 8,037| $| 7,162| $| 7,802| $| 5,363| $| 7,560  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906| 5,677,292| 5,757,458  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 1.45| $| 1.29| $| 1.39| $| 0.94| $| 1.31  \n  \n**Home Mortgage Lending**\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, mortgage loans funded for sale increased to $84.3 million, of which 96% was for home purchases, compared to $79.7 million and 96% of loans funded for home purchases in the fourth quarter of 2023, and increased as compared to $50.7 million, of which 95% was for home purchases in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company has mortgage products including adjustable rate mortgages, a second home product, jumbo, and extended locks which are intended to appeal to customers given the current interest rate environment. During the first quarter of 2024, our home mortgage lending subsidiary, Residential Mortgage originated $17.4 million in home mortgages, of which roughly one-third were adjustable rate mortgages and two-thirds were mortgages for second homes, that the Bank purchased and booked at a weighted average interest rate of 6.65%, down from $27.1 million and 7.05% in the fourth quarter of 2023, $21.6 million and 6.60% in the third quarter of 2023, $55.6 million and 5.70% in the second quarter of 2023, and $42.0 million and 5.11% in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in mortgage loans funded for investment has increased net interest income in the Home Mortgage Lending segment. Net interest income contributed $2.2 million to total revenue in the first quarter of 2024, down slightly from $2.3 million in the prior quarter, and up from $280,000 in the first quarter a year ago.\n\nThe expansion efforts of mortgage production in the Arizona, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest markets contributed to 19% of Residential Mortgage's $102 million total production in the first quarter of 2024, 11% of the $107 million in total production in the fourth quarter of 2023, 8% of the $153 million in total production in the third quarter of 2023, 15% of the $169 million in total production in the second quarter of 2023, and 19% of $93 million in total production in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased mortgage banking income by $25,000 during the first quarter of 2024 compared to a decrease of $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease of $795,000 for the first quarter of 2023. Mortgage servicing revenue decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $2.2 million in the prior quarter and increased from $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to varying production of Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) mortgages, which contribute to servicing revenues at origination. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's servicing portfolio increased $15.5 million, which included $33.3 million in new mortgage loans, net of amortization and payoffs of $17.8 million as compared to a net increase of $62.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Northrim serviced 3,910 loans in its $1.06 billion home-mortgage-servicing portfolio, a 1% increase compared to the $1.04 billion serviced as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, and a 16% increase from the $911 million serviced a year ago.\n\nThe following table provides highlights of the Home Mortgage Lending segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \n _(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_|  March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023| June 30, 2023| March 31, 2023  \nMortgage commitments| $| 56,208| $| 22,926| $| 50,128| $| 71,123| $| 41,050  \nMortgage loans funded for sale| $| 84,324| $| 79,742| $| 131,863| $| 113,824| $| 50,725  \nMortgage loans funded for investment| 17,403| 27,114| 21,585| 55,595| 41,964  \nTotal mortgage loans funded| $| 101,727| $| 106,856| $| 153,448| $| 169,419| $| 92,689  \nMortgage loan refinances to total fundings| 4| %| 4| %| 5| %| 3| %| 5| %  \nMortgage loans serviced for others| $| 1,060,007| $| 1,044,516| $| 982,098| $| 921,616| $| 911,065  \nNet realized gains on mortgage loans sold| $| 1,980| $| 1,462| $| 2,491| $| 2,570| $| 1,305  \nChange in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net| 386| (296| )| (289| )| 358| 125  \nTotal production revenue| 2,366| 1,166| 2,202| 2,928| 1,430  \nMortgage servicing revenue| 1,561| 2,180| 2,396| 1,424| 1,368  \nChange in fair value of mortgage servicing rights:  \nDue to changes in model inputs of assumptions1| 289| (707| )| —| (3| )| (212| )  \nOther2| (314| )| (301| )| (310| )| (571| )| (583| )  \nTotal mortgage servicing revenue, net| 1,536| 1,172| 2,086| 850| 573  \nOther mortgage banking revenue| 129| 99| 117| 135| 5  \nTotal mortgage banking income| $| 4,031| $| 2,437| $| 4,405| $| 3,913| $| 2,008  \nNet interest income| $| 2,232| $| 2,276| $| 2,300| $| 2,442| $| 280  \n(Benefit) provision for credit losses| (48| )| —| —| —| —  \nMortgage banking income| 4,031| 2,437| 4,405| 3,913| 2,008  \nOther operating expense| 6,086| 5,477| 5,951| 5,977| 6,092  \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes| 225| (764| )| 754| 378| (3,804| )  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| 63| (215| )| 182| 164| (1,074| )  \nNet income (loss)| $| 162| $| (549| )| $| 572| $| 214| ($| 2,730| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906| 5,677,292| 5,757,458  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 0.03| $| (0.10| )| $| 0.09| $| 0.04| ($| 0.47| )  \n  \n1Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates.2Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nNorthrim’s total assets were $2.76 billion at March 31, 2024, down 2% from the preceding quarter and up 7% from a year ago. Northrim’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 74% at March 31, 2024, up from 72% at December 31, 2023, and 67% at March 31, 2023.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, our liquid assets and investments and loans maturing within one year were $515.6 million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $712.3 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets were $2.56 billion in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from $2.61 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 6% from $2.40 billion in the first quarter a year ago. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 5.69% in the first quarter of 2024, up from 5.51% in the preceding quarter and 5.10% in the first quarter a year ago.\n\nAverage investment securities decreased to $670.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $690.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $727.6 million in the first quarter a year ago. The average net tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was 2.82% for the first quarter of 2024, up from 2.48% in the preceding quarter and up from 2.40% in the year ago quarter. The average estimated duration of the investment portfolio at March 31, 2024, was approximately 2.7 years compared to approximately 3.1 years at March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, $48.8 million of available for sale securities with a weighted average yield of 1.83% are scheduled to mature in the next six months, $40.1 million with a weighted average yield of 0.66% are scheduled to mature in six months to one year, and $238.1 million with a weighted average yield of 1.52% are scheduled to mature in the following year, representing a total of $326.9 million or 13% of earning assets that are scheduled to mature in the next 24 months.\n\nTotal unrealized losses, net of tax, on available for sale securities decreased by $210,000 in the first quarter of 2024 resulting in total unrealized loss, net of tax, of $17.2 million compared to $17.4 million at December 31, 2023, and $24.3 million a year ago. The average maturity of the available for sale securities with the majority of the unrealized loss is 1.8 years. Total unrealized losses on held to maturity securities were $3.4 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2023, and $4.2 million a year ago.\n\nAverage interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased to $61.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $126.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $130.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 as cash was used to fund the growing loan portfolio and provide funds to deposit customers.\n\nPortfolio loans were $1.81 billion at March 31, 2024, up 1% from the preceding quarter and up 18% from a year ago. Portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, were $1.59 billion at March 31, 2024, relatively unchanged from the preceding quarter and up 12% from a year ago. Average portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2024 were $1.79 billion, which was up 2% from the preceding quarter and up 18% from a year ago. Yields on average portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2024 increased to 6.75% from 6.55% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased from 6.28% in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter a year ago is primarily due to loan repricing due to the increases in interest rates and new loans booked at higher rates due to changes in the interest rate environment. The yield on new portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, was 8.46% in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to 7.91% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 8.06% in the first quarter of 2023. Approximately 32% of loans mature or reprice in the next three months, 15% of loans mature or reprice in three to twelve months, and 16% of loans mature or reprice in one to two years.\n\nAlaskans continue to account for substantially all of Northrim’s deposit base. Total deposits were $2.43 billion at March 31, 2024, down 2% from $2.49 billion at December 31, 2023, and up 6% from $2.30 billion a year ago. “The decrease in deposits in the first quarter of 2024 were consistent with our customers' business cycles, where we typically see growth in the second half of the year,” said Ballard. At March 31, 2024, 70% of total deposits were held in business accounts and 30% of deposit balances were held in consumer accounts. Northrim had approximately 33,000 deposit customers with an average balance of $73,000 as of March 31, 2024. Northrim had 19 customers with balances over $10 million as of March 31, 2024, which accounted for $459.9 million, or 19%, of total deposits. Of these $459.9 million of deposits, approximately 35% are insured using ICS or CDARS and an additional 17% are long-term customers with whom Northrim has significant lending relationships. ICS and CDARS deposits are divided into amounts under the FDIC insurance maximum and allocated among member banks, making the large deposit eligible for FDIC insurance. Demand deposits decreased by 5% from the prior quarter and decreased 7% year-over-year to $714.2 million at March 31, 2024. Demand deposits decreased to 29% of total deposits at March 31, 2024 compared to 31% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 and 35% of total deposits at March 31, 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits were up slightly to $1.73 billion with an average cost of 2.13% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.72 billion and an average cost of 2.00% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and up 12% compared to $1.54 billion and an average cost of 1.20% in the first quarter of 2023. Uninsured deposits totaled $989.5 million or 41% of total deposits as of March 31, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion or 46% of total deposits as of December 31, 2022. Since interest rates began increasing in 2022, Northrim has taken a proactive, targeted approach to increase deposit rates.\n\nShareholders’ equity was $239.3 million, or $43.52 book value per share, at March 31, 2024, compared to $234.7 million, or $42.57 book value per share, at December 31, 2023 and $224.4 million, or $39.56 book value per share, a year ago. Tangible book value per share* was $40.61 at March 31, 2024, compared to $39.68 at December 31, 2023, and $36.74 per share a year ago. The increase in shareholders’ equity in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was largely the result of earnings of $8.2 million and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio, which increased $210,000, net of tax, which were only partially offset by dividends paid of $3.4 million and repurchases of common stock of $789,000. The Company purchased 15,034 shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2024 at an average cost of $52.46 per share and has 110,000 shares remaining under the current share repurchase program as of March 31, 2024. Tangible common equity to tangible assets* was 8.14% as of March 31, 2024. Tangible common equity to tangible common assets, excluding the impact of the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio*, was 8.71% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 8.41% as of December 31, 2023 and 8.99% as of March 31, 2023. Northrim continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 11.55% at March 31, 2024, compared to 11.43% at December 31, 2023, and 12.75% at March 31, 2023.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNorthrim believes it has a consistent lending approach throughout economic cycles, which emphasizes appropriate loan-to-value ratios, adequate debt coverage ratios, and competent management.\n\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) net of government guarantees were $5.4 million at March 31, 2024, down from $5.8 million at December 31, 2023 and down from $6.4 million a year ago. Of the NPAs at March 31, 2024, $3.3 million, or 61% are nonaccrual loans related to three commercial relationships.\n\nNet adversely classified loans were $7.2 million at March 31, 2024, as compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2023, and $7.2 million a year ago. Adversely classified loans are loans that Northrim has classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss, net of government guarantees. Net loan recoveries were $42,000 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to net loan charge-offs of $96,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, and net loan recoveries of $60,000 in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, Northrim had nine loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaling $4.8 million, net of government guarantees in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNorthrim had $123.1 million, or 7% of portfolio loans, in the Healthcare sector, $108.6 million, or 6% of portfolio loans, in the Tourism sector, $92.6 million, or 5% of portfolio loans, in the Accommodations sector, $74.0 million, or 4% of portfolio loans, in the Fishing sector, $74.0 million, or 4% of portfolio loans, in the Retail sector, $59.6 million, or 3% of portfolio loans, in the Aviation (non-tourism) sector, and $52.5 million, or 3% in the Restaurants and Breweries sector as of March 31, 2024.\n\nNorthrim estimates that $88.0 million, or approximately 5% of portfolio loans, had direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, as of March 31, 2024, and $1.8 million of these loans are adversely classified. As of March 31, 2024, Northrim has an additional $42.6 million in unfunded commitments to companies with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, and no unfunded commitments on adversely classified loans. Northrim defines direct exposure to the oil and gas sector as loans to borrowers that provide oilfield services and other companies that have been identified as significantly reliant upon activity in Alaska related to the oil and gas industry, such as lodging, equipment rental, transportation and other logistics services specific to this industry.\n\n**About Northrim BanCorp**\n\nNorthrim BanCorp, Inc. is the parent company of Northrim Bank, an Alaska-based community bank with 20 branches in Anchorage, Eagle River, the Matanuska Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, Juneau, Fairbanks, Nome, Kodiak, Ketchikan, and Sitka, serving 90% of Alaska’s population; and an asset-based lending division in Washington; and a wholly-owned mortgage brokerage company, Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC.

In addition, there are risks inherent in the banking industry relating to collectability of loans and changes in interest rates _._ Many of these risks, as well as other risks that may have a material adverse impact on our operations and business, are identified in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and from time to time are disclosed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, you should be aware that these factors are not an exhaustive list, and you should not assume these are the only factors that may cause our actual results to differ from our expectations. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release, and Northrim does not undertake any obligation to release revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or conditions after the date of this release.\n\n_Contact:_|  Mike Huston, President, CEO, and COO  \n---|---  \n _(907) 261-8750_  \nJed Ballard, Chief Financial Officer  \n _(907) 261-3539_  \n

Executive management at SCF has over 100 years of combined industry experience and will remain in their current positions.\n\n“The time working closely with Northrim as a lender and partner to Sallyport has given me a unique insight into how the team operates at all levels. I have been very impressed with Northrim’s ability to develop solutions and deliver on commitments which have provided growth and opportunity for customers. We are excited to be joining the Northrim team and look forward to what we can learn and accomplish together,” said Nick Hart, Co-Founder and President of SCF.\n\nNorthrim has previously invested in related financial enterprises as part of its growth and diversification strategy.

(NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $8.8 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.0 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024, and $8.4 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in third quarter 2024 profitability as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income and higher net interest income, which was only partially offset by higher other operating expenses and a higher provision for credit losses.\n\nDividends per share in the third quarter of 2024 increased to $0.62 per share as compared to $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2024 and $0.60 per share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“We had strong deposit-funded loan growth in the third quarter,” said Mike Huston, Northrim’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Deposits and loans both increased 7% from the end of the second quarter. Our deposit market share increased by 4% in the past year and by 42% in the past five years as our investments in people, expanded branch network, and differentiated service continue to attract new customers and strengthen existing relationships.”\n\n**Third** **Quarter** **2024****Highlights:**\n\n  * Net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 increased 7% to $28.8 million compared to $27.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and increased 9% compared to $26.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis (“NIMTE”)* was 4.35% for the third quarter of 2024, up 5-basis points from the second quarter of 2024 and up 14-basis points from the third quarter a year ago.\n\n\n  * Return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 1.22% and return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 13.69% for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * Portfolio loans were $2.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from the preceding quarter and up 17% from a year ago, primarily due to new customer relationships, expanding market share, and to retaining certain mortgages originated by Residential Mortgage, a subsidiary of Northrim Bank (the “Bank”), in the loan portfolio.\n\n\n  * Total deposits were $2.63 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from the preceding quarter, and up 8% from $2.43 billion a year ago. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 8% from the preceding quarter and decreased slightly year-over-year to $763.6 million at September 30, 2024 and represent 29% of total deposits.\n\n\n  * The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.24% at September 30, 2024, up from 2.21% at June 30, 2024 and 1.75% at September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * Mortgage loan originations increased to $248.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from $181.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $153.4 million in the third quarter a year ago. Mortgage loans funded for sale were $210.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $152.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $131.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial** **Highlights**|  Three Months Ended   \n---|---  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  September 30,2024| June 30, 2024| March 31, 2024| December 31,2023| September 30,2023  \nTotal assets| $2,963,392| $2,821,668| $2,759,560| $2,807,497| $2,790,189  \nTotal portfolio loans| $2,007,565| $1,875,907| $1,811,135| $1,789,497| $1,720,091  \nTotal deposits| $2,625,567| $2,463,806| $2,434,083| $2,485,055| $2,427,930  \nTotal shareholders’ equity| $260,050| $247,200| $239,327| $234,718| $225,259  \nNet income| $8,825| $9,020| $8,199| $6,613| $8,374  \nDiluted earnings per share| $1.57| $1.62| $1.48| $1.19| $1.48  \nReturn on average assets| 1.22| %| 1.31| %| 1.19| %| 0.93| %| 1.22| %  \nReturn on average shareholders’ equity| 13.69| %| 14.84| %| 13.84| %| 11.36| %| 14.67| %  \nNIM| 4.29| %| 4.24| %| 4.16| %| 4.06| %| 4.15| %  \nNIMTE*| 4.35| %| 4.30| %| 4.22| %| 4.12| %| 4.21| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 66.11| %| 68.78| %| 68.93| %| 72.21| %| 66.64| %  \nTotal shareholders’ equity/total assets| 8.78| %| 8.76| %| 8.67| %| 8.36| %| 8.07| %  \nTangible common equity/tangible assets*| 8.28| %| 8.24| %| 8.14| %| 7.84| %| 7.54| %  \nBook value per share| $47.27| $44.93| $43.52| $42.57| $40.60  \nTangible book value per share*| $44.36| $42.03| $40.61| $39.68| $37.72  \nDividends per share| $0.62| $0.61| $0.61| $0.60| $0.60  \nCommon stock outstanding| 5,501,943| 5,501,562| 5,499,578| 5,513,459| 5,548,436  \n  \n* References to NIMTE, tangible book value per share, and tangible common equity to tangible common assets, (all of which exclude intangible assets) represent non-GAAP financial measures.

The total number of payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 1.8% or 6,400 jobs between August of 2023 and August of 2024.\n\nAccording to the DOL, the Construction sector had the largest growth in new jobs through August compared to the prior year. The Construction sector added 2,600 positions for a year over year growth rate of 12.9% between August of 2023 and 2024. The larger Health Care sector grew by 2,000 jobs for an annual growth rate of 4.9% over the same period. The Oil & Gas sector increased by 6.5% or 500 new direct jobs. Professional and Business Services added 1,000 jobs year over year through August of 2024, up 3.4%. The Government sector grew by 700 jobs for 0.9% growth, adding 500 Federal jobs and 200 Local government positions in Alaska. The only sectors to decline between August 2023 and August 2024 were Manufacturing (primarily seafood processing) shrinking 1,300 positions and Information, down 200 jobs.\n\nAlaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the second quarter of 2024, was estimated to be $69.8 billion in current dollars, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (\"BEA\"). Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP increased 6.5% in 2023, placing Alaska fifth best of all 50 states. However, in the second quarter of 2024 Alaska decreased at an annualized rate of 1.1%, compared to the average U.S. growth rate of 3%. Alaska’s real GSP decline in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily caused by a slowdown in the Mining, Oil & Gas; and Transportation and Warehousing sectors.\n\nThe BEA also calculated Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income at $55.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. This was an annualized improvement of 4% for Alaska, compared to the national average of 5.3%.\n\nThe monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil was at an annual high of $89.05 in April of 2024 and averaged $74.06 in September of this year. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 479 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 and declined to 461 thousand bpd in Alaska’s fiscal year 2024. Starting in fiscal year 2025 it is projected to grow to 477 thousand bpd. The DOR projects the number to grow rapidly and reach 640 thousand bpd by fiscal year 2033. This is primarily a result of new production coming on-line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay.\n\nAccording to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single family home in Anchorage rose 5.2% in 2023 to $480,207, following a 7.6% increase in 2022. This was the sixth consecutive year of price increases. In the first nine months of 2024 the average price continues to increase 6.8% to an average sale of$512,815.\n\nThe average sales price for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 4% in 2023 to $397,589, after increasing 9.9% in 2022. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. In the first nine months of 2024 the average sales price increased 4.6% in the Matanuska Susitna Borough to $415,709. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.\n\nThe Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a 1.2% decrease in the number of units sold in Anchorage when comparing January to September of 2023 and 2024. There were 5.4% less homes sold in the Matanuska Susitna Borough for the same nine month time period in 2024 compared to the prior year.\n\nNorthrim Bank sponsors the Alaskanomics blog to provide news, analysis, and commentary on Alaska’s economy.

Interest expense on deposits increased to $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter and $7.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNIMTE* was 4.35% in the third quarter of 2024 up from 4.30% in the preceding quarter and 4.21% in the third quarter a year ago. NIMTE* increased 14 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a favorable change in the mix of earning-assets towards higher loan balances as a percentage of total earning-assets, higher earning-assets, and higher yields on those assets which were only partially offset by an increase in costs on interest-bearing deposits. The weighted average interest rate for new loans booked in the third quarter of 2024 was 7.24% compared to 7.90% in the second quarter of 2024 and 7.44% in the third quarter a year ago. The yield on the investment portfolio in the third quarter of 2024 decreased slightly to 2.80% from 2.82% in the second quarter of 2024 and increased from 2.43% in the third quarter of 2023. “We continue to see the benefit of new loan volume and repricing outweigh the modest increase in deposit costs in the third quarter of 2024,” said Jed Ballard, Chief Financial Officer. Northrim’s NIMTE* continues to remain above the peer average of 3.13% posted by the S&P U.S. Small Cap Bank Index with total market capitalization between $250 million and $1 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\n_Provision_ _for_ _Credit_ _Losses_\n\nNorthrim recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, which was comprised of of a $325,000 provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and a provision for credit losses on loans of $1.7 million. The provision for unfunded commitments was primarily due to an increase in unfunded commitments, as well as an increase in estimated loss rates due to changes in mix and management's assessment of economic conditions. The increase to the provision for credit losses on loans was primarily a result of loan growth, as well as an increase in the provision for loans individually evaluated and an increase in estimated loss rates. This compares to a benefit to the provision for credit losses of $120,000 in the second quarter of 2024, and provision for credit losses of $1.2 million in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nNonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, increased slightly during the quarter to $5.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $4.8 million at June 30, 2024, and decreased from $5.1 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans was 394% of nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 365% three months earlier and 326% a year ago.\n\n_Other_ _Operating_ _Income_\n\nIn addition to home mortgage lending, Northrim has interests in other businesses that complement its core community banking activities, including purchased receivables financing and wealth management. Other operating income contributed $11.6 million, or 29% of total third quarter 2024 revenues, as compared to $9.6 million, or 26% of revenues in the second quarter of 2024, and $8.0 million, or 23% of revenues in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income due to a higher volume of mortgage activity. See further discussion regarding mortgage activity during the second quarter contained under “Home Mortgage Lending” below. The fair market value of marketable equity securities increased $576,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a decrease of $60,000 in the prior quarter and an increase of $12,000 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter a year ago was due primarily to an increase in mortgage banking income as a result of higher volume of mortgage activity due to our expansion in Arizona, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest markets, as well as an increase in fair value of marketable equity securities.\n\n_Other_ _Operating_ _Expenses_\n\nOperating expenses were $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $22.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel expense, including $653,000 in mortgage commissions expense due to higher mortgage volume and a $979,000 increase in profit share expense, which was partially offset by a $836,000 decrease in medical claims expense. The increase in other operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel expense, as well as an increase in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022.\n\n_Income_ _Tax_ _Provision_\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Northrim recorded $2.8 million in state and federal income tax expense for an effective tax rate of 24.2%, compared to $2.5 million, or 21.9% in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million, or 18.4% in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in the tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 is primarily the result of a decrease in tax credits and tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n**Community** **Banking**\n\nIn the most recent deposit market share data from the FDIC, Northrim’s deposit market share in Alaska increased to 15.66% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2024 compared to 15.04% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2023. This represents 62 basis points of growth in market share percentage for Northrim during that period while, according to the FDIC, the total deposits in Alaska were up 2.3% during the same period. Northrim opened a branch in Kodiak in the first quarter of 2023, a loan production office in Homer in the second quarter of 2023, a permanent branch in Nome in the third quarter of 2023, and a branch in Homer in the first quarter of 2024. See below for further discussion regarding the Company's deposit movement for the quarter.\n\nNorthrim is committed to meeting the needs of the diverse communities in which it operates. As a testament to that support, the Bank has branches in four regions of Alaska identified by the Federal Reserve as 'distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income geographies'.\n\nNet interest income in the Community Banking segment totaled $25.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income increased 7% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 mostly due to higher interest income on loans. This increase was only partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits and borrowings and lower interest income on portfolio investments.\n\nOther operating expenses in the Community Banking segment totaled $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, up $588,000 or 3% from $18.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, and up $2.1 million or 13% from $16.9 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter was mostly due to an increases in salaries and other personnel expense, marketing expense, and professional fees. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily due to an increase in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022, as well as increases in salaries and other personnel expense and marketing expense.\n\nThe following tables provide highlights of the Community Banking segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember| March 31,| December| September  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  30, 2024| June 30, 2024| 2024| 31, 2023| 30, 2023  \nNet interest income| $25,901| $24,278| $24,215| $24,456| $24,050  \n(Benefit) provision for credit losses| 1,492| (184)| 197| 885| 1,190  \nOther operating income| 4,540| 3,693| 3,813| 4,048| 3,597  \nOther operating expense| 19,085| 18,497| 17,552| 18,516| 16,946  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 9,864| 9,658| 10,279| 9,103| 9,511  \nProvision for income taxes| 2,316| 2,004| 2,242| 1,941| 1,709  \nNet income| $7,548| $7,654| $8,037| $7,162| $7,802  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,583,055| 5,558,580| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906  \nDiluted earnings per share| $1.34| $1.37| $1.45| $1.29| $1.39  \n  \nYear-to-date  \n---  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nNet interest income| $| 74,394| $| 71,502  \nProvision for credit losses| 1,505| 2,957  \nOther operating income| 12,046| 9,564  \nOther operating expense| 55,134| 52,168  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 29,801| 25,941  \nProvision for income taxes| 6,562| 5,216  \nNet income Community Banking segment| $| 23,239| $| 20,725  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,574,135| 5,688,687  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 4.16| $| 3.64  \n  \n**Home Mortgage****Lending**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, mortgage loans funded for sale increased to $210.0 million, compared to $152.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $131.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Bank purchased Residential Mortgage-originated loans of $38.1 million of which roughly two-thirds were jumbos and one-third were mortgages for second homes, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.59%, up from $29.2 million and 6.82% in the second quarter of 2024, and up from $21.6 million and 6.60% in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in mortgage loans funded for investment has increased net interest income in the Home Mortgage Lending segment. Net interest income contributed $2.9 million to total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, up from $2.8 million in the prior quarter, and up from $2.3 million in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nThe Arizona, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest mortgage expansion markets were responsible for 20% of Residential Mortgage's $248 million total production in the third quarter of 2024, 22% of $182 million total production in the second quarter of 2024, and 8% of $153 million total production in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased mortgage banking income by $968,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a decrease of $81,000 for the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $310,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Mortgage servicing revenue increased to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $2.2 million in the prior quarter and from $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in production of Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) mortgages, which contribute to servicing revenues at origination. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company's servicing portfolio increased $64.8 million, which included $87.3 million in new mortgage loans, net of amortization and payoffs of $22.5 million as compared to a net increase of $41.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $58.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Northrim serviced 4,187 loans in its $1.17 billion home-mortgage-servicing portfolio, a 6% increase compared to the $1.10 billion serviced as of the end of the second quarter of 2024, and a 19% increase from the $982.1 million serviced a year ago.\n\nThe following tables provide highlights of the Home Mortgage Lending segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember| March 31,| December| September  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  30, 2024| June 30, 2024| 2024| 31, 2023| 30, 2023  \nMortgage commitments| $77,591| $88,006| $56,208| $22,926| $50,128  \nMortgage loans funded for sale| $209,960| $152,339| $84,324| $79,742| $131,863  \nMortgage loans funded for investment| 38,087| 29,175| 17,403| 27,114| 21,585  \nTotal mortgage loans funded| $248,047| $181,514| $101,727| $106,856| $153,448  \nMortgage loan refinances to total fundings| 6| %| 6| %| 4| %| 4| %| 5| %  \nMortgage loans serviced for others| $1,166,585| $1,101,800| $1,060,007| $1,044,516| $982,098  \nNet realized gains on mortgage loans sold| $5,079| $3,188| $1,980| $1,462| $2,491  \nChange in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net| 60| 391| 386| (296| )| (289| )  \nTotal production revenue| 5,139| 3,579| 2,366| 1,166| 2,202  \nMortgage servicing revenue| 2,583| 2,164| 1,561| 2,180| 2,396  \nChange in fair value of mortgage servicing rights:  \nDue to changes in model inputs of assumptions1| (566| )| 239| 289| (707| )| —  \nOther2| (402| )| (320| )| (314| )| (301| )| (310| )  \nTotal mortgage servicing revenue, net| 1,615| 2,083| 1,536| 1,172| 2,086  \nOther mortgage banking revenue| 293| 222| 129| 99| 117  \nTotal mortgage banking income| $7,047| $5,884| $4,031| $2,437| $4,405  \nNet interest income| $2,941| $2,775| $2,232| $2,276| $2,300  \nProvision (benefit) for credit losses| 571| 64| (48| )| —| —  \nMortgage banking income| 7,047| 5,884| 4,031| 2,437| 4,405  \nOther operating expense| 7,643| 6,697| 6,086| 5,477| 5,951  \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes| 1,774| 1,898| 225| (764| )| 754  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| 497| 532| 63| (215| )| 182  \nNet income (loss)| $1,277| $1,366| $162| ($549| )| $572  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,583,055| 5,558,580| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906  \nDiluted earnings per share| $0.23| $0.25| $0.03| ($0.10| )| $0.09  \n  \n1Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates.2Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\n\nYear-to-date  \n---  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nMortgage loans funded for sale| $446,623| $296,412  \nMortgage loans funded for investment| 84,665| 119,144  \nTotal mortgage loans funded| $531,288| $415,556  \nMortgage loan refinances to total fundings| 6| %| 5| %  \nNet realized gains on mortgage loans sold| $10,247| $6,366  \nChange in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net| 837| 194  \nTotal production revenue| 11,084| 6,560  \nMortgage servicing revenue| 6,308| 5,188  \nChange in fair value of mortgage servicing rights:  \nDue to changes in model inputs of assumptions1| (38| )| (215| )  \nOther2| (1,036| )| (1,464| )  \nTotal mortgage servicing revenue, net| 5,234| 3,509  \nOther mortgage banking revenue| 644| 257  \nTotal mortgage banking income| $16,962| $10,326  \nNet interest income| $7,948| $5,022  \nProvision for credit losses| 587| —  \nMortgage banking income| 16,962| 10,326  \nOther operating expense| 20,426| 18,020  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 3,897| (2,672| )  \nProvision for income taxes| 1,092| (728| )  \nNet (loss) income Home Mortgage Lending segment| $2,805| ($1,944| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,574,135| 5,688,687  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share| $0.51| ($0.34| )  \n  \n1Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates.2Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\n\n**Balance** **Sheet** **Review**\n\nNorthrim’s total assets were $2.96 billion at September 30, 2024, up 5% from the preceding quarter and up 6% from a year ago. Northrim’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 76% at September 30, 2024, consistent with 76% at June 30, 2024,and up from 71% at September 30, 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, our liquid assets, investments, and loans maturing within one year were $1.07 billion and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $641.7 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets were $2.67 billion in the third quarter of 2024, up 4% from $2.57 billion in the second quarter of 2024 and up 6% from $2.52 billion in the third quarter a year ago. The average yield on interest- earning assets was 5.92% in the third quarter of 2024, up from 5.83% in the preceding quarter and 5.48% in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nAverage investment securities decreased to $619.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $640.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $715.8 million in the third quarter a year ago. The average net tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was 2.80% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 2.82% in the preceding quarter\n\nand up from 2.43% in the year ago quarter. The average estimated duration of the investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, was approximately 2.3 years compared to approximately 2.8 years at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, $105.1 million of available for sale securities with a weighted average yield of 0.61% are scheduled to mature in the next six months, $73.0 million with a weighted average yield of 2.48% are scheduled to mature in six months to one year, and $177.8 million with a weighted average yield of 1.31% are scheduled to mature in the following year, representing a total of $355.9 million or 13% of earning assets that are scheduled to mature in the next 24 months.\n\nTotal unrealized losses, net of tax, on available for sale securities decreased by $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 resulting in total unrealized loss, net of tax, of $7.6 million compared to $15.2 million at June 30, 2024, and $26.5 million a year ago. The average maturity of the available for sale securities with the majority of the unrealized loss is 1.3 years. Total unrealized losses on held to maturity securities were $2.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $4.5 million a year ago.\n\nAverage interest bearing deposits in other banks increased to $28.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and decreased from $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, as deposit balances increased and cash was used to fund the loan growth and provide liquidity.\n\nPortfolio loans were $2.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from the preceding quarter and up 17% from a year ago. Portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, were $1.76 billion at September 30, 2024, up $105.2 million or 6% from the preceding quarter and up 14% from a year ago. This increase was diversified throughout the loan portfolio including commercial real estate nonowner-occupied and multi-family loans increasing by $33.2 million, construction loans increasing by $31.4 million, and commercial real estate owner-occupied loans increasing $29.0 million from the preceding quarter. Average portfolio loans in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.93 billion, which was up 5% from the preceding quarter and up 14% from a year ago. Yields on average portfolio loans in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 6.91% from 6.87% in the second quarter and from 6.61% in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on portfolio loans in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter a year ago is primarily due to loan repricing due to the increases in interest rates and new loans booked at higher rates due to changes in the interest rate environment. The yield on new portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, was 7.43% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 8.26% in the second quarter of 2024 and 7.75% in the third quarter of 2023. The drop in yields on new loan production was largely related to the large volume of new commercial real estate versus commercial loans, as noted above, as well as slightly better credit quality of the loans originated in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAlaskans continue to account for substantially all of Northrim’s deposit base. Total deposits were $2.63 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from $2.46 billion at June 30, 2024, and up 8% from $2.43 billion a year ago. “The increase in deposits in the third quarter of 2024 were consistent with our customers' business cycles and a result of continued acquisition of new relationships,” said Ballard. At September 30, 2024, 73% of total deposits were held in business accounts and 27% of deposit balances were held in consumer accounts. Northrim had approximately 34,000 deposit customers with an average balance of $48,000 as of September 30, 2024. Northrim had 22 customers with balances over $10 million as of September 30, 2024, which accounted for $978.4 million, or 38%, of total deposits. Demand deposits increased by 8% from the prior quarter and decreased slightly year-over-year to$763.6 million at September 30, 2024. Demand deposits remained consistent at 29% of total deposits at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 down from 31% of total deposits at September 30, 2023. Average interest- bearing deposits were up 4% to $1.80 billion with an average cost of 2.24% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.73 billion and an average cost of 2.21% in the second quarter of 2024, and up 11% compared to $1.62 billion and an average cost of 1.75% in the third quarter of 2023. Uninsured deposits totaled $1.12 billion or 43% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion or 46% of total deposits as of December 31, 2022. Since interest rates began increasing in 2022, Northrim has taken a proactive, targeted approach to increase deposit rates.\n\nShareholders’ equity was $260.1 million, or $47.27 book value per share, at September 30, 2024, compared to $247.2 million, or $44.93 book value per share, at June 30, 2024 and $225.3 million, or $40.60 book value per share, a year ago. Tangible book value per share* was $44.36 at September 30, 2024, compared to $42.03 at June\n\n30, 2024, and $37.72 per share a year ago. The increase in shareholders’ equity in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 was largely the result of earnings of $8.8 million and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio, which increased $7.6 million, net of tax, which were only partially offset by dividends paid of $3.4 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2024 and has 110,000 shares remaining under the current share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. Tangible common equity to tangible assets* was 8.28% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8.24% as of June 30, 2024 and 7.54% as of September 30, 2023. Northrim continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 11.53% at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.68% at June 30, 2024, and 11.67% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Asset** **Quality**\n\nNorthrim believes it has a consistent lending approach throughout economic cycles, which emphasizes appropriate loan-to-value ratios, adequate debt coverage ratios, and competent management.\n\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) net of government guarantees were $5.3 million at September 30, 2024, up from $5.1 million at June 30, 2024 and $5.2 million a year ago. Of the NPAs at September 30, 2024, $3.0 million, or 61%, are nonaccrual loans related to three commercial relationships.\n\nNet adversely classified loans were $6.5 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to $7.1 million at June 30, 2024, and $7.3 million a year ago. Adversely classified loans are loans that Northrim has classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss, net of government guarantees. Net loan recoveries were $96,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loan recoveries of $26,000 in the second quarter of 2024, and net loan recoveries of $96,000 in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, Northrim had 11 loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaling $3.1 million, net of government guarantees in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNorthrim had $127.4 million, or 6% of portfolio loans, in the Healthcare sector, $110.4 million, or 5% of portfolio loans, in the Tourism sector, $96.6 million, or 5% of portfolio loans, in the Accommodations sector, $83.6 million, or 4% of portfolio loans, in the Fishing sector, $70.6 million, or 3% of portfolio loans, in the Aviation (non-tourism) sector, $67.7 million, or 3% of portfolio loans, in the Retail sector, and $53.1 million, or 3% in the Restaurants and Breweries sector as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNorthrim estimates that $82.0 million, or approximately 4% of portfolio loans, had direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, as of September 30, 2024, and $1.6 million of these loans are adversely classified. As of September 30, 2024, Northrim has an additional $29.7 million in unfunded commitments to companies with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, and no unfunded commitments on adversely classified loans. Northrim defines direct exposure to the oil and gas sector as loans to borrowers that provide oilfield services and other companies that have been identified as significantly reliant upon activity in Alaska related to the oil and gas industry, such as lodging, equipment rental, transportation and other logistics services specific to this industry.\n\n**About** **Northrim****BanCorp**\n\nNorthrim BanCorp, Inc. is the parent company of Northrim Bank, an Alaska-based community bank with 20 branches in Anchorage, Eagle River, the Matanuska Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, Juneau, Fairbanks, Nome, Kodiak, Ketchikan, and Sitka, serving 90% of Alaska’s population; and an asset-based lending division in Washington; and a wholly-owned mortgage brokerage company, Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC.

(NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $8.2 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $6.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $4.8 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the first quarter a year ago. The increase in first quarter 2024 profitability as compared to the prior quarter was primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income, a lower provision for credit losses, and a gain on sale of other real estate owned (“OREO”). The increase in profitability in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking income, higher net interest income, a lower provision for credit losses, unrealized gains on marketable equity securities, and a gain on an OREO sale.\n\nDividends per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased 2% to $0.61 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the fourth and first quarters of 2023.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, the Company announced by press release that Mr. Schierhorn resigned from his position as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, effective April 6, 2024. Mr. Schierhorn will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank. In connection with Mr. Schierhorn's resignation, Mr. Huston was appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank as part of the Company's long-term succession plans.\n\n“We are grateful for Mr. Schierhorn's many years of leadership as one of Northrim's charter employees and in his role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President,\" said Mike Huston. \"We look forward to his continued contributions as Chairman in the years ahead.”\n\n“First quarter results benefited from stable net interest income and operating expenses, lower credit loss provisions, and increased mortgage originations,” continued Mr. Huston. “We continued our expansion by opening a branch in Homer to build on the success of the loan production office we opened there in 2023. Despite the uncertain interest rate outlook, the Alaskan economy continues to perform well and we believe we are well-positioned in 2024.”\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n  * Net interest income in the first quarter of 2024 decreased 1% to $26.4 million compared to $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased 6% compared to $25.0 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis (“NIMTE”)* was 4.22% for the first quarter of 2024, up 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023 and down 8-basis points from the first quarter a year ago.\n  * The weighted average interest rate for portfolio loans originated in the first quarter of 2024 was 7.15% compared to 7.35% for loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 6.04% in the first quarter a year ago. \n  * Return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 1.19% and return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 13.84% for the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Portfolio loans were $1.81 billion at March 31, 2024, up 1% from the preceding quarter and up 18% from a year ago, primarily due to retaining certain mortgages originated by Residential Mortgage, a subsidiary of Northrim Bank (the “Bank”), in the loan portfolio, new customer relationships, and expanding market share.\n  * Total deposits were $2.43 billion at March 31, 2024, down 2% from the preceding quarter, and up 6% from $2.30 billion a year ago. Non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased 5% from the preceding quarter and decreased 7% year-over-year to $714.2 million at March 31, 2024 and represents 29% of total deposits.\n  * The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.13% at March 31, 2024, up from 2.00% at December 31, 2023 and 1.20% at March 31, 2023.\n  * A new branch opened in Homer, Alaska to serve the communities on the Kenai Peninsula along with the Soldotna branch that opened in 2019.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \n _(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_|  March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023| June 30, 2023| March 31, 2023  \nTotal assets| $| 2,759,560| $| 2,807,497| $| 2,790,189| $| 2,638,207| $| 2,580,037  \nTotal portfolio loans| $| 1,811,135| $| 1,789,497| $| 1,720,091| $| 1,659,239| $| 1,535,187  \nTotal deposits| $| 2,434,083| $| 2,485,055| $| 2,427,930| $| 2,302,311| $| 2,296,273  \nTotal shareholders’ equity| $| 239,327| $| 234,718| $| 225,259| $| 221,336| $| 224,425  \nNet income| $| 8,199| $| 6,613| $| 8,374| $| 5,577| $| 4,830  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 1.48| $| 1.19| $| 1.48| $| 0.98| $| 0.84  \nReturn on average assets| 1.19| %| 0.93| %| 1.22| %| 0.85| %| 0.76| %  \nReturn on average shareholders’ equity| 13.84| %| 11.36| %| 14.67| %| 9.85| %| 8.73| %  \nNIM| 4.16| %| 4.06| %| 4.15| %| 4.14| %| 4.22| %  \nNIMTE*| 4.22| %| 4.12| %| 4.21| %| 4.21| %| 4.30| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 68.93| %| 72.21| %| 66.64| %| 74.03| %| 78.51| %  \nTotal shareholders’ equity/total assets| 8.67| %| 8.36| %| 8.07| %| 8.39| %| 8.70| %  \nTangible common equity/tangible assets*| 8.14| %| 7.84| %| 7.54| %| 7.83| %| 8.13| %  \nBook value per share| $| 43.52| $| 42.57| $| 40.60| $| 39.45| $| 39.56  \nTangible book value per share*| $| 40.61| $| 39.68| $| 37.72| $| 36.60| $| 36.74  \nDividends per share| $| 0.61| $| 0.60| $| 0.60| $| 0.60| $| 0.60  \nCommon stock outstanding| 5,499,578| 5,513,459| 5,548,436| 5,610,841| 5,672,841  \n  \n* References to NIMTE, tangible book value per share, tangible common equity to tangible common assets, and tangible common equity to tangible assets, excluding the unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio, (all of which exclude intangible assets) represent non-GAAP financial measures.

The total number of payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 2.6% or 8,200 jobs between February of 2023 and February of 2024. \n\nAccording to the DOL, Construction and Health Care had the largest growth in new jobs through February of 2024 compared to the prior year. The Construction sector added 1,900 positions for a year over year growth rate of 13.3% in February. The Health Care sector grew by 1,600 jobs for an annual growth rate of 4%. The Oil & Gas sector increased by 6.8% or 500 direct new jobs. Trade, Transportation & Utilities added 1,500 jobs year over year through February of 2024, up 2.4%. The Government sector grew by 1,400 jobs over the same period for 1.8% growth, mainly due to more state and local positions in Alaska.\n\nAlaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the fourth quarter of 2023, was estimated to be $68.7 billion in current dollars, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”). Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP grew 5.3% in all of 2023, placing Alaska fourth best of all 50 states. In the fourth quarter of 2023 Alaska grew at an annualized rate of 4.5%, compared to the average U.S. rate of 3.4%. Alaska’s real GSP improvement in the fourth quarter of 2023 was aided by gains in the Mining, Oil and Gas sector.\n\nThe BEA also calculated Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income at $53.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was an annual improvement of 4.3% for Alaska compared to the national average improvement of 5.2%.\n\nThe monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil was in a range between $75.64 and $95.05 in 2023. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 479 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The DOR has forecast production to decline slightly to 468 thousand bpd in Alaska’s fiscal year 2024 and grow to 477 thousand bpd in fiscal year 2025. The DOR projects the number to reach 641 thousand bpd by fiscal year 2034. This is primarily a result of new production coming on line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay. \n\nAccording to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single family home in Anchorage rose 5.4% in 2023 to $481,181, following a 7.6% increase in 2022. This was the sixth consecutive year of price increases.\n\nAverage sales prices for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 4% in 2023 to $397,589, after increasing 9.9% in 2022. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.\n\nHowever, the Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a large decrease in the number of units sold in both communities. There were 2,162 housing units sold in Anchorage in 2023, down 24.1% compared to 2,849 in 2022. In the Matanuska Susitna Borough there were 1,636 homes sold in 2023, compared to 2,103 in 2022, a decrease of 22.2%.\n\nNorthrim Bank sponsors the Alaskanomics blog to provide news, analysis, and commentary on Alaska’s economy.

Interest expense on deposits increased to $9.2 million in the first quarter compared to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNIMTE* was 4.22% in the first quarter of 2024 up from 4.12% in the preceding quarter and down from 4.30% in the first quarter a year ago. NIMTE* decreased 8 basis points in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in costs on interest-bearing deposits which was only partially offset by a favorable change in the mix of earning-assets towards higher loan balances as a percentage of total earning-assets, higher earning-assets, and higher yields on those assets. The weighted average interest rate for new loans booked in the first quarter of 2024 was 7.15% compared to 7.35% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 6.04% in the first quarter a year ago. No long-term investments were purchased during the first quarter of 2024, however, the yield on the portfolio increased to 2.82% for the quarter as a result of $45.6 million in maturities that had an average yield of 1.75% and repricing of the variable rate investments which represent 10% of the investment portfolio. “We continue to see modest deposit pricing pressure, however, the main impact on deposit cost is the mix of our deposit balances. Fortunately, we have been able to offset the cost increase with increased yields on our earning assets,” said Jed Ballard, Chief Financial Officer. Northrim’s NIMTE* continues to remain above the peer average posted by the S&P U.S. Small Cap Bank Index with total market capitalization between $250 million and $1 billion as of December 31, 20231.\n\n_Provision for Credit Losses_\n\nNorthrim recorded a provision for credit losses of $149,000 in the first quarter of 2024, which is the net of a $72,000 benefit for credit losses on unfunded commitments and a provision for credit losses on loans of $221,000 primarily as a result of loan growth, changes in assumptions in management's current expected credit losses model, and an increase in the allowance for loans individually evaluated. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $885,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, and provision for credit losses of $360,000 in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to lower loan growth during the quarter.\n\nNonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, increased during the quarter to $5.3 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $5.0 million at December 31, 2023, and decreased compared to $6.1 million at March 31, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses was 333% of nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, at the end of the first quarter of 2024, compared to 345% three months earlier and 233% a year ago.\n\n_Other Operating Income_\n\nIn addition to home mortgage lending, Northrim has interests in other businesses that complement its core community banking activities, including purchased receivables financing and wealth management. Other operating income contributed $7.8 million, or 23% of total first quarter 2024 revenues, as compared to $6.5 million, or 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $4.9 million, or 16% of revenues in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income due to a higher volume of mortgage activity. The fair market value of marketable equity securities increased $314,000 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to an increase of $565,000 in the prior quarter and a decrease of $223,000 in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter a year ago was due primarily to a higher volume of mortgage activity, as well as an increase in purchased receivable income due to higher balances and increased rates. See further discussion regarding mortgage activity during the first quarter contained under “Home Mortgage Lending” below.\n\n_Other Operating Expenses_\n\nOperating expenses were $23.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in other operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the first quarter of 2024 for subsequent proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022.\n\n1As of December 31, 2023, the S&P U.S. Small Cap Bank Index tracked 251 banks with total common market capitalization between $250 million to $1B for the following ratios: NIMTE* of 3.19%.\n\n_Income Tax Provision_\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Northrim recorded $2.3 million in state and federal income tax expense for an effective tax rate of 21.9%, compared to $1.7 million, or 20.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.2 million, or 20.4% in the first quarter a year ago. The increase in the tax rate in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2023 is primarily the result of a decrease in tax credits and tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n**Community Banking**\n\nIn the most recent deposit market share data from the FDIC, Northrim’s deposit market share in Alaska increased to 15.04% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2023 compared to 13.95% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2022. This represents 7.8% growth in market share percentage for Northrim during that period while, according to the FDIC, the total deposits in Alaska were down 8.5% during the same period. Northrim opened a branch in Kodiak in the first quarter of 2023, a loan production office in Homer in the second quarter of 2023, a permanent branch in Nome in the third quarter of 2023, and a branch in Homer in the first quarter of 2024. See below for further discussion regarding the Company's deposit movement for the quarter.\n\nNet interest income in the Community Banking segment totaled $24.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $24.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 mostly due to higher interest expense on deposits and lower interest income on short term and portfolio investments. These changes were only partially offset by higher interest income on loans and lower interest expense on borrowings.\n\nOther operating expenses totaled $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, down $964,000 or 5% from $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and up slightly from the first quarter a year ago. The decrease in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and other personnel expense and marketing expense, as well as a decrease in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the first quarter of 2024 for subsequent proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022.\n\nThe following table provides highlights of the Community Banking segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \n _(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_|  March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023| June 30, 2023| March 31, 2023  \nNet interest income| $| 24,215| $| 24,456| $| 24,050| $| 22,700| $| 24,752  \nProvision for credit losses| 197| 885| 1,190| 1,407| 360  \nOther operating income| 3,813| 4,048| 3,597| 3,067| 2,900  \nOther operating expense| 17,552| 18,516| 16,946| 17,805| 17,417  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 10,279| 9,103| 9,511| 6,555| 9,875  \nProvision for income taxes| 2,242| 1,941| 1,709| 1,192| 2,315  \nNet income| $| 8,037| $| 7,162| $| 7,802| $| 5,363| $| 7,560  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906| 5,677,292| 5,757,458  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 1.45| $| 1.29| $| 1.39| $| 0.94| $| 1.31  \n  \n**Home Mortgage Lending**\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, mortgage loans funded for sale increased to $84.3 million, of which 96% was for home purchases, compared to $79.7 million and 96% of loans funded for home purchases in the fourth quarter of 2023, and increased as compared to $50.7 million, of which 95% was for home purchases in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company has mortgage products including adjustable rate mortgages, a second home product, jumbo, and extended locks which are intended to appeal to customers given the current interest rate environment. During the first quarter of 2024, our home mortgage lending subsidiary, Residential Mortgage originated $17.4 million in home mortgages, of which roughly one-third were adjustable rate mortgages and two-thirds were mortgages for second homes, that the Bank purchased and booked at a weighted average interest rate of 6.65%, down from $27.1 million and 7.05% in the fourth quarter of 2023, $21.6 million and 6.60% in the third quarter of 2023, $55.6 million and 5.70% in the second quarter of 2023, and $42.0 million and 5.11% in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in mortgage loans funded for investment has increased net interest income in the Home Mortgage Lending segment. Net interest income contributed $2.2 million to total revenue in the first quarter of 2024, down slightly from $2.3 million in the prior quarter, and up from $280,000 in the first quarter a year ago.\n\nThe expansion efforts of mortgage production in the Arizona, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest markets contributed to 19% of Residential Mortgage's $102 million total production in the first quarter of 2024, 11% of the $107 million in total production in the fourth quarter of 2023, 8% of the $153 million in total production in the third quarter of 2023, 15% of the $169 million in total production in the second quarter of 2023, and 19% of $93 million in total production in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased mortgage banking income by $25,000 during the first quarter of 2024 compared to a decrease of $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease of $795,000 for the first quarter of 2023. Mortgage servicing revenue decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $2.2 million in the prior quarter and increased from $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to varying production of Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) mortgages, which contribute to servicing revenues at origination. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's servicing portfolio increased $15.5 million, which included $33.3 million in new mortgage loans, net of amortization and payoffs of $17.8 million as compared to a net increase of $62.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Northrim serviced 3,910 loans in its $1.06 billion home-mortgage-servicing portfolio, a 1% increase compared to the $1.04 billion serviced as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, and a 16% increase from the $911 million serviced a year ago.\n\nThe following table provides highlights of the Home Mortgage Lending segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \n _(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)_|  March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023| June 30, 2023| March 31, 2023  \nMortgage commitments| $| 56,208| $| 22,926| $| 50,128| $| 71,123| $| 41,050  \nMortgage loans funded for sale| $| 84,324| $| 79,742| $| 131,863| $| 113,824| $| 50,725  \nMortgage loans funded for investment| 17,403| 27,114| 21,585| 55,595| 41,964  \nTotal mortgage loans funded| $| 101,727| $| 106,856| $| 153,448| $| 169,419| $| 92,689  \nMortgage loan refinances to total fundings| 4| %| 4| %| 5| %| 3| %| 5| %  \nMortgage loans serviced for others| $| 1,060,007| $| 1,044,516| $| 982,098| $| 921,616| $| 911,065  \nNet realized gains on mortgage loans sold| $| 1,980| $| 1,462| $| 2,491| $| 2,570| $| 1,305  \nChange in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net| 386| (296| )| (289| )| 358| 125  \nTotal production revenue| 2,366| 1,166| 2,202| 2,928| 1,430  \nMortgage servicing revenue| 1,561| 2,180| 2,396| 1,424| 1,368  \nChange in fair value of mortgage servicing rights:  \nDue to changes in model inputs of assumptions1| 289| (707| )| —| (3| )| (212| )  \nOther2| (314| )| (301| )| (310| )| (571| )| (583| )  \nTotal mortgage servicing revenue, net| 1,536| 1,172| 2,086| 850| 573  \nOther mortgage banking revenue| 129| 99| 117| 135| 5  \nTotal mortgage banking income| $| 4,031| $| 2,437| $| 4,405| $| 3,913| $| 2,008  \nNet interest income| $| 2,232| $| 2,276| $| 2,300| $| 2,442| $| 280  \n(Benefit) provision for credit losses| (48| )| —| —| —| —  \nMortgage banking income| 4,031| 2,437| 4,405| 3,913| 2,008  \nOther operating expense| 6,086| 5,477| 5,951| 5,977| 6,092  \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes| 225| (764| )| 754| 378| (3,804| )  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| 63| (215| )| 182| 164| (1,074| )  \nNet income (loss)| $| 162| $| (549| )| $| 572| $| 214| ($| 2,730| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906| 5,677,292| 5,757,458  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 0.03| $| (0.10| )| $| 0.09| $| 0.04| ($| 0.47| )  \n  \n1Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates.2Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nNorthrim’s total assets were $2.76 billion at March 31, 2024, down 2% from the preceding quarter and up 7% from a year ago. Northrim’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 74% at March 31, 2024, up from 72% at December 31, 2023, and 67% at March 31, 2023.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, our liquid assets and investments and loans maturing within one year were $515.6 million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $712.3 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets were $2.56 billion in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from $2.61 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 6% from $2.40 billion in the first quarter a year ago. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 5.69% in the first quarter of 2024, up from 5.51% in the preceding quarter and 5.10% in the first quarter a year ago.\n\nAverage investment securities decreased to $670.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $690.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $727.6 million in the first quarter a year ago. The average net tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was 2.82% for the first quarter of 2024, up from 2.48% in the preceding quarter and up from 2.40% in the year ago quarter. The average estimated duration of the investment portfolio at March 31, 2024, was approximately 2.7 years compared to approximately 3.1 years at March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, $48.8 million of available for sale securities with a weighted average yield of 1.83% are scheduled to mature in the next six months, $40.1 million with a weighted average yield of 0.66% are scheduled to mature in six months to one year, and $238.1 million with a weighted average yield of 1.52% are scheduled to mature in the following year, representing a total of $326.9 million or 13% of earning assets that are scheduled to mature in the next 24 months.\n\nTotal unrealized losses, net of tax, on available for sale securities decreased by $210,000 in the first quarter of 2024 resulting in total unrealized loss, net of tax, of $17.2 million compared to $17.4 million at December 31, 2023, and $24.3 million a year ago. The average maturity of the available for sale securities with the majority of the unrealized loss is 1.8 years. Total unrealized losses on held to maturity securities were $3.4 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2023, and $4.2 million a year ago.\n\nAverage interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased to $61.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $126.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $130.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 as cash was used to fund the growing loan portfolio and provide funds to deposit customers.\n\nPortfolio loans were $1.81 billion at March 31, 2024, up 1% from the preceding quarter and up 18% from a year ago. Portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, were $1.59 billion at March 31, 2024, relatively unchanged from the preceding quarter and up 12% from a year ago. Average portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2024 were $1.79 billion, which was up 2% from the preceding quarter and up 18% from a year ago. Yields on average portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2024 increased to 6.75% from 6.55% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased from 6.28% in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter a year ago is primarily due to loan repricing due to the increases in interest rates and new loans booked at higher rates due to changes in the interest rate environment. The yield on new portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, was 8.46% in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to 7.91% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 8.06% in the first quarter of 2023. Approximately 32% of loans mature or reprice in the next three months, 15% of loans mature or reprice in three to twelve months, and 16% of loans mature or reprice in one to two years.\n\nAlaskans continue to account for substantially all of Northrim’s deposit base. Total deposits were $2.43 billion at March 31, 2024, down 2% from $2.49 billion at December 31, 2023, and up 6% from $2.30 billion a year ago. “The decrease in deposits in the first quarter of 2024 were consistent with our customers' business cycles, where we typically see growth in the second half of the year,” said Ballard. At March 31, 2024, 70% of total deposits were held in business accounts and 30% of deposit balances were held in consumer accounts. Northrim had approximately 33,000 deposit customers with an average balance of $73,000 as of March 31, 2024. Northrim had 19 customers with balances over $10 million as of March 31, 2024, which accounted for $459.9 million, or 19%, of total deposits. Of these $459.9 million of deposits, approximately 35% are insured using ICS or CDARS and an additional 17% are long-term customers with whom Northrim has significant lending relationships. ICS and CDARS deposits are divided into amounts under the FDIC insurance maximum and allocated among member banks, making the large deposit eligible for FDIC insurance. Demand deposits decreased by 5% from the prior quarter and decreased 7% year-over-year to $714.2 million at March 31, 2024. Demand deposits decreased to 29% of total deposits at March 31, 2024 compared to 31% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 and 35% of total deposits at March 31, 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits were up slightly to $1.73 billion with an average cost of 2.13% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.72 billion and an average cost of 2.00% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and up 12% compared to $1.54 billion and an average cost of 1.20% in the first quarter of 2023. Uninsured deposits totaled $989.5 million or 41% of total deposits as of March 31, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion or 46% of total deposits as of December 31, 2022. Since interest rates began increasing in 2022, Northrim has taken a proactive, targeted approach to increase deposit rates.\n\nShareholders’ equity was $239.3 million, or $43.52 book value per share, at March 31, 2024, compared to $234.7 million, or $42.57 book value per share, at December 31, 2023 and $224.4 million, or $39.56 book value per share, a year ago. Tangible book value per share* was $40.61 at March 31, 2024, compared to $39.68 at December 31, 2023, and $36.74 per share a year ago. The increase in shareholders’ equity in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was largely the result of earnings of $8.2 million and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio, which increased $210,000, net of tax, which were only partially offset by dividends paid of $3.4 million and repurchases of common stock of $789,000. The Company purchased 15,034 shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2024 at an average cost of $52.46 per share and has 110,000 shares remaining under the current share repurchase program as of March 31, 2024. Tangible common equity to tangible assets* was 8.14% as of March 31, 2024. Tangible common equity to tangible common assets, excluding the impact of the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio*, was 8.71% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 8.41% as of December 31, 2023 and 8.99% as of March 31, 2023. Northrim continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 11.55% at March 31, 2024, compared to 11.43% at December 31, 2023, and 12.75% at March 31, 2023.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNorthrim believes it has a consistent lending approach throughout economic cycles, which emphasizes appropriate loan-to-value ratios, adequate debt coverage ratios, and competent management.\n\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) net of government guarantees were $5.4 million at March 31, 2024, down from $5.8 million at December 31, 2023 and down from $6.4 million a year ago. Of the NPAs at March 31, 2024, $3.3 million, or 61% are nonaccrual loans related to three commercial relationships.\n\nNet adversely classified loans were $7.2 million at March 31, 2024, as compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2023, and $7.2 million a year ago. Adversely classified loans are loans that Northrim has classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss, net of government guarantees. Net loan recoveries were $42,000 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to net loan charge-offs of $96,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, and net loan recoveries of $60,000 in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, Northrim had nine loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaling $4.8 million, net of government guarantees in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNorthrim had $123.1 million, or 7% of portfolio loans, in the Healthcare sector, $108.6 million, or 6% of portfolio loans, in the Tourism sector, $92.6 million, or 5% of portfolio loans, in the Accommodations sector, $74.0 million, or 4% of portfolio loans, in the Fishing sector, $74.0 million, or 4% of portfolio loans, in the Retail sector, $59.6 million, or 3% of portfolio loans, in the Aviation (non-tourism) sector, and $52.5 million, or 3% in the Restaurants and Breweries sector as of March 31, 2024.\n\nNorthrim estimates that $88.0 million, or approximately 5% of portfolio loans, had direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, as of March 31, 2024, and $1.8 million of these loans are adversely classified. As of March 31, 2024, Northrim has an additional $42.6 million in unfunded commitments to companies with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, and no unfunded commitments on adversely classified loans. Northrim defines direct exposure to the oil and gas sector as loans to borrowers that provide oilfield services and other companies that have been identified as significantly reliant upon activity in Alaska related to the oil and gas industry, such as lodging, equipment rental, transportation and other logistics services specific to this industry.\n\n**About Northrim BanCorp**\n\nNorthrim BanCorp, Inc. is the parent company of Northrim Bank, an Alaska-based community bank with 20 branches in Anchorage, Eagle River, the Matanuska Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, Juneau, Fairbanks, Nome, Kodiak, Ketchikan, and Sitka, serving 90% of Alaska’s population; and an asset-based lending division in Washington; and a wholly-owned mortgage brokerage company, Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC.

We are excited to be joining the Northrim team and look forward to what we can learn and accomplish together,” said Nick Hart, Co-Founder and President of SCF.\n\nNorthrim has previously invested in related financial enterprises as part of its growth and diversification strategy.

(NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the “Company”) today reported net income of $8.8 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.0 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024, and $8.4 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in third quarter 2024 profitability as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income and higher net interest income, which was only partially offset by higher other operating expenses and a higher provision for credit losses.\n\nDividends per share in the third quarter of 2024 increased to $0.62 per share as compared to $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2024 and $0.60 per share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“We had strong deposit-funded loan growth in the third quarter,” said Mike Huston, Northrim’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Deposits and loans both increased 7% from the end of the second quarter. Our deposit market share increased by 4% in the past year and by 42% in the past five years as our investments in people, expanded branch network, and differentiated service continue to attract new customers and strengthen existing relationships.”\n\n**Third** **Quarter** **2024****Highlights:**\n\n  * Net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 increased 7% to $28.8 million compared to $27.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and increased 9% compared to $26.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis (“NIMTE”)* was 4.35% for the third quarter of 2024, up 5-basis points from the second quarter of 2024 and up 14-basis points from the third quarter a year ago.\n\n\n  * Return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 1.22% and return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 13.69% for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * Portfolio loans were $2.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from the preceding quarter and up 17% from a year ago, primarily due to new customer relationships, expanding market share, and to retaining certain mortgages originated by Residential Mortgage, a subsidiary of Northrim Bank (the “Bank”), in the loan portfolio.\n\n\n  * Total deposits were $2.63 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from the preceding quarter, and up 8% from $2.43 billion a year ago. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 8% from the preceding quarter and decreased slightly year-over-year to $763.6 million at September 30, 2024 and represent 29% of total deposits.\n\n\n  * The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.24% at September 30, 2024, up from 2.21% at June 30, 2024 and 1.75% at September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * Mortgage loan originations increased to $248.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from $181.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $153.4 million in the third quarter a year ago. Mortgage loans funded for sale were $210.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $152.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $131.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial** **Highlights**|  Three Months Ended   \n---|---  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  September 30,2024| June 30, 2024| March 31, 2024| December 31,2023| September 30,2023  \nTotal assets| $2,963,392| $2,821,668| $2,759,560| $2,807,497| $2,790,189  \nTotal portfolio loans| $2,007,565| $1,875,907| $1,811,135| $1,789,497| $1,720,091  \nTotal deposits| $2,625,567| $2,463,806| $2,434,083| $2,485,055| $2,427,930  \nTotal shareholders’ equity| $260,050| $247,200| $239,327| $234,718| $225,259  \nNet income| $8,825| $9,020| $8,199| $6,613| $8,374  \nDiluted earnings per share| $1.57| $1.62| $1.48| $1.19| $1.48  \nReturn on average assets| 1.22| %| 1.31| %| 1.19| %| 0.93| %| 1.22| %  \nReturn on average shareholders’ equity| 13.69| %| 14.84| %| 13.84| %| 11.36| %| 14.67| %  \nNIM| 4.29| %| 4.24| %| 4.16| %| 4.06| %| 4.15| %  \nNIMTE*| 4.35| %| 4.30| %| 4.22| %| 4.12| %| 4.21| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 66.11| %| 68.78| %| 68.93| %| 72.21| %| 66.64| %  \nTotal shareholders’ equity/total assets| 8.78| %| 8.76| %| 8.67| %| 8.36| %| 8.07| %  \nTangible common equity/tangible assets*| 8.28| %| 8.24| %| 8.14| %| 7.84| %| 7.54| %  \nBook value per share| $47.27| $44.93| $43.52| $42.57| $40.60  \nTangible book value per share*| $44.36| $42.03| $40.61| $39.68| $37.72  \nDividends per share| $0.62| $0.61| $0.61| $0.60| $0.60  \nCommon stock outstanding| 5,501,943| 5,501,562| 5,499,578| 5,513,459| 5,548,436  \n  \n* References to NIMTE, tangible book value per share, and tangible common equity to tangible common assets, (all of which exclude intangible assets) represent non-GAAP financial measures.

See the end of this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Alaska** **Economic****Update**(Note: sources for information included in this section are included on page 12.)\n\nThe Alaska Department of Labor (“DOL”) has reported Alaska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August of 2024 was 4.6% compared to the U.S. rate of 4.2%. The total number of payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 1.8% or 6,400 jobs between August of 2023 and August of 2024.\n\nAccording to the DOL, the Construction sector had the largest growth in new jobs through August compared to the prior year. The Construction sector added 2,600 positions for a year over year growth rate of 12.9% between August of 2023 and 2024. The larger Health Care sector grew by 2,000 jobs for an annual growth rate of 4.9% over the same period. The Oil & Gas sector increased by 6.5% or 500 new direct jobs. Professional and Business Services added 1,000 jobs year over year through August of 2024, up 3.4%. The Government sector grew by 700 jobs for 0.9% growth, adding 500 Federal jobs and 200 Local government positions in Alaska. The only sectors to decline between August 2023 and August 2024 were Manufacturing (primarily seafood processing) shrinking 1,300 positions and Information, down 200 jobs.\n\nAlaska’s Gross State Product (“GSP”) in the second quarter of 2024, was estimated to be $69.8 billion in current dollars, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (\"BEA\"). Alaska’s inflation adjusted “real” GSP increased 6.5% in 2023, placing Alaska fifth best of all 50 states. However, in the second quarter of 2024 Alaska decreased at an annualized rate of 1.1%, compared to the average U.S. growth rate of 3%. Alaska’s real GSP decline in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily caused by a slowdown in the Mining, Oil & Gas; and Transportation and Warehousing sectors.\n\nThe BEA also calculated Alaska’s seasonally adjusted personal income at $55.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. This was an annualized improvement of 4% for Alaska, compared to the national average of 5.3%.\n\nThe monthly average price of Alaska North Slope (“ANS”) crude oil was at an annual high of $89.05 in April of 2024 and averaged $74.06 in September of this year. The Alaska Department of Revenue (“DOR”) calculated ANS crude oil production was 479 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in Alaska’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 and declined to 461 thousand bpd in Alaska’s fiscal year 2024. Starting in fiscal year 2025 it is projected to grow to 477 thousand bpd. The DOR projects the number to grow rapidly and reach 640 thousand bpd by fiscal year 2033. This is primarily a result of new production coming on-line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay.\n\nAccording to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single family home in Anchorage rose 5.2% in 2023 to $480,207, following a 7.6% increase in 2022. This was the sixth consecutive year of price increases. In the first nine months of 2024 the average price continues to increase 6.8% to an average sale of$512,815.\n\nThe average sales price for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 4% in 2023 to $397,589, after increasing 9.9% in 2022. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. In the first nine months of 2024 the average sales price increased 4.6% in the Matanuska Susitna Borough to $415,709. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the Bank’s residential lending activity occurs.\n\nThe Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a 1.2% decrease in the number of units sold in Anchorage when comparing January to September of 2023 and 2024. There were 5.4% less homes sold in the Matanuska Susitna Borough for the same nine month time period in 2024 compared to the prior year.\n\nNorthrim Bank sponsors the Alaskanomics blog to provide news, analysis, and commentary on Alaska’s economy.

Interest expense on deposits increased to $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter and $7.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNIMTE* was 4.35% in the third quarter of 2024 up from 4.30% in the preceding quarter and 4.21% in the third quarter a year ago. NIMTE* increased 14 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a favorable change in the mix of earning-assets towards higher loan balances as a percentage of total earning-assets, higher earning-assets, and higher yields on those assets which were only partially offset by an increase in costs on interest-bearing deposits. The weighted average interest rate for new loans booked in the third quarter of 2024 was 7.24% compared to 7.90% in the second quarter of 2024 and 7.44% in the third quarter a year ago. The yield on the investment portfolio in the third quarter of 2024 decreased slightly to 2.80% from 2.82% in the second quarter of 2024 and increased from 2.43% in the third quarter of 2023. “We continue to see the benefit of new loan volume and repricing outweigh the modest increase in deposit costs in the third quarter of 2024,” said Jed Ballard, Chief Financial Officer. Northrim’s NIMTE* continues to remain above the peer average of 3.13% posted by the S&P U.S. Small Cap Bank Index with total market capitalization between $250 million and $1 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\n_Provision_ _for_ _Credit_ _Losses_\n\nNorthrim recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, which was comprised of of a $325,000 provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and a provision for credit losses on loans of $1.7 million. The provision for unfunded commitments was primarily due to an increase in unfunded commitments, as well as an increase in estimated loss rates due to changes in mix and management's assessment of economic conditions. The increase to the provision for credit losses on loans was primarily a result of loan growth, as well as an increase in the provision for loans individually evaluated and an increase in estimated loss rates. This compares to a benefit to the provision for credit losses of $120,000 in the second quarter of 2024, and provision for credit losses of $1.2 million in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nNonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, increased slightly during the quarter to $5.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $4.8 million at June 30, 2024, and decreased from $5.1 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans was 394% of nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 365% three months earlier and 326% a year ago.\n\n_Other_ _Operating_ _Income_\n\nIn addition to home mortgage lending, Northrim has interests in other businesses that complement its core community banking activities, including purchased receivables financing and wealth management. Other operating income contributed $11.6 million, or 29% of total third quarter 2024 revenues, as compared to $9.6 million, or 26% of revenues in the second quarter of 2024, and $8.0 million, or 23% of revenues in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in mortgage banking income due to a higher volume of mortgage activity. See further discussion regarding mortgage activity during the second quarter contained under “Home Mortgage Lending” below. The fair market value of marketable equity securities increased $576,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a decrease of $60,000 in the prior quarter and an increase of $12,000 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter a year ago was due primarily to an increase in mortgage banking income as a result of higher volume of mortgage activity due to our expansion in Arizona, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest markets, as well as an increase in fair value of marketable equity securities.\n\n_Other_ _Operating_ _Expenses_\n\nOperating expenses were $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $22.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel expense, including $653,000 in mortgage commissions expense due to higher mortgage volume and a $979,000 increase in profit share expense, which was partially offset by a $836,000 decrease in medical claims expense. The increase in other operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel expense, as well as an increase in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022.\n\n_Income_ _Tax_ _Provision_\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Northrim recorded $2.8 million in state and federal income tax expense for an effective tax rate of 24.2%, compared to $2.5 million, or 21.9% in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million, or 18.4% in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in the tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 is primarily the result of a decrease in tax credits and tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n**Community** **Banking**\n\nIn the most recent deposit market share data from the FDIC, Northrim’s deposit market share in Alaska increased to 15.66% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2024 compared to 15.04% of Alaska's total deposits as of June 30, 2023. This represents 62 basis points of growth in market share percentage for Northrim during that period while, according to the FDIC, the total deposits in Alaska were up 2.3% during the same period. Northrim opened a branch in Kodiak in the first quarter of 2023, a loan production office in Homer in the second quarter of 2023, a permanent branch in Nome in the third quarter of 2023, and a branch in Homer in the first quarter of 2024. See below for further discussion regarding the Company's deposit movement for the quarter.\n\nNorthrim is committed to meeting the needs of the diverse communities in which it operates. As a testament to that support, the Bank has branches in four regions of Alaska identified by the Federal Reserve as 'distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income geographies'.\n\nNet interest income in the Community Banking segment totaled $25.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income increased 7% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 mostly due to higher interest income on loans. This increase was only partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits and borrowings and lower interest income on portfolio investments.\n\nOther operating expenses in the Community Banking segment totaled $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, up $588,000 or 3% from $18.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, and up $2.1 million or 13% from $16.9 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter was mostly due to an increases in salaries and other personnel expense, marketing expense, and professional fees. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter a year ago was primarily due to an increase in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022, as well as increases in salaries and other personnel expense and marketing expense.\n\nThe following tables provide highlights of the Community Banking segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember| March 31,| December| September  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  30, 2024| June 30, 2024| 2024| 31, 2023| 30, 2023  \nNet interest income| $25,901| $24,278| $24,215| $24,456| $24,050  \n(Benefit) provision for credit losses| 1,492| (184)| 197| 885| 1,190  \nOther operating income| 4,540| 3,693| 3,813| 4,048| 3,597  \nOther operating expense| 19,085| 18,497| 17,552| 18,516| 16,946  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 9,864| 9,658| 10,279| 9,103| 9,511  \nProvision for income taxes| 2,316| 2,004| 2,242| 1,941| 1,709  \nNet income| $7,548| $7,654| $8,037| $7,162| $7,802  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,583,055| 5,558,580| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906  \nDiluted earnings per share| $1.34| $1.37| $1.45| $1.29| $1.39  \n  \nYear-to-date  \n---  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nNet interest income| $| 74,394| $| 71,502  \nProvision for credit losses| 1,505| 2,957  \nOther operating income| 12,046| 9,564  \nOther operating expense| 55,134| 52,168  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 29,801| 25,941  \nProvision for income taxes| 6,562| 5,216  \nNet income Community Banking segment| $| 23,239| $| 20,725  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,574,135| 5,688,687  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 4.16| $| 3.64  \n  \n**Home Mortgage****Lending**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, mortgage loans funded for sale increased to $210.0 million, compared to $152.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $131.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Bank purchased Residential Mortgage-originated loans of $38.1 million of which roughly two-thirds were jumbos and one-third were mortgages for second homes, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.59%, up from $29.2 million and 6.82% in the second quarter of 2024, and up from $21.6 million and 6.60% in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in mortgage loans funded for investment has increased net interest income in the Home Mortgage Lending segment. Net interest income contributed $2.9 million to total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, up from $2.8 million in the prior quarter, and up from $2.3 million in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nThe Arizona, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest mortgage expansion markets were responsible for 20% of Residential Mortgage's $248 million total production in the third quarter of 2024, 22% of $182 million total production in the second quarter of 2024, and 8% of $153 million total production in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased mortgage banking income by $968,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a decrease of $81,000 for the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $310,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Mortgage servicing revenue increased to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $2.2 million in the prior quarter and from $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in production of Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) mortgages, which contribute to servicing revenues at origination. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company's servicing portfolio increased $64.8 million, which included $87.3 million in new mortgage loans, net of amortization and payoffs of $22.5 million as compared to a net increase of $41.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $58.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Northrim serviced 4,187 loans in its $1.17 billion home-mortgage-servicing portfolio, a 6% increase compared to the $1.10 billion serviced as of the end of the second quarter of 2024, and a 19% increase from the $982.1 million serviced a year ago.\n\nThe following tables provide highlights of the Home Mortgage Lending segment of Northrim:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember| March 31,| December| September  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  30, 2024| June 30, 2024| 2024| 31, 2023| 30, 2023  \nMortgage commitments| $77,591| $88,006| $56,208| $22,926| $50,128  \nMortgage loans funded for sale| $209,960| $152,339| $84,324| $79,742| $131,863  \nMortgage loans funded for investment| 38,087| 29,175| 17,403| 27,114| 21,585  \nTotal mortgage loans funded| $248,047| $181,514| $101,727| $106,856| $153,448  \nMortgage loan refinances to total fundings| 6| %| 6| %| 4| %| 4| %| 5| %  \nMortgage loans serviced for others| $1,166,585| $1,101,800| $1,060,007| $1,044,516| $982,098  \nNet realized gains on mortgage loans sold| $5,079| $3,188| $1,980| $1,462| $2,491  \nChange in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net| 60| 391| 386| (296| )| (289| )  \nTotal production revenue| 5,139| 3,579| 2,366| 1,166| 2,202  \nMortgage servicing revenue| 2,583| 2,164| 1,561| 2,180| 2,396  \nChange in fair value of mortgage servicing rights:  \nDue to changes in model inputs of assumptions1| (566| )| 239| 289| (707| )| —  \nOther2| (402| )| (320| )| (314| )| (301| )| (310| )  \nTotal mortgage servicing revenue, net| 1,615| 2,083| 1,536| 1,172| 2,086  \nOther mortgage banking revenue| 293| 222| 129| 99| 117  \nTotal mortgage banking income| $7,047| $5,884| $4,031| $2,437| $4,405  \nNet interest income| $2,941| $2,775| $2,232| $2,276| $2,300  \nProvision (benefit) for credit losses| 571| 64| (48| )| —| —  \nMortgage banking income| 7,047| 5,884| 4,031| 2,437| 4,405  \nOther operating expense| 7,643| 6,697| 6,086| 5,477| 5,951  \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes| 1,774| 1,898| 225| (764| )| 754  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| 497| 532| 63| (215| )| 182  \nNet income (loss)| $1,277| $1,366| $162| ($549| )| $572  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,583,055| 5,558,580| 5,554,930| 5,578,491| 5,624,906  \nDiluted earnings per share| $0.23| $0.25| $0.03| ($0.10| )| $0.09  \n  \n1Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates.2Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\n\nYear-to-date  \n---  \n _(Dollars_ _in_ _thousands,_ _except_ _per_ _share_ _data)_|  September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nMortgage loans funded for sale| $446,623| $296,412  \nMortgage loans funded for investment| 84,665| 119,144  \nTotal mortgage loans funded| $531,288| $415,556  \nMortgage loan refinances to total fundings| 6| %| 5| %  \nNet realized gains on mortgage loans sold| $10,247| $6,366  \nChange in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net| 837| 194  \nTotal production revenue| 11,084| 6,560  \nMortgage servicing revenue| 6,308| 5,188  \nChange in fair value of mortgage servicing rights:  \nDue to changes in model inputs of assumptions1| (38| )| (215| )  \nOther2| (1,036| )| (1,464| )  \nTotal mortgage servicing revenue, net| 5,234| 3,509  \nOther mortgage banking revenue| 644| 257  \nTotal mortgage banking income| $16,962| $10,326  \nNet interest income| $7,948| $5,022  \nProvision for credit losses| 587| —  \nMortgage banking income| 16,962| 10,326  \nOther operating expense| 20,426| 18,020  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 3,897| (2,672| )  \nProvision for income taxes| 1,092| (728| )  \nNet (loss) income Home Mortgage Lending segment| $2,805| ($1,944| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted| 5,574,135| 5,688,687  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share| $0.51| ($0.34| )  \n  \n1Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates.2Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\n\n**Balance** **Sheet** **Review**\n\nNorthrim’s total assets were $2.96 billion at September 30, 2024, up 5% from the preceding quarter and up 6% from a year ago. Northrim’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 76% at September 30, 2024, consistent with 76% at June 30, 2024,and up from 71% at September 30, 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, our liquid assets, investments, and loans maturing within one year were $1.07 billion and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $641.7 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets were $2.67 billion in the third quarter of 2024, up 4% from $2.57 billion in the second quarter of 2024 and up 6% from $2.52 billion in the third quarter a year ago. The average yield on interest- earning assets was 5.92% in the third quarter of 2024, up from 5.83% in the preceding quarter and 5.48% in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nAverage investment securities decreased to $619.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $640.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $715.8 million in the third quarter a year ago. The average net tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was 2.80% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 2.82% in the preceding quarter\n\nand up from 2.43% in the year ago quarter. The average estimated duration of the investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, was approximately 2.3 years compared to approximately 2.8 years at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, $105.1 million of available for sale securities with a weighted average yield of 0.61% are scheduled to mature in the next six months, $73.0 million with a weighted average yield of 2.48% are scheduled to mature in six months to one year, and $177.8 million with a weighted average yield of 1.31% are scheduled to mature in the following year, representing a total of $355.9 million or 13% of earning assets that are scheduled to mature in the next 24 months.\n\nTotal unrealized losses, net of tax, on available for sale securities decreased by $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 resulting in total unrealized loss, net of tax, of $7.6 million compared to $15.2 million at June 30, 2024, and $26.5 million a year ago. The average maturity of the available for sale securities with the majority of the unrealized loss is 1.3 years. Total unrealized losses on held to maturity securities were $2.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $4.5 million a year ago.\n\nAverage interest bearing deposits in other banks increased to $28.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and decreased from $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, as deposit balances increased and cash was used to fund the loan growth and provide liquidity.\n\nPortfolio loans were $2.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from the preceding quarter and up 17% from a year ago. Portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, were $1.76 billion at September 30, 2024, up $105.2 million or 6% from the preceding quarter and up 14% from a year ago. This increase was diversified throughout the loan portfolio including commercial real estate nonowner-occupied and multi-family loans increasing by $33.2 million, construction loans increasing by $31.4 million, and commercial real estate owner-occupied loans increasing $29.0 million from the preceding quarter. Average portfolio loans in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.93 billion, which was up 5% from the preceding quarter and up 14% from a year ago. Yields on average portfolio loans in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 6.91% from 6.87% in the second quarter and from 6.61% in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on portfolio loans in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter a year ago is primarily due to loan repricing due to the increases in interest rates and new loans booked at higher rates due to changes in the interest rate environment. The yield on new portfolio loans, excluding consumer mortgage loans, was 7.43% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 8.26% in the second quarter of 2024 and 7.75% in the third quarter of 2023. The drop in yields on new loan production was largely related to the large volume of new commercial real estate versus commercial loans, as noted above, as well as slightly better credit quality of the loans originated in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAlaskans continue to account for substantially all of Northrim’s deposit base. Total deposits were $2.63 billion at September 30, 2024, up 7% from $2.46 billion at June 30, 2024, and up 8% from $2.43 billion a year ago. “The increase in deposits in the third quarter of 2024 were consistent with our customers' business cycles and a result of continued acquisition of new relationships,” said Ballard. At September 30, 2024, 73% of total deposits were held in business accounts and 27% of deposit balances were held in consumer accounts. Northrim had approximately 34,000 deposit customers with an average balance of $48,000 as of September 30, 2024. Northrim had 22 customers with balances over $10 million as of September 30, 2024, which accounted for $978.4 million, or 38%, of total deposits. Demand deposits increased by 8% from the prior quarter and decreased slightly year-over-year to$763.6 million at September 30, 2024. Demand deposits remained consistent at 29% of total deposits at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 down from 31% of total deposits at September 30, 2023. Average interest- bearing deposits were up 4% to $1.80 billion with an average cost of 2.24% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.73 billion and an average cost of 2.21% in the second quarter of 2024, and up 11% compared to $1.62 billion and an average cost of 1.75% in the third quarter of 2023. Uninsured deposits totaled $1.12 billion or 43% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion or 46% of total deposits as of December 31, 2022. Since interest rates began increasing in 2022, Northrim has taken a proactive, targeted approach to increase deposit rates.\n\nShareholders’ equity was $260.1 million, or $47.27 book value per share, at September 30, 2024, compared to $247.2 million, or $44.93 book value per share, at June 30, 2024 and $225.3 million, or $40.60 book value per share, a year ago. Tangible book value per share* was $44.36 at September 30, 2024, compared to $42.03 at June\n\n30, 2024, and $37.72 per share a year ago. The increase in shareholders’ equity in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 was largely the result of earnings of $8.8 million and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio, which increased $7.6 million, net of tax, which were only partially offset by dividends paid of $3.4 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2024 and has 110,000 shares remaining under the current share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. Tangible common equity to tangible assets* was 8.28% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8.24% as of June 30, 2024 and 7.54% as of September 30, 2023. Northrim continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 11.53% at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.68% at June 30, 2024, and 11.67% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Asset** **Quality**\n\nNorthrim believes it has a consistent lending approach throughout economic cycles, which emphasizes appropriate loan-to-value ratios, adequate debt coverage ratios, and competent management.\n\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) net of government guarantees were $5.3 million at September 30, 2024, up from $5.1 million at June 30, 2024 and $5.2 million a year ago. Of the NPAs at September 30, 2024, $3.0 million, or 61%, are nonaccrual loans related to three commercial relationships.\n\nNet adversely classified loans were $6.5 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to $7.1 million at June 30, 2024, and $7.3 million a year ago. Adversely classified loans are loans that Northrim has classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss, net of government guarantees. Net loan recoveries were $96,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loan recoveries of $26,000 in the second quarter of 2024, and net loan recoveries of $96,000 in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, Northrim had 11 loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaling $3.1 million, net of government guarantees in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNorthrim had $127.4 million, or 6% of portfolio loans, in the Healthcare sector, $110.4 million, or 5% of portfolio loans, in the Tourism sector, $96.6 million, or 5% of portfolio loans, in the Accommodations sector, $83.6 million, or 4% of portfolio loans, in the Fishing sector, $70.6 million, or 3% of portfolio loans, in the Aviation (non-tourism) sector, $67.7 million, or 3% of portfolio loans, in the Retail sector, and $53.1 million, or 3% in the Restaurants and Breweries sector as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNorthrim estimates that $82.0 million, or approximately 4% of portfolio loans, had direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, as of September 30, 2024, and $1.6 million of these loans are adversely classified. As of September 30, 2024, Northrim has an additional $29.7 million in unfunded commitments to companies with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, and no unfunded commitments on adversely classified loans. Northrim defines direct exposure to the oil and gas sector as loans to borrowers that provide oilfield services and other companies that have been identified as significantly reliant upon activity in Alaska related to the oil and gas industry, such as lodging, equipment rental, transportation and other logistics services specific to this industry.\n\n**About** **Northrim****BanCorp**\n\nNorthrim BanCorp, Inc. is the parent company of Northrim Bank, an Alaska-based community bank with 20 branches in Anchorage, Eagle River, the Matanuska Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, Juneau, Fairbanks, Nome, Kodiak, Ketchikan, and Sitka, serving 90% of Alaska’s population; and an asset-based lending division in Washington; and a wholly-owned mortgage brokerage company, Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC.

These statements are, in effect, management’s attempt to predict future events, and thus are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s views only as of the date hereof. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, regarding our financial position, business strategy, management’s plans and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” and “intend” and words or phrases of similar meaning, as they relate to Northrim and its management are intended to help identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe that management’s expectations as reflected in forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure readers that those expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements, are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from our expectations as indicated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: potential further increases in interest rates; the value of securities held in our investment portfolio; the impact of the results of government initiatives on the regulatory landscape, natural resource extraction industries, and capital markets; the impact of declines in the value of commercial and residential real estate markets, high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and slowdowns in economic growth; changes in banking regulation or actions by bank regulators; inflation, supply-chain constraints, and potential geopolitical instability, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; financial stress on borrowers (consumers and businesses) as a result of higher rates or an uncertain economic environment; the general condition of, and changes in, the Alaska economy; our ability to maintain or expand our market share or net interest margin; the sufficiency of our provision for credit losses and the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to current expected credit losses accounting guidance; our ability to maintain asset quality; our ability to implement our marketing and growth strategies; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks, including security breaches, “denial of service attacks,” “hacking,” and identity theft; disease outbreaks; and our ability to execute our business plan. Further, actual results may be affected by competition on price and other factors with other financial institutions; customer acceptance of new products and services; the regulatory environment in which we operate; and general trends in the local, regional and national banking industry and economy. In addition, there are risks inherent in the banking industry relating to collectability of loans and changes in interest rates _._ Many of these risks, as well as other risks that may have a material adverse impact on our operations and business, are identified in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and from time to time are disclosed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

events or conditions after the date of this
