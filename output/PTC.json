Our long-term goal remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities,\" said Kristian Talvitie, CFO.\n\nPTC expects to make such repurchases through open market purchases, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans, and may repurchase shares through other methods as well.\n\nThe specific timing and amount of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including PTC's free cash flow, general business and economic conditions, alternative investment opportunities, PTC's stock price, and other considerations. The repurchase authorization may be extended, suspended, or discontinued at any time without prior notice and does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock in any particular period.\n\n**About PTC (NASDAQ: PTC)**\n\nPTC (NASDAQ: PTC) is a global software company that enables industrial and manufacturing companies to digitally transform how they engineer, manufacture, and service the physical products that the world relies on.

Our FY'24 free cash flow was also solid, growing 25% year over year, driven by ARR growth and a disciplined process for incremental investment in our business,\" said Kristian Talvitie, CFO.\n\n\"Given our differentiated product portfolio, the resilience of our subscription business model, the actions we have taken over time to align our investments with market opportunities, and allowing for the potential near-term impacts of our go-to-market changes, we are establishing FY'25 constant currency ARR guidance of 9% to 10% year over year growth. Supported by ARR growth, the predictability of our cash collections, and the disciplined budgeting structure we have in place, we are establishing FY'25 free cash flow guidance of $835 million to $850 million, which absorbs the impact of approximately $20 million of outflows related to our go-to-market realignment. Additionally, as we indicated we would a quarter ago, we are resuming share repurchases, and we currently expect to repurchase approximately $300 million worth of our stock in FY'25, commencing in Q1,\" Talvitie concluded.\n\n**Full Fiscal Year 2025 and First Fiscal Quarter Guidance**\n\n**$ in millions** | **FY'24Actual** | **FY'25Guidance** | **FY'25 YoY GrowthGuidance** | **Q1'25Guidance**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nConstant currency ARR **(FY'25 Plan FX rates 1)** | $2,255 | 9% to 10% growth | 9% to 10% | ~10.5% growth  \nOperating cash flow | $750 | $850 to $8652 | 13% to 15% | ~$2342  \nFree cash flow | $736 | $835 to $8502 | 14% to 16% | ~$2302  \nRevenue | $2,298 | $2,505 to $2,605 | 9% to 13% | $540 to $570  \nEarnings per share | $3.12 | $3.68 to $4.57 | 18% to 47% | $0.28 to $0.52  \nNon-GAAP earnings per share | $5.08 | $5.60 to $6.30 | 10% to 24% | $0.75 to $0.95  \n  \n1 | On a constant currency basis, using our FY'25 Plan foreign exchange rates (rates as of September 30, 2024) for all periods.  \n---|---  \n2 | FY'25 cash flow guidance includes approximately $20 million of outflows related to go-to-market realignment, of which approximately $12 million is expected in Q1'25.  \n  \n**Reconciliation of Operating Cash Flow Guidance to Free Cash Flow Guidance**\n\n**$ in millions** | **FY'25 Guidance** | **Q1'25 Guidance**  \n---|---|---  \nOperating cash flow | $850 to $865 | ~$234  \nCapital expenditures | ~$15 | ~$4  \nFree cash flow | $835 to $850 | ~$230  \n  \n**Reconciliation of EPS Guidance to Non-GAAP EPS Guidance**\n\n**FY'25Guidance** | **Q1'25 Guidance**  \n---|---  \nEarnings per share | $3.68 to $4.57 | $0.28 to $0.52  \nStock-based compensation expense | $1.65 to $1.90 | $0.40 to $0.46  \nIntangible asset amortization expense | ~$0.65 | ~$0.16  \nIncome tax adjustments related to the reconciling items | ($0.63) to ($0.57) | ($0.15) to ($0.13)  \nNon-GAAP Earnings per share | $5.60 to $6.30 | $0.75 to $0.95  \n  \n**FY'25 financial guidance includes the following assumptions:**\n\n  * We provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis, using our FY'25 Plan foreign exchange rates (rates as of September 30, 2024) for all periods.\n  * We expect churn to remain low.\n  * For cash flow, due to invoicing seasonality, and consistent with the past 4 years, we expect the majority of our collections to occur in the first half of our fiscal year and for fiscal Q4 to be our lowest cash flow generation quarter.\n  * Compared to FY'24, at our FY'25 ARR guidance, FY'25 GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase approximately 4% and FY'25 non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase approximately 5%, primarily due to investments to drive future growth and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n  * Cash flow guidance includes approximately $20 million of outflows related to go-to-market realignment.\n  * Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $15 million.\n  * Cash interest payments are expected to be approximately $90 million.\n  * Cash tax payments are expected to be approximately $110 million.\n  * GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be approximately 25%.\n  * GAAP P&L results are expected to include the items below, totaling approximately $279 million to $309 million, as well as their related tax effects:\n    * approximately $200 million to $230 million of stock-based compensation expense, and\n    * approximately $79 million of intangible asset amortization expense.\n  * Our long-term goal, assuming our Debt/EBITDA ratio is below 3x, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\n    * We currently intend to repurchase approximately $300 million of our common stock in FY'25 and retire the $500 million senior notes due in Q2'25.\n    * We currently expect our fully diluted share count to be approximately flat in FY'25.\n\n\n\n**PTC's Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss results at 5:00 pm ET on Wednesday, November 6, 2024.

A replay will also be available.\n\n**Important Information About Our Operating and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nWe provide supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to our financial results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operating performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to GAAP results as the items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures often have a material impact on our operating results, certain of those items are recurring, and others often recur. Management uses, and investors should consider, our non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with our GAAP results.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the effect of the following items: stock-based compensation; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and transaction-related charges included in general and administrative expenses; restructuring and other charges and credits, net; non-operating charges and credits shown in the reconciliation provided; and income tax adjustments. Additional information about the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we exclude them can be found in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Free Cash Flow:** We provide information on free cash flow to enable investors to assess our ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings and to evaluate our performance against our announced long-term goals and intent to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via stock repurchases. Free cash flow is cash provided by (used in) operations net of capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.\n\n**Constant Currency (CC):** We present CC information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To present CC information, FY'24 and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the foreign exchange rate as of September 30, 2023, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. All discussion of FY'25 and comparative prior period ARR results (including FY'24 baseline amounts) are reflected using the foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Operating Measure_**\n\n**ARR:** ARR (Annual Run Rate) represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software, SaaS, hosting, and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period. We calculate ARR as follows:\n\n  * We consider a contract to be active when the product or service contractual term commences (the \"start date\") until the right to use the product or service ends (the \"expiration date\"). Even if the contract with the customer is executed before the start date, the contract will not count toward ARR until the customer right to receive the benefit of the products or services has commenced.\n  * For contracts that include annual values that increase over time as there are additional deliverables in subsequent periods, which we refer to as ramp contracts, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation.\n  * As ARR includes only contracts that are active at the end of the reporting period, ARR does not reflect assumptions or estimates regarding future customer renewals or non-renewals.\n  * Active contracts are annualized by dividing the total active contract value by the contract duration in days (expiration date minus start date), then multiplying that by 365 days (or 366 days for leap years).\n\n\n\nWe believe ARR is a valuable operating measure to assess the health of a subscription business because it is aligned with the amount that we invoice the customer on an annual basis. We invoice customers annually for the current year of the contract. A customer with a one-year contract will typically be invoiced for the total value of the contract at the beginning of the contractual term, while a customer with a multi-year contract will be invoiced for each annual period at the beginning of each year of the contract.\n\nARR increases by the annualized value of active contracts that commence in a reporting period and decreases by the annualized value of contracts that expire in the reporting period.\n\nAs ARR is not annualized recurring revenue, it is not calculated based on recognized or unearned revenue and is not affected by variability in the timing of revenue under ASC 606, particularly for on-premises license subscriptions where a substantial portion of the total value of the contract is recognized at a point in time upon the later of when the software is made available, or the subscription term commences.\n\nARR should be viewed independently of recognized and unearned revenue and is not intended to be combined with, or to replace, either of those items. Investors should consider our ARR operating measure only in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.\n\n**Organic ARR:** We provide an organic ARR measure to help investors understand and assess the performance of our business without the distorting effects of ARR from acquisitions in the comparative period. We do not adjust for acquisitions that have an immaterial impact on our ARR results when providing organic ARR results.\n\n**Organic Constant Currency ARR:** We provide an organic constant currency ARR measure to help investors understand and assess the performance of our business without the distorting effects of ARR from acquisitions in the comparative period and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not adjust for acquisitions that have an immaterial impact on our ARR results when providing organic constant currency ARR results.\n\n**Deferred ARR** : Deferred ARR is ARR attributable to our portfolio of subscription software, cloud, SaaS and support contracts that are not active as of the end of the reporting period but are contractually committed to commence in a future period.\n\nBecause ARR is independent of recognized and unearned revenue, deferred ARR should not be viewed as a measurement of revenue which will be recognized in future periods.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nStatements in this document that are not historic facts, including statements about our future financial and growth expectations and targets, potential stock repurchases and the expected effect of our go-to-market realignment, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include: the macroeconomic and/or global manufacturing climates may not improve or may deteriorate due to, among other factors, high interest rates or increases in interest rates and inflation, volatile foreign exchange rates, tightening of credit standards and availability, the effects of the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and growing tensions with China, any of which could cause customers to delay or reduce purchases of new software, reduce the number of subscriptions they carry, or delay payments to us, which would adversely affect ARR and/or our financial results and cash flow; our investments in our software solutions may not drive expansion of those solutions and/or generate the ARR and/or cash flow we expect if customers are slower to adopt those solutions than we expect or if they adopt competing solutions; our go-to-market realignment and other strategic initiatives to improve organizational and operational efficiency may not do so when or as we expect and may disrupt our business to a greater extent than we expect; other uses of cash or our credit facility limits could limit or preclude the return of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, or could change the amount and timing of any share repurchases; and foreign exchange rates may differ materially from those we expect. In addition, our assumptions concerning our future GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rates are based on estimates and other factors that could change, including changes to tax laws in the U.S. and other countries and the geographic mix of our revenue, expenses, and profits. Other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected are detailed from time to time in reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**About PTC (NASDAQ: PTC)**\n\nPTC (NASDAQ: PTC) is a global software company that enables industrial and manufacturing companies to digitally transform how they engineer, manufacture, and service the physical products that the world relies on.

In FY'23, non-GAAP expense excludes $21.8 million related to uncertain tax positions in a foreign jurisdiction.  \n  \n**PTC Inc.**  \n---  \n**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(in thousands)**  \n**September 30,** | **September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 265,808 | $ | 288,103  \nAccounts receivable, net | 861,953 | 811,398  \nProperty and equipment, net | 75,187 | 88,391  \nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets, net | 4,359,367 | 4,299,760  \nLease assets, net | 133,317 | 143,028  \nOther assets | 687,910 | 658,162  \nTotal assets | $ | 6,383,542 | $ | 6,288,842  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nDeferred revenue | $ | 775,274 | $ | 681,550  \nDebt, net of deferred issuance costs | 1,748,572 | 1,695,785  \nDeferred acquisition payments (1) | - | 620,040  \nLease obligations | 181,754 | 193,192  \nOther liabilities | 463,544 | 420,985  \nStockholders' equity | 3,214,398 | 2,677,290  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity | $ | 6,383,542 | $ | 6,288,842  \n(1) FY'23 Deferred acquisition payments represented the fair value of the $650 million payment associated with the ServiceMax, Inc. acquisition, which was paid in Q1'24.  \n  \n**PTC Inc.**  \n---  \n**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS**  \n**(in thousands)**  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Twelve Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** | **September 30,** | **September 30,** | **September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nCash flows from operating activities:  \nNet income | $ | 126,523 | $ | 45,603 | $ | 376,333 | $ | 245,540  \nStock-based compensation | 62,219 | 58,891 | 223,461 | 206,459  \nDepreciation and amortization | 26,847 | 27,817 | 108,119 | 104,760  \nAmortization of right-of-use lease assets | 10,145 | 7,697 | 33,288 | 32,402  \nOperating lease liability | 193 | (569) | (13,245) | (1,929)  \nAccounts receivable | (166,051) | (198,128) | (34,629) | (98,607)  \nAccounts payable and accruals | (15,999) | 12,395 | (15,964) | 23,763  \nDeferred revenue | 73,006 | 37,876 | 81,399 | 56,572  \nIncome taxes | 27,761 | 31,225 | 25,966 | 21,315  \nOther | (46,530) | 26,962 | (34,744) | 20,586  \nNet cash provided by operating activities | 98,114 | 49,769 | 749,984 | 610,861  \nCapital expenditures | (4,537) | (5,779) | (14,378) | (23,814)  \nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired(1) | - | - | (93,457) | (828,271)  \nBorrowings (payments) on debt, net(2) | (63,125) | (43,000) | 45,924 | 343,000  \nDeferred acquisition payment(3) | - | - | (620,040) | -  \nNet proceeds associated with issuance of common stock | 12,965 | 11,060 | 25,674 | 21,652  \nPayments of withholding taxes in connection with vesting of stock-based awards | (9,412) | (6,959) | (102,001) | (82,448)  \nSettlement of net investment hedges | (16,904) | 6,602 | (13,078) | (7,602)  \nCredit facility origination costs | - | - | - | (13,355)  \nOther financing & investing activities | (4,183) | (1,119) | (4,183) | (6,964)  \nForeign exchange impact on cash | 5,226 | (3,984) | 3,223 | 2,851  \nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | 18,144 | 6,590 | (22,332) | 15,910  \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period | 248,322 | 282,208 | 288,798 | 272,888  \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period | $ | 266,466 | $ | 288,798 | $ | 266,466 | $ | 288,798  \nSupplemental cash flow information:  \nCash paid for interest(3) | $ | 24,641 | $ | 37,855 | $ | 137,036 | $ | 89,801  \n(1) In FY'24, we acquired pure-systems for $93 million, net of cash acquired.

          "content": "PTC ANNOUNCES FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND FULL FISCAL YEAR 2024 RESULTS\nSolid ARR and Cash Flow in Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Full Fiscal Year\nBOSTON, MA, November 6, 2024 - PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) today reported financial results for its fourth\nfiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\n“In fiscal year 2024, we again delivered solid ARR and cash flow, with year-over-year ARR growth in the\nlow double-digits and cash flow growth above 20%. We have a differentiated strategy that leverages\nour unique portfolio to help product companies accelerate their time to market and manage\nincreasing complexity. It’s an exciting time because our products are at the epicenter of driving\nbusiness transformation at our customers,” said Neil Barua, President and CEO, PTC.\n“We continue to focus on increasing customer value while enhancing shareholder returns,” Barua\ncontinued. “Today we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization through the end of\nfiscal 2027. We are also strengthening our ability to scale our business by realigning our go-to-market\norganization to better serve our customers,” concluded Barua.\nFourth Fiscal Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights\nKey operating and financial highlights are set forth below. The definitions of our operating and non-\nGAAP financial measures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP\nmeasures are included below and in the reconciliation tables at the end of this press release.\nQ4’24\n$ in millions Q4’24 Q4'23 YoY Change\nGuidance\nARR as reported $2,255 $1,979 14%\nConstant currency ARR (FY'24 Plan FX rates1) $2,207 $1,979 12% $2,200 to $2,220\nOperating cash flow $98 $50 97% ~$88\nFree cash flow $94 $44 113% ~$83\nRevenue2 $627 $547 15%3 $598 to $648\nOperating margin2 31% 22% 880 bps\nNon-GAAP operating margin2 44% 37% 740 bps\nEarnings per share2 $1.044 $0.384 175% $0.72 to $1.29\nNon-GAAP earnings per share2 $1.545 $1.205 28% $1.30 to $1.66\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $266 $288 (8%)\nGross debt6 $1,753 $2,3227 (25%)\n1 On a constant currency basis, using our FY’24 Plan foreign exchange rates (rates as of September 30, 2023) for all periods.\n2 Revenue and, as a result, operating margin and earnings per share are impacted under ASC 606.\n3 In Q4’24, revenue grew 15% year over year on a constant currency basis.\n4 Q4’24 GAAP EPS included a non-cash tax charge of $9.8 million or $0.08, primarily associated with a reduction in a previously\nrecorded tax benefit associated with the effects of IRS procedural guidance issued in May 2024. Q4’23 GAAP EPS included a\nnon-cash tax charge of $21.8 million or $0.18 per share.\n5 Q4’24 non-GAAP EPS included a non-cash tax charge of $5.3 million or $0.04, primarily associated with a reduction in a\npreviously recorded tax benefit associated with the effects of IRS procedural guidance issued in May 2024.\n6 Gross debt excludes unamortized debt issuance costs.\n7 Q4’23 gross debt included a deferred acquisition payment related to ServiceMax of $620 million, which was paid in October\n2023.\n1\nFY’24\n$ in millions FY’24 FY'23 YoY Change\nGuidance\nOperating cash flow $750 $611 23% ~$740\nFree cash flow $736 $587 25% ~$725\nRevenue1 $2,298 $2,097 10%2 $2,270 to $2,320\nOperating margin1 26% 22% 370 bps\nNon-GAAP operating margin1 39% 36% 270 bps\nEarnings per share1 $3.123 $2.063 51% $2.78 to $3.35\nNon-GAAP earnings per share1 $5.084 $4.344 17% $4.85 to $5.21\n1 Revenue and, as a result, operating margin and earnings per share are impacted under ASC 606.\n2 In FY’24, revenue grew 9% year over year on a constant currency basis.\n3 FY’24 GAAP EPS included a non-cash tax benefit of $4.4 million or $0.04, primarily associated with the effects of IRS procedural\nguidance issued in May 2024. FY’23 GAAP EPS included a non-cash tax charge of $21.8 million or $0.18 per share.\n4 FY’24 non-GAAP EPS included a non-cash tax benefit of $4.4 million or $0.04.\n“In a selling environment that continued to be challenging, our ARR was solid, growing 12% year over\nyear on a constant currency basis. Our FY’24 free cash flow was also solid, growing 25% year over\nyear, driven by ARR growth and a disciplined process for incremental investment in our business,” said\nKristian Talvitie, CFO.\n“Given our differentiated product portfolio, the resilience of our subscription business model, the\nactions we have taken over time to align our investments with market opportunities, and allowing for\nthe potential near-term impacts of our go-to-market changes, we are establishing FY’25 constant\ncurrency ARR guidance of 9% to 10% year over year growth. Supported by ARR growth, the\npredictability of our cash collections, and the disciplined budgeting structure we have in place, we\nare establishing FY’25 free cash flow guidance of $835 million to $850 million, which absorbs the impact\nof approximately $20 million of outflows related to our go-to-market realignment. Additionally, as we\nindicated we would a quarter ago, we are resuming share repurchases, and we currently expect to\nrepurchase approximately $300 million worth of our stock in FY’25, commencing in Q1,” Talvitie\nconcluded.\nFull Fiscal Year 2025 and First Fiscal Quarter Guidance\nFY’25 YoY\nFY’24 FY’25 Q1’25\n$ in millions Growth\nActual Guidance Guidance\nGuidance\n9% to 10%\nConstant currency ARR (FY’25 Plan FX rates1) $2,255 9% to 10% ~10.5% growth\ngrowth\nOperating cash flow $750 $850 to $8652 13% to 15% ~$2342\nFree cash flow $736 $835 to $8502 14% to 16% ~$2302\nRevenue $2,298 $2,505 to $2,605 9% to 13% $540 to $570\nEarnings per share $3.12 $3.68 to $4.57 18% to 47% $0.28 to $0.52\nNon-GAAP earnings per share $5.08 $5.60 to $6.30 10% to 24% $0.75 to $0.95\n1 On a constant currency basis, using our FY’25 Plan foreign exchange rates (rates as of September 30, 2024) for all periods.\n2 FY’25 cash flow guidance includes approximately $20 million of outflows related to go-to-market realignment, of which\napproximately $12 million is expected in Q1’25.\n2\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flow Guidance to Free Cash Flow Guidance\nFY’25 Q1’25\n$ in millions\nGuidance Guidance\nOperating cash flow $850 to $865 ~$234\nCapital expenditures ~$15 ~$4\nFree cash flow $835 to $850 ~$230\nReconciliation of EPS Guidance to Non-GAAP EPS Guidance\nFY’25 Q1’25\nGuidance Guidance\nEarnings per share $3.68 to $4.57 $0.28 to $0.52\nStock-based compensation expense $1.65 to $1.90 $0.40 to $0.46\nIntangible asset amortization expense ~$0.65 ~$0.16\nIncome tax adjustments related to the reconciling items ($0.63) to ($0.57) ($0.15) to ($0.13)\nNon-GAAP Earnings per share $5.60 to $6.30 $0.75 to $0.95\nFY’25 financial guidance includes the following assumptions:\n• We provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis, using our FY’25 Plan foreign exchange\nrates (rates as of September 30, 2024) for all periods.\n• We expect churn to remain low.\n• For cash flow, due to invoicing seasonality, and consistent with the past 4 years, we expect the\nmajority of our collections to occur in the first half of our fiscal year and for fiscal Q4 to be our\nlowest cash flow generation quarter.\n• Compared to FY’24, at our FY’25 ARR guidance, FY’25 GAAP operating expenses are expected\nto increase approximately 4% and FY’25 non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to\nincrease approximately 5%, primarily due to investments to drive future growth and foreign\nexchange rate fluctuations.\n• Cash flow guidance includes approximately $20 million of outflows related to go-to-market\nrealignment.\n• Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $15 million.\n• Cash interest payments are expected to be approximately $90 million.\n• Cash tax payments are expected to be approximately $110 million.\n• GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be approximately 25%.\n• GAAP P&L results are expected to include the items below, totaling approximately $279 million to\n$309 million, as well as their related tax effects:\n• approximately $200 million to $230 million of stock-based compensation expense, and\n• approximately $79 million of intangible asset amortization expense.\n3\n• Our long-term goal, assuming our Debt/EBITDA ratio is below 3x, is to return approximately 50% of\nour free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the\ninterest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\n• We currently intend to repurchase approximately $300 million of our common stock in FY’25\nand retire the $500 million senior notes due in Q2’25.\n• We currently expect our fully diluted share count to be approximately flat in FY’25.\nPTC’s Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss results at 5:00 pm ET on Wednesday, November 6,\n2024.

We use these non-\nGAAP financial measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period\ncomparisons of our operating performance because they provide a view of our operating results\nwithout items that are not, in our view, indicative of our operating results. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be construed as an alternative to GAAP results as the items excluded from the\nnon-GAAP financial measures often have a material impact on our operating results, certain of those\nitems are recurring, and others often recur. Management uses, and investors should consider, our non-\nGAAP financial measures only in conjunction with our GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross\nmargin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the effect of the following items: stock-\nbased compensation; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and transaction-related\ncharges included in general and administrative expenses; restructuring and other charges and credits,\nnet; non-operating charges and credits shown in the reconciliation provided; and income tax\nadjustments. Additional information about the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and the reasons we exclude them can be found in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nFree Cash Flow: We provide information on free cash flow to enable investors to assess our ability to\ngenerate cash without incurring additional external financings and to evaluate our performance\nagainst our announced long-term goals and intent to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow\nto shareholders via stock repurchases. Free cash flow is cash provided by (used in) operations net of\ncapital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.\nConstant Currency (CC): We present CC information to provide a framework for assessing how our\nunderlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nTo present CC information, FY’24 and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in\ncurrencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the foreign\nexchange rate as of September 30, 2023, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that\nperiod. All discussion of FY’25 and comparative prior period ARR results (including FY’24 baseline\namounts) are reflected using the foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2024.\n4\nOperating Measure\nARR: ARR (Annual Run Rate) represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription\nsoftware, SaaS, hosting, and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period. We calculate\nARR as follows:\n• We consider a contract to be active when the product or service contractual term\ncommences (the “start date”) until the right to use the product or service ends (the “expiration\ndate”). Even if the contract with the customer is executed before the start date, the contract\nwill not count toward ARR until the customer right to receive the benefit of the products or\nservices has commenced.\n• For contracts that include annual values that increase over time as there are additional\ndeliverables in subsequent periods, which we refer to as ramp contracts, we include in ARR\nonly the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the\ndate of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract\nvalue as of the date of the ARR calculation.\n• As ARR includes only contracts that are active at the end of the reporting period, ARR does not\nreflect assumptions or estimates regarding future customer renewals or non-renewals.\n• Active contracts are annualized by dividing the total active contract value by the contract\nduration in days (expiration date minus start date), then multiplying that by 365 days (or 366\ndays for leap years).\nWe believe ARR is a valuable operating measure to assess the health of a subscription business\nbecause it is aligned with the amount that we invoice the customer on an annual basis. We invoice\ncustomers annually for the current year of the contract. A customer with a one-year contract will\ntypically be invoiced for the total value of the contract at the beginning of the contractual term, while\na customer with a multi-year contract will be invoiced for each annual period at the beginning of\neach year of the contract.\nARR increases by the annualized value of active contracts that commence in a reporting period and\ndecreases by the annualized value of contracts that expire in the reporting period.\nAs ARR is not annualized recurring revenue, it is not calculated based on recognized or unearned\nrevenue and is not affected by variability in the timing of revenue under ASC 606, particularly for on-\npremises license subscriptions where a substantial portion of the total value of the contract is\nrecognized at a point in time upon the later of when the software is made available, or the\nsubscription term commences.\nARR should be viewed independently of recognized and unearned revenue and is not intended to be\ncombined with, or to replace, either of those items. Investors should consider our ARR operating\nmeasure only in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.\nOrganic ARR: We provide an organic ARR measure to help investors understand and assess the\nperformance of our business without the distorting effects of ARR from acquisitions in the comparative\nperiod. We do not adjust for acquisitions that have an immaterial impact on our ARR results when\nproviding organic ARR results.\nOrganic Constant Currency ARR: We provide an organic constant currency ARR measure to help\ninvestors understand and assess the performance of our business without the distorting effects of ARR\nfrom acquisitions in the comparative period and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not adjust\nfor acquisitions that have an immaterial impact on our ARR results when providing organic constant\ncurrency ARR results.\n5\nDeferred ARR: Deferred ARR is ARR attributable to our portfolio of subscription software, cloud, SaaS\nand support contracts that are not active as of the end of the reporting period but are contractually\ncommitted to commence in a future period.\nBecause ARR is independent of recognized and unearned revenue, deferred ARR should not be\nviewed as a measurement of revenue which will be recognized in future periods.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this document that are not historic facts, including statements about our future financial\nand growth expectations and targets, potential stock repurchases and the expected effect of our go-\nto-market realignment, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could\ncause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include: the macroeconomic\nand/or global manufacturing climates may not improve or may deteriorate due to, among other\nfactors, high interest rates or increases in interest rates and inflation, volatile foreign exchange rates,\ntightening of credit standards and availability, the effects of the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine\nand in the Middle East, and growing tensions with China, any of which could cause customers to\ndelay or reduce purchases of new software, reduce the number of subscriptions they carry, or delay\npayments to us, which would adversely affect ARR and/or our financial results and cash flow; our\ninvestments in our software solutions may not drive expansion of those solutions and/or generate the\nARR and/or cash flow we expect if customers are slower to adopt those solutions than we expect or if\nthey adopt competing solutions; our go-to-market realignment and other strategic initiatives to\nimprove organizational and operational efficiency may not do so when or as we expect and may\ndisrupt our business to a greater extent than we expect; other uses of cash or our credit facility limits\ncould limit or preclude the return of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, or\ncould change the amount and timing of any share repurchases; and foreign exchange rates may\ndiffer materially from those we expect. In addition, our assumptions concerning our future GAAP and\nnon-GAAP effective income tax rates are based on estimates and other factors that could change,\nincluding changes to tax laws in the U.S. and other countries and the geographic mix of our revenue,\nexpenses, and profits.

Demand for their new\nproducts is seeing strong growth. However, their reliance on manual processes within\nengineering and manufacturing significantly limits their ability to keep up with their\nbacklog. They are focused on increasing their production capacity, while continuing to\ndeliver high levels of quality as a regulated company.\nSolution and Impact\nThis customer decided to step up their focus on digital transformation to unlock\nproduction capacity. They are increasing their usage of Windchill PLM and Creo CAD –\nexpanding seats to more users, as well as leveraging more advanced capabilities.\nWindchill’s role will be expanded from traditional product data management to also\nencompass BOM (Bill of Materials) management. Windchill seats will also be expanded\nto 80% of employees, including a majority of people on the manufacturing floor. By\nrelying more on Windchill and streamlining the flow of product data between Windchill and\nother key systems such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and MES (Manufacturing\nExecution System), this customer expects to unlock significant productivity improvements.\nThe new composites module introduced with Creo 10 facilitates the design, simulation,\nand manufacturing of composite parts, and was a catalyst for this customer to upgrade\ntheir Creo capabilities and add additional Creo seats for new product development.\n20\nAPPENDIX: DRIVING GROWTH BY EXTENDING THE DIGITAL\nTHREAD WITH SERVICEMAX AT AN INDUSTRIAL COMPANY\nGoal\nThis customer is a global leader in the cranes industry and has been a large PTC customer\nfor many years, using both Creo CAD and Windchill PLM. However, they currently manage\ntheir field service business using a complex system, comprised of multiple applications from\ndisparate vendors. Their products have long lifecycles, and a top corporate initiative is to\ngrow aftermarket sales and profits.\nSolution and Impact\nAs a large customer of Creo and Windchill, this customer appreciates the value of having\na digital thread that connects product data across design and manufacturing. They now\nwant to extend their digital thread to aftermarket field service. Effective cross-selling\nwas a key part of this deal.\nServiceMax SLM was selected based on product capabilities that are aligned with the\ncustomer’s priority to leverage a digital thread approach as they consolidate their tech stack.\nAfter a thorough assessment process, PTC’s digital thread vision came out on top.\nBy equipping their customer support team with ServiceMax, and enabling visibility to\ninformation in Creo and Windchill, this customer sees potential to drive higher warranty\nrenewal and conversion rates while reducing warranty leakage and concessions.\nWith a digital thread of product data across CAD, PLM, and SLM, remote engineers will be\nable to provide uniquely advanced on-line support to field service technicians.\n21\nAPPENDIX: ACCELERATING TIME TO MARKET WITH MODEL\nBASED DEFINITION (MBD) AT AN INDUSTRIAL COMPANY\nGoal\nThis customer is a global leader in power generation solutions and has been a large PTC\ncustomer for many years, using both Creo CAD and Windchill PLM. To further accelerate\ntime to market, this customer wants to remove bottlenecks between engineering and\nmanufacturing. They want to rely less on disconnected tools and manual processes, and\ninstead leverage their 3D Creo models and Windchill system to a greater extent.\nSolution and Impact\nThis customer is taking a large step forward in their digital transformation journey. They\npurchased additional licenses that enable them to modernize key production processes\nby leveraging the Model Based Definition (MBD) capabilities of Creo and Windchill.\nThe customer’s legacy processes are inefficient and time-consuming: Starting in\nengineering with the 3D model of their product they created in Creo, they arrange views of\ntheir 3D model in a 2D drawing. Next, they annotate the 2D drawing with additional\ninformation required for manufacturing and quality-assurance (QA). Next, they convert the\n2D drawing into a PDF and send the PDF to manufacturing and QA. Finally, they input the\nproduct information from the PDF manually into machines on their manufacturing floor.\nMBD is expected to drive productivity and time to market, because the customer’s\nprocesses will be streamlined and automated: They will add manufacturing and QA\ninformation to their 3D models within Creo, then use their Windchill system to seamlessly\ntransfer the unified product information to downstream manufacturing and QA processes.\n22\nAPPENDIX: DISPLACING A COMPETITOR WITH WINDCHILL+\nSaaS AT A MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY\nGoal\nThis subsidiary of a global industrial conglomerate is a global leader in optical microscopes.\nThey determined their PLM system was no longer adequate to support their business,\ndue to it being a complex system that maintains product data across many separate legacy\nengineering applications and requires high levels of manual data processing.\nSince extensive changes are needed to modernize their PLM system, this customer also\nwants to make the move from on-premises to SaaS at the same time.\nSolution and Impact\nThis customer decided to standardize on PTC for CAD and PLM. They continue to use Creo\nfor product design and will move forward with Windchill+ Select Medical Device for PLM.\nAs a cloud platform specifically for medical device customers, Windchill+ Select Medical\nDevice is expected to fast-track this customer’s digital transformation and ease\nindustry-specific compliance burdens. By streamlining and moving key engineering\nworkflows to Windchill+, this customer sees potential to drive more automation, scale more\neffectively, enable more efficient product development, and further improve quality.\nThis is a competitive displacement, with the first phase focused on establishing a strong\nproduct data foundation and the second phase focused on expanding the use of PLM to\ndrive collaboration across the company. This customer currently has approximately 50\nCreo users and has committed to expand Windchill+ to over 2,500 employees.\n23\nAPPENDIX: CODEBEAMER EXPANSION FOR SOFTWARE\nDEFINED VEHICLES AT LEADING AUTO MANUFACTURERS\nSignificant follow-on expansion deals\nin Q4’24 at 3 global automobile manufacturers\nfor new, committed software defined vehicle\nproduction programs\n2 of which are top 10 automobile\nmanufacturers by revenue\n24\nAPPENDIX: FX IMPACT ON ARR\n$ in millions\nUsing FX rates as of September 30, 2023 (FY'24 Plan FX rates) Q1'23 Q2'23 Q3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24 Q3'24 Q4'24\nConstant Currency ARR by Product Group\nCAD (product data authoring) $ 712 $ 730 $ 7 52 $ 769 $ 785 $ 8 08 $ 824 $ 846\nPLM (product data management and process orchestration) 924 1,119 1 ,153 1 ,209 1 ,231 1,267 1,300 1 ,361\nEnding ARR on a constant currency basis $ 1,636 $ 1,850 $ 1 ,904 $ 1 ,979 $ 2 ,016 $ 2 ,075 $ 2 ,125 $ 2 ,207\nAs reported Q1'23 Q2'23 Q3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24 Q3'24 Q4'24\nARR by Product Group\nCAD (product data authoring) $ 7 27 $ 748 $ 764 $ 769 $ 8 05 $ 8 14 $ 824 $ 8 68\nPLM (product data management and process orchestration) 936 1 ,134 1 ,165 1 ,209 1,252 1 ,275 1 ,302 1,387\nEnding ARR $ 1,663 $ 1,882 $ 1,929 $ 1 ,979 $ 2 ,057 $ 2,088 $ 2,126 $ 2,255\nImpact of FX fluctuations embedded in ARR as reported $ 26 $ 32 $ 24 $ 0 $ 4 1 $ 1 4 $ 2 $ 4 7\nWe report constant currency ARR to help investors understand and assess our business performance excluding FX volatility\n25\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this document that are not historic facts, including statements about our future financial and growth\nexpectations and targets, potential stock repurchases and the expected effect of our go-to-market realignment, are\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those projected. These risks include: the macroeconomic and/or global manufacturing climates may not\nimprove or may deteriorate due to, among other factors, high interest rates or increases in interest rates and inflation,\nvolatile foreign exchange rates, tightening of credit standards and availability, the effects of the conflicts between\nRussia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and growing tensions with China, any of which could cause customers to\ndelay or reduce purchases of new software, reduce the number of subscriptions they carry, or delay payments to us,\nwhich would adversely affect ARR and/or our financial results and cash flow; our investments in our software\nsolutions may not drive expansion of those solutions and/or generate the ARR and/or cash flow we expect if\ncustomers are slower to adopt those solutions than we expect or if they adopt competing solutions; our go-to-\nmarket realignment and other strategic initiatives to improve organizational and operational efficiency may not do so\nwhen or as we expect and may disrupt our business to a greater extent than we expect; other uses of cash or our\ncredit facility limits could limit or preclude the return of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases,\nor could change the amount and timing of any share repurchases; and foreign exchange rates may differ materially\nfrom those we expect. In addition, our assumptions concerning our future GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax\nrates are based on estimates and other factors that could change, including changes to tax laws in the U.S. and other\ncountries and the geographic mix of our revenue, expenses, and profits. Other risks and uncertainties that could\ncause actual results to differ materially from those projected are detailed from time to time in reports we file with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q, and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n26\nOPERATING MEASURE\nARR: ARR (Annual Run Rate) represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software, SaaS, hosting, and\nsupport contracts as of the end of the reporting period. We calculate ARR as follows:\nWe consider a contract to be active when the product or service contractual term commences (the “start date”) until the right to\nuse the product or service ends (the “expiration date”). Even if the contract with the customer is executed before the start date, the\ncontract will not count toward ARR until the customer right to receive the benefit of the products or services has commenced.\nFor contracts that include annual values that increase over time as there are additional deliverables in subsequent periods, which\nwe refer to as ramp contracts, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered\nactive as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date\nof the ARR calculation.\nAs ARR includes only contracts that are active at the end of the reporting period, ARR does not reflect assumptions or estimates\nregarding future customer renewals or non-renewals.\nActive contracts are annualized by dividing the total active contract value by the contract duration in days (expiration date minus\nstart date), then multiplying that by 365 days (or 366 days for leap years).\nWe believe ARR is a valuable operating measure to assess the health of a subscription business because it is aligned with the\namount that we invoice the customer on an annual basis. We invoice customers annually for the current year of the contract. A\ncustomer with a one-year contract will typically be invoiced for the total value of the contract at the beginning of the contractual\nterm, while a customer with a multi-year contract will be invoiced for each annual period at the beginning of each year of the\ncontract.\nARR increases by the annualized value of active contracts that commence in a reporting period and decreases by the annualized\nvalue of contracts that expire in the reporting period.\n27\nOPERATING MEASURE (CONTINUED)\nAs ARR is not annualized recurring revenue, it is not calculated based on recognized or unearned revenue and is not affected by\nvariability in the timing of revenue under ASC 606, particularly for on-premises license subscriptions where a substantial portion of\nthe total value of the contract is recognized at a point in time upon the later of when the software is made available, or the\nsubscription term commences.\nARR should be viewed independently of recognized and unearned revenue and is not intended to be combined with, or to replace,\neither of those items. Investors should consider our ARR operating measure only in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.\nOrganic ARR: We provide an organic ARR measure to help investors understand and assess the performance of our business without\nthe distorting effects of ARR from acquisitions in the comparative period. We do not adjust for acquisitions that have an immaterial\nimpact on our ARR results when providing organic ARR results.\nOrganic Constant Currency ARR: We provide an organic constant currency ARR measure to help investors understand and assess\nthe performance of our business without the distorting effects of ARR from acquisitions in the comparative period and foreign\nexchange rate fluctuations. We do not adjust for acquisitions that have an immaterial impact on our ARR results when providing\norganic constant currency ARR results.\nDeferred ARR: Deferred ARR is ARR attributable to our portfolio of subscription software, cloud, SaaS and support contracts that are\nnot active as of the end of the reporting period but are contractually committed to commence in a future period.\nBecause ARR is independent of recognized and unearned revenue, deferred ARR should not be viewed as a measurement of\nrevenue which will be recognized in future periods.\n28\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nPTC provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to its financial results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures, and we\nbelieve that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operating performance because they provide a\nview of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our operating results. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be construed as an alternative to GAAP results as the items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures\noften have a material impact on our operating results, certain of those items are recurring, and others often recur. Management uses,\nand investors should consider, our non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with our GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income\nand non-GAAP EPS exclude the effect of the following items: stock-based compensation; amortization of acquired intangible assets;\nacquisition and transaction-related charges included in general and administrative expenses; restructuring and other charges, net;\nnon-operating charges and credits shown in the reconciliation provided; and income tax adjustments. Additional information about the\nitems we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we exclude them can be found in “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nFree Cash Flow: PTC provides information on free cash flow to enable investors to assess our ability to generate cash without\nincurring additional external financings and to evaluate our performance against our announced long-term goals and intent to return\napproximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via stock repurchases. Free cash flow is cash provided by (used in)\noperations net of capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.\nConstant Currency (CC): We present CC information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed\nexcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present CC information, FY’24 and comparative prior period results for\nentities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the foreign exchange\nrate as of September 30, 2023, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. All discussion of FY’25 and\ncomparative prior period ARR results (including FY’24 baseline amounts) are reflected using the foreign exchange rates as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n29\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO GAAP\nDiluted earnings per share: GAAP vs. Non-GAAP\nFY’24 FY'25 Guidance Q1'25 Guidance\nDiluted earnings per share $3.12 $3.68 to $4.57 $0.28 to $0.52\nStock-based compensation expense 1.85 1.65 to 1.90 0.40 to 0.46\nIntangible asset amortization expense 0.67 ~0.65 ~0.16\nAcquisition and transaction-related expense 0.03 - -\nRestructuring and other charges (credits) (0.01) - -\nOther non-operating expenses 0.02 - -\nIncome tax adjustments related to the reconciling items (0.59) (0.63) to (0.57) (0.15) to (0.13)\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share $5.08 $5.60 to $6.30 $0.75 to $0.95\nGAAP vs. Non-GAAP Cost of revenue\nIn millions FY'24\nGAAP Cost of revenue $445\nLicense and subscription stock-based compensation expense (0)\nSupport stock-based compensation expense (14)\nProfessional services stock-based compensation expense (7)\nSoftware amortization of acquired intangible assets (38)\nNon-GAAP Cost of revenue $385\nGAAP vs. Non-GAAP Operating Expenses\nIn millions FY'24\nGAAP Operating Expenses $1,266\nStock-based compensation (202)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets (42)\nAcquisition and transaction-related charges (3)\nRestructuring and other credits, net 1\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses $1,019\n30\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO GAAP\nR&D Expense: GAAP vs. Non-GAAP\nIn millions FY'08 FY'09 FY'10 FY'11 FY'12 FY'13 FY'14 FY'15 FY'16\nGAAP research and development expense $182 $189 $202 $211 $215 $222 $226 $228 $229\nStock-based compensation expense (9) (8) (9) (9) (9) (9) (10) (12) (10)\nNon-GAAP research and development expense $173 $180 $192 $203 $206 $213 $216 $216 $219\nIn millions FY'17 FY'18 FY'19 FY'20 FY'21 FY'22 FY'23 FY'24\nGAAP research and development expense $236 $250 $247 $257 $300 $339 $394 $433\nStock-based compensation expense (14) (13) (22) (27) (34) (42) (59) (60)\nNon-GAAP research and development expense $222 $236 $225 $230 $266 $297 $335 $373\nFY'21 to FY'25 Compounded Annual Growth Rate\nSales, Marketing,\nResearch &\nGeneral & Total Operating\nDevelopment\nAdministrative Expense\nExpense\nExpense\nTotal GAAP Expense 12% 3% 6%\nAdjustment for stock-based compensation expense -1% 0% 0%\nAdjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets - - 0%\nAdjustment for acquisition and transaction-related charges - 1% 0%\nAdjustment for restructuring and other credits, net - - 0%\nAdjustment for non-operating charges, net - - 0%\nTotal Non-GAAP Expense 11% 4% 6%\n31\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO GAAP\nFree Cash Flow\nIn millions FY'08 FY'09 FY'10 FY'11 FY'12 FY'13 FY'14 FY'15 FY'16\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $222 $70 $157 $79 $218 $225 $305 $180 $183\nCapital expenditures (25) (30) (27) (28) (31) (29) (25) (31) (26)\nFree cash flow $197 $40 $130 $51 $187 $195 $279 $149 $157\nFY'25\nIn millions FY'17 FY'18 FY'19 FY'20 FY'21 FY'22 FY'23 FY'24\nGuidance\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $135 $248 $285 $234 $369 $435 $611 $750 $850 to $865\nCapital expenditures (25) (36) (64) (20) (25) (19) (24) (14) ~(15)\nFree cash flow $110 $212 $221 $214 $344 $416 $587 $736 $835 to $850\nQ1'25\nIn millions Q4'23 Q4'24\nGuidance\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $50 $98 ~$234\nCapital expenditures (6) (5) ~(4)\nFree cash flow $44 $94 ~$230\n32"
