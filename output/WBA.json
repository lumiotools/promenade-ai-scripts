(Nasdaq: WBA) today announced financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter that ended Aug. 31, 2024.\n\n“Our financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 reflected our disciplined execution on cost management, working capital initiatives and capex reduction. In fiscal 2025, we are focusing on stabilizing the retail pharmacy by optimizing our footprint, controlling operating costs, improving cash flow, and continuing to address reimbursement models to support dispensing margins and preserve patient access for the future,” said Tim Wentworth, Chief Executive Officer, Walgreens Boots Alliance. “Fiscal 2025 will be an important rebasing year as we advance our strategyto drive value creation. This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term.”\n\n#### **Overview of Fourth Quarter Results**\n\nWBA fourth quarter sales increased 6.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $37.5 billion, an increase of 6.1 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting sales growth across all segments.\n\nFourth quarter operating loss was $978 million, an increase of 117.1 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating loss reflects a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to CareCentrix. Adjusted operating income2 was $424 million, a decrease of 37.7 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting softer U.S. retail and pharmacy performance, lapping the reversal of incentive accruals and prior year sale-leaseback gains, partly offset by cost savings initiatives and improved profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment.\n\nNet loss in the fourth quarter was $3.0 billion compared to a net loss of $180 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a higher operating loss, a $2.3 billion non-cash charge for valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to opioid liabilities recognized in prior periods, and a non-cash impairment charge related to equity investment in China. Adjusted net earnings2 decreased 41.0 percent to $340 million, down 40.8 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower adjusted operating income.\n\nLoss per share was $3.48, compared to a loss per share of $0.21 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS2 decreased 41.0 percent to $0.39, reflecting a decrease of 40.8 percent on a constant currency basis.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, a $537 million increase compared with the year-ago quarter, each driven primarily by working capital initiatives and lower legal payments in the current period. Free cash flow also benefited from a $239 million decrease in capital expenditures.\n\n#### **Overview of Fiscal Year Results**\n\nSales in fiscal 2024 were $147.7 billion, an increase of 6.2 percent from the year-ago period, and an increase of 5.7 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting sales growth across all segments.\n\nOperating loss in fiscal 2024 was $14.1 billion, an increase of 104.5 percent compared to the year-ago period. Operating loss in the current period reflects a $12.4 billion non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill, which resulted in a $5.8 billion charge attributable to WBA, net of tax and non-controlling interest. Operating loss in the current period also reflects non-cash impairments charges related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment and CareCentrix goodwill. Prior year operating loss reflects a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation and a $431 million non-cash impairment of pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots UK. Adjusted operating income was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 32.6 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting a challenging U.S. retail environment, net reimbursement pressure, lower sale-leaseback gains and lapping the reversal of incentive accruals in the prior year, partly offset by cost savings and improved profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment.\n\nNet loss in fiscal 2024 was $8.6 billion, an increase of 180.4 percent compared to the year-ago period, primarily driven by a higher operating loss, a $2.2 billion non-cash charge for valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets and a $717 million after-tax charge for fair value adjustments on variable prepaid forward derivatives related to the monetization of Cencora shares. Adjusted net earnings2 were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 27.9 percent on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower adjusted operating income, partly offset by lower interest expense and a lower adjusted effective tax rate due to the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions in the second quarter.\n\nLoss per share for fiscal 2024 was $10.01, an increase of 180.4 percent compared to the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS2 was $2.88, a decrease of 27.6 percent, reflecting a decrease of 27.9 percent on a constant currency basis.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion in fiscal 2024. Free cash flow2 was $23 million, a decrease of $642 million from fiscal 2023, with each driven by lower earnings, higher payments related to legal matters and phasing of working capital. Free cash flow benefited from a $736 million decrease in capital expenditures.\n\n#### **Business Segments**\n\n#### **U.S. Retail Pharmacy**\n\n**Three months ended****August 31****,**| **Twelve months ended****August 31****,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nSales| $| 29,470| $| 27,666| $| 115,778| $| 110,314  \nAdjusted operating income4| $| 220| $| 554| $| 2,167| $| 3,689  \n  \nThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment had fourth quarter sales of $29.5 billion, an increase of 6.5 percent from the year-ago quarter.

Comparable prescriptions, adjusted to 30-day equivalents increased 2.5 percent and comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations increased 2.6 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, increased 1.7 percent to 302 million. Pharmacy margin was negatively impacted by net reimbursement pressure, brand inflation and mix impacts.\n\nRetail sales decreased 3.5 percent and comparable retail sales decreased 1.7 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, reflecting a challenging retail environment and continued channel shift. Retail margin was positively impacted by category mix and higher owned brand penetration, partly offset by elevated shrink levels.\n\nAdjusted operating income4 decreased 60.4 percent to $220 million, reflecting net reimbursement pressure, a $123 million headwind from a prior year incentive accrual release, a $74 million headwind from lower sale-leaseback gains and a challenging retail environment, partly offset by cost savings initiatives.\n\n#### **International**\n\n**Three months ended****August 31****,**| **Twelve months ended****August 31****,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nSales| $| 5,971| $| 5,784| $| 23,552| $| 22,198  \nAdjusted operating income4| $| 231| $| 259| $| 793| $| 935  \n  \nThe International segment had fourth quarter sales of $6.0 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent from the year-ago quarter.

VillageMD sales increased 7.2 percent, reflecting additional risk lives and fee-for-service revenue. Shields grew 27.8 percent, driven by growth within existing partnerships.\n\nOperating loss in the quarter was $526 million compared to $294 million in the prior year period, reflecting the $332 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to CareCentrix. Adjusted operating income4, which excludes certain costs related to stock compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was $17 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $83 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA2 of $65 million improved by $94 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by cost discipline at VillageMD and growth from Shields.\n\n#### **Fiscal 2025 Outlook**\n\n**2025**  \n---  \nSales| $147.0 to $151.0 Billion  \nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure)| $1.6 to $2.0 Billion  \nAdjusted EPS (Non-GAAP measure)| $1.40 to $1.80  \n  \nFor fiscal 2025, Walgreens Boots Alliance expects adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.80 with growth in U.S. Healthcare and International more than offset by decline in U.S. Retail Pharmacy, a higher adjusted effective tax rate, and lower contributions from sale-leaseback and Cencora earnings.\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates to the most directly comparable financial measures on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as unusual one-time charges, tax expenses, and material litigation expenses, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\n#### **Conference Call**\n\nWBA will hold a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 earnings results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, Oct. 15, 2024. A live simulcast as well as related presentation materials will be available through WBA's investor relations website at: [https://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.walgreensbootsalliance.com&esheet=54135950&newsitemid=20241015712623&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.walgreensbootsalliance.com&index=1&md5=bacc57f24fb89c3447716c06cec417cd \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\").

Measures identified as \"comparable\" constitute key performance indicators. See the appendix to this release for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most closely correlated GAAP measure, and key performance indicators.\n\n3 Future expected store closures of approximately 1,200 includes approximately 300 stores previously approved under the Transformational Cost Management Program.\n\n4 The Company uses Adjusted operating income (loss) as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying segment performance and trends. The consolidated WBA measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated operating income.

MEASURES**\n\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. The Company also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a basis for certain compensation programs it sponsors. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as unusual one-time charges, tax expenses, and material litigation expenses, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\n_Constant currency_\n\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n_Comparable sales_\n\nThe twelve months ended August 31, 2024 comparable sales and prescriptions filled figures for the Company exclude the benefit of this year's leap day.\n\nFor the Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments, Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude wholesale sales in Germany and sales from dispositions in the current period. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\n\nWith respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in \"Constant currency\" for further details on constant currency calculations.\n\n_Key Performance Indicators_\n\nThe Company considers certain metrics, such as comparable sales (in constant currency), comparable pharmacy sales (in constant currency), comparable retail sales (in constant currency), comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\n\n**NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE TO ADJUSTED DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE**\n\n**(in millions, except per share amounts)**  \n---  \n**Three months ended****August 31****,**| **Twelve months ended****August 31****,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Net loss attributable to****Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.****(GAAP)**| **$**| **(3,005**| **)**| **$**| **(180**| **)**| **$**| **(8,636**| **)**| **$**| **(3,080**| **)**  \n**Adjustments to operating loss:**  \nImpairment of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets 1| 332| —| 13,422| 299  \nCertain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements 2| 185| 217| 561| 7,466  \nTransformational cost management 3| 489| 485| 891| 1,181  \nAcquisition-related amortization 4| 264| 275| 1,075| 1,126  \nAcquisition-related costs 5| 62| 65| 542| 323  \nAdjustments to equity earnings in Cencora 6| 33| 33| 162| 211  \nLIFO provision 7| 36| 97| 47| 187  \nStore damage and inventory loss insurance recovery 8| —| (40| )| —| (40| )  \nTotal adjustments to operating loss| 1,402| 1,133| 16,701| 10,752  \n**Adjustments to other income, net:**  \nImpairment of equity method investment and investments in debt and equity securities 9| 364| —| 364| —  \nLoss on disposal of business 10| (2| )| 34| 2| 34  \nLoss (gain) on certain non-hedging derivatives 11| 213| (45| )| 946| (19| )  \nGain on investments, net 12| —| (32| )| —| (109| )  \nGain on sale of equity method investment 13| (673| )| (163| )| (1,614| )| (1,855| )  \nTotal adjustments to other income, net| (98| )| (207| )| (301| )| (1,949| )  \n**Adjustments to interest expense, net:**  \nInterest expense on debt 14| 6| —| 19| —  \nTotal adjustments to interest expense, net| 6| —| 19| —  \n**Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit):**  \nEquity method non-cash tax 15| 7| 11| 27| 44  \nDiscrete tax items and tax impact of adjustments 15| 2,036| (219| )| 1,216| (2,187| )  \nTotal adjustments to income tax provision (benefit)| 2,043| (208| )| 1,243| (2,143| )  \n**Adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments:**  \nAdjustments to earnings in other equity method investments 16| 15| 9| 40| 40  \nTotal adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments| 15| 9| 40| 40  \n**Adjustments to net loss attributable to non-controlling interests:**  \nImpairment of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets 1| —| —| (6,195| )| —  \nTransformational cost management 3| 1| —| —| —  \nLoss on disposal of business 10| 1| (14| )| 1| (14| )  \nAcquisition-related costs 5| (17| )| (10| )| (217| )| (80| )  \nDiscrete tax items 15| 37| 108| 37| 108  \nAcquisition-related amortization 4| (48| )| (56| )| (200| )| (196| )  \nTotal adjustments to net loss attributable to non-controlling interests| (25| )| 28| (6,573| )| (182| )  \n**Adjusted net earnings attributable to****Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.****(Non-GAAP measure)**| **$**| **340**| **$**| **575**| **$**| **2,491**| **$**| **3,439**  \n**Diluted net loss per common share (GAAP) 17**| **$**| **(3.48**| **)**| **$**| **(0.21**| **)**| **$**| **(10.01**| **)**| **$**| **(3.57**| **)**  \nAdjustments to operating loss| 1.62| 1.31| 19.32| 12.45  \nAdjustments to other income, net| (0.11| )| (0.24| )| (0.35| )| (2.26| )  \nAdjustments to interest expense, net| 0.01| —| 0.02| —  \nAdjustments to income tax provision (benefit)| 2.36| (0.24| )| 1.44| (2.48| )  \nAdjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments| 0.02| 0.01| 0.05| 0.05  \nAdjustments to net loss attributable to non-controlling interests| (0.03| )| 0.03| (7.61| )| (0.21| )  \n**Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share (Non-GAAP measure) 18**| **$**| **0.39**| **$**| **0.67**| **$**| **2.88**| **$**| **3.98**  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 18| 864.1| 864.3| 864.3| 864.0  \n1| In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded $12.4 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to VillageMD goodwill. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded $332 million of non-cash impairment charges related to CareCentrix goodwill. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses and Impairment of goodwill within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a $431 million impairment of pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots UK of which $132 million was attributed to additional store closures recognized as part of the Transformational Cost Management Program. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance.  \n---|---  \n2| Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded charges related to the opioid litigation Multistate Agreement and certain other legal matters.  \n3| Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.  \n4| Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.  \n5| Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in Operating (loss) income within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock-based compensation, employee transaction success bonuses, and other integration related exit and disposal charges. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.  \n6| Adjustments to equity earnings in Cencora consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by Cencora consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures. Adjustments are recorded to equity earnings in Cencora within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  \n7| The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. These charges are recorded within Cost of sales within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  \n8| Store damage and inventory loss insurance recovery for losses incurred in fiscal 2020 as a result of looting in the U.S. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  \n9| Impairment of equity method investment and investments in debt and equity securities includes impairment of certain investments. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business and it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis. Exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  \n10| Includes gains or losses related to the sale of businesses. These charges are recorded to Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  \n11| Includes fair value gains or losses on the VPF derivatives and certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company does not believe this volatility related to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.  \n12| Includes significant gains resulting from the change in classification of investments as well as the fair value adjustments recorded on investments in equity securities to Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $109 million related to the change in classification of its previously held equity method investment in Option Care Health to an investment in equity security held at fair value and subsequent related fair value adjustments.  \n13| Gains on the sale of equity method investments are recorded in Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business.  \n14| Includes interest expense on external debt to fund incremental contributions to the Boots Plan required to complete the Trustee’s acquisition of a bulk annuity policy (the “Buy-In”) from Legal & General. The payments and related incremental interest expense are not indicative of normal operating performance.  \n15| In fiscal 2024, the Company recorded a $2.2 billion non-cash charge due to recognition of a valuation allowance against certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets primarily related to opioid liabilities recognized in prior periods. Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit) include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision (benefit) commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and UK tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within Income tax provision (benefit) within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  \n16| Adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded in Post-tax earnings from other equity method investments within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.  \n17| Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from periods where the Company reports a net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted net loss per common share.  \n18| Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes.  \n  \n#### **NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS BY SEGMENT**\n\n**(in millions)**  \n---  \n**Three months ended****August 31, 2024**  \n**U.S. Retail Pharmacy**** 1**| **International**| **U.S. Healthcare**| **Corporate and Other**| **Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.**  \nSales| $| 29,470| $| 5,971| $| 2,113| $| (7| )| $| 37,547  \n**Gross profit (GAAP)**| **$**| **4,706**| **$**| **1,305**| **$**| **236**| **$**| **7**| **$**| **6,253**  \nLIFO provision| 36| —| —| —| 36  \nTransformational cost management| 21| 2| —| —| 23  \nAcquisition-related amortization| 6| —| 17| —| 22  \n**Adjusted gross profit (Non-GAAP measure)**| **$**| **4,768**| **$**| **1,307**| **$**| **253**| **$**| **7**| **$**| **6,334**  \n**Selling, general and administrative expenses (GAAP) 3**| **$**| **5,377**| **$**| **1,091**| **$**| **762**| **$**| **50**| **$**| **7,280**  \nTransformational cost management| (452| )| 7| (21| )| —| (467| )  \nImpairment of goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets| —| —| (332| )| —| (332| )  \nAcquisition-related amortization| (101| )| (16| )| (125| )| —| (242| )  \nCertain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements| (185| )| —| —| —| (185| )  \nAcquisition-related costs| (8| )| (6| )| (49| )| 1| (62| )  \n**Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (Non-GAAP measure)**| **$**| **4,631**| **$**| **1,076**| **$**| **236**| **$**| **50**| **$**| **5,992**  \n**Operating (loss) income (GAAP)**| **$**| **(623**| **)**| **$**| **214**| **$**| **(526**| **)**| **$**| **(43**| **)**| **$**| **(978**| **)**  \nTransformational cost management| 473| (5| )| 21| —| 489  \nImpairment of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets| —| —| 332| —| 332  \nAcquisition-related amortization| 107| 16| 142| —| 264  \nCertain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements| 185| —| —| —| 185  \nAcquisition-related costs| 8| 6| 49| (1| )| 62  \nLIFO provision| 36| —| —| —| 36  \nAdjustments to equity earnings in Cencora| 33| —| —| —| 33  \n**Adjusted operating income (loss) (Non-GAAP measure)**| **$**| **220**| **$**| **231**| **$**| **17**| **$**| **(43**| **)**| **$**| **424**  \nGross margin (GAAP)| 16.0| %| 21.9| %| 11.2| %| 16.7| %  \nAdjusted gross margin (Non-GAAP measure)| 16.2| %| 21.9| %| 12.0| %| 16.9| %  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses percent to sales (GAAP) 3| 18.2| %| 18.3| %| 36.1| %| 19.4| %  \nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses percent to sales (Non-GAAP measure)| 15.7| %| 18.0| %| 11.1| %| 16.0| %  \nOperating margin 2| (2.3| )%| 3.6| %| (24.9| )%| (2.7| )%  \nAdjusted operating margin (Non-GAAP measure) 2| 0.5| %| 3.9| %| 0.8| %| 0.9| %  \n1| Operating loss for U.S. Retail Pharmacy includes equity earnings in Cencora.

The Company does not measure Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for its segments.  \n---|---  \n2| In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded $12.4 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to VillageMD goodwill. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded $332 million of non-cash impairment charges related to CareCentrix goodwill. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses and Impairment of goodwill within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance.  \n3| Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.  \n4| Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in Operating (loss) income within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock-based compensation, employee transaction success bonuses, and other integration related exit and disposal charges. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Retail pharmacies are a great example of this,” said Dion Dawson, Founder and Chief Dreamer of Dion’s Chicago Dream. “My vision is that our Dream Vault participants never have to choose between eating healthy and buying their medication, or any other basic need.” \n\nFood insecurity is a serious problem in Gage Park, where [nearly 21%](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ad3731d4bbdb4b95bccf3b90c5a119a6 \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\") of residents lack reliable, consistent access to healthy food (2019 data). \n\nWalgreens installed the Dream Vault on Tuesday, October 22, 2024. Households within a 1-mile radius of the Walgreens store will be invited to participate in the program.\n\n#### **About Walgreens**\n\nWalgreens ([www.walgreens.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walgreens.com&esheet=53990408&newsitemid=20240515511221&lan=en-US&anchor=www.walgreens.com&index=2&md5=d716781cd375b23a5356318ca8cbbe97 \"\\(opens in a new window\\)\")) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

SEP. 16, 2024--On Thanksgiving Day (November 28), most Walgreens locations will be closed, except for 500 Walgreens 24-hour locations, and 300 pharmacies within those locations, that will remain open on Thanksgiving to help meet the healthcare needs of our customers. This is the second year in a row Walgreens has chosen to close its doors on Thanksgiving to allow team members to spend more time with loved ones.“This is just one of the ways we’re acknowledging the dedication of our store team members, pharmacists and pharmacy techs who tirelessly deliver incredible service and patient care every single day,” said Tracey D. Brown, EVP and President, Walgreens Retail & Chief Customer Officer. “We heard incredible feedback from team members about their Thanksgiving holiday last year, so we are excited to extend that tradition once again for them to take a much-deserved break.”\n\nWalgreens team members scheduled to work on Thanksgiving at 24-hour locations are essential in delivering care to their communities, especially during respiratory illness season, and serve as a critical destination for healthcare services, including prescription access, pharmacist advice and medication management.\n\nA small number of Walgreens distribution centers and other sites will also continue to operate on Thanksgiving Day, including supply chain and centralized teams. These team members play an essential role in the company’s readiness to deliver healthcare and convenience for customers and patients leading up to Thanksgiving and through the holiday weekend.\n\nLocations that are closed Thanksgiving Day will operate regular posted hours on Wednesday, Nov. 27 as well as Friday, Nov. 28. Customers are encouraged to check their local store and pharmacy hours using the Walgreens store locator.\n\nWalgreens will be open on Christmas Day (December 25) and New Year’s Day (January 1).\n\n#### **About Walgreens**\n\nWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.
