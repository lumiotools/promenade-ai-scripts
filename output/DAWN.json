(Nasdaq: DAWN) (“Day One” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies for people of all ages with life-threatening diseases, today announced that Samuel Blackman, M.D., Ph.D, co-founder and Head of Research & Development (R&D) of the Company, will be retiring effective at the end of 2024. He will continue to serve as a strategic advisor and consultant while the Company seeks a new Head of R&D.\n\n“Sam’s passion for pediatric oncology and his commitment to our mission is what brought Day One from a seed of an idea to the company it is today,” said Jeremy Bender, chief executive officer of Day One. “We are grateful to Sam for his visionary leadership and relentless pursuit to transform the treatment landscape for children and families impacted by cancer. He has helped lay the foundation for Day One to become a long-term, sustainable enterprise and although we will miss his daily presence, Sam will always be part of the fabric of this company.”\n\nDay One was co-founded in 2018 by Dr. Blackman and Julie Grant of Caanan Partners to identify, acquire, and develop promising new treatments that could address childhood cancers. Under his leadership, the Company acquired tovorafenib in 2019 and developed it through U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in April 2024.\n\n“The creation of Day One, the building of an incredible team with our unique culture, and the development and approval of tovorafenib has been one of the most remarkable and magical experiences of my life. I am, and will always be, profoundly grateful to everyone who has joined, advocated for, and invested in our mission and vision. We started Day One because it was clear that the oncology drug development revolution had left pediatric cancers behind, and that a new model would be required,” said Dr. Blackman. “Part of what we’ve illustrated at Day One is you can do good for children and their families and be a successful company at the same time. We have created a sustainable company with global reach and impact, and I have unending confidence in the company’s ability to grow its pipeline and continue to advance new drugs forward for years to come.”\n\nDay One’s Chief Medical Officer, Elly Barry, M.D., will lead the clinical and medical teams while the Company searches for its new Head of R&D.\n\n**About Day One Biopharmaceuticals** Day One Biopharmaceuticals believes when it comes to pediatric cancer, we can do better. The Company was founded to address a critical unmet need: the dire lack of therapeutic development in pediatric cancer. Inspired by “The Day One Talk” that physicians have with patients and their families about an initial cancer diagnosis and treatment plan, Day One aims to re-envision cancer drug development and redefine what’s possible for all people living with cancer—regardless of age—starting from Day One.\n\nDay One partners with leading clinical oncologists, families, and scientists to identify, acquire, and develop important targeted cancer treatments. The Company’s pipeline includes tovorafenib (OJEMDA™), DAY301 and a VRK1 inhibitor program.\n\nDay One is based in Brisbane, California.

(Nasdaq: DAWN) (“Day One” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies for people of all ages with life-threatening diseases, today announced its third quarter 2024 financial results and highlighted recent corporate achievements.\n\n“Our third quarter results demonstrate continued patient demand for OJEMDA, driven by the need for new therapies for children living with pediatric low-grade glioma,” said Jeremy Bender, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Day One. “Looking ahead to 2025, we plan to continue to drive growth by advancing our programs and pipeline, including DAY301, a potential first-in-class ADC targeting PTK7 that we expect to be in the clinic in the coming months.”\n\n**Program****Highlights**\n\n  * Strong growth in OJEMDA net revenue with $20.1M in the third quarter of 2024, representing a 145% increase over the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Quarterly prescriptions (TRx) grew to 619 in the third quarter of 2024, representing a 159% increase over the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Day One expects to dose the first patient in the Phase 1a portion of the Phase 1a/b clinical trial of DAY301 by the end of 2024 or in the first quarter of 2025.\n  * Day One provided updated duration of response data from the registrational Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial investigating tovorafenib in patients with BRAF-altered, relapsed or progressive pLGG. For the 77 patients enrolled on Arm 1, which was the dataset used to assess OJEMDA’s efficacy, the median duration of response is 18 months.\n  * The pivotal Phase 3 FIREFLY-2/LOGGIC clinical trial evaluating tovorafenib as a front-line therapy in patients aged 6 months to 25 years with pLGG continues to enroll patients in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and Asia, with more than 100 sites activated.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Highlights and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Day One and Ipsen entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to commercialize tovorafenib outside of the U.S. in July 2024. Under the agreement, Day One received approximately $111 million upfront in cash and equity investment at a premium with up to approximately $350 million in additional launch and sales milestone payments as well as tiered double-digit royalties starting at mid-teens percentage on net sales.\n  * Day One entered into a definitive agreement for an oversubscribed private placement of its securities for total gross proceeds of approximately $175 million in July 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Product Revenue, Net:** OJEMDA net product revenues were $20.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, the first full quarter of the U.S. launch.\n  * **License Revenue:** License revenue from the sale of ex-U.S. commercial rights for tovorafenib was $73.7 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **R &D Expenses: **Research and development expenses were $33.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $33.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the clinical trial activities related to tovorafenib and additional employee compensation costs.\n  * **SG &A Expenses: **Selling, general and administrative expenses were $29.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $18.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to employee compensation costs, commercial launch activities, and professional service expenses to support the launch of OJEMDA.\n  * **Net Income/Loss:** Net income totaled $37.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 with non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $11.6 million, compared to a net loss of $46.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, with non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $9.6 million.\n  * **Cash Position:** The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $558.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Events**\n\n  * Two posters on health-related quality of life and drug holiday from the registrational Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial investigating tovorafenib in patients with BRAF-altered, relapsed or progressive pLGG will be presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology Annual Meeting on November 22, 2024.\n  * Piper Sandler 36th Annual Healthcare Conference, December 3-5, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nDay One will host a conference call and webcast today, October 30 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).\n\nTovorafenib was granted Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the FDA for the treatment of patients with pLGG harboring an activating RAF alteration, and it was evaluated by the FDA under priority review. Tovorafenib has also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of malignant glioma and from the European Commission for the treatment of glioma.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.ojemda.com.\n\n**About Day One Biopharmaceuticals** Day One Biopharmaceuticals believes when it comes to pediatric cancer, we can do better.
