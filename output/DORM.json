(the “Company” or “Dorman”) (NASDAQ: DORM), a leading supplier in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\nKevin Olsen, Dorman’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We delivered strong performance in the third quarter with earnings growth exceeding our expectations. Light Duty drove mid-single digit net sales growth, as our innovation strategy continues to bolster Dorman’s leading portfolio of aftermarket solutions. While net sales were down in our Heavy Duty segment and flat in our Specialty Vehicle segment, both delivered solid topline results when considering the headwinds that persisted in each sector throughout the quarter. Each of our businesses continues to execute exceptionally well against our operational excellence initiatives. These efforts are enabling streamlined workflows, quicker speeds to market, and increased profitability across the enterprise.\n\n“With three quarters of strong financial results, coupled with our positive outlook and visibility through the balance of the year, we are updating our full-year net sales and EPS growth guidance. For 2024, we now anticipate net sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We are also increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance and now expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.25 and adjusted diluted EPS* to be in the range of $6.85 to $6.95.\n\n“We are pleased with our results through the third quarter and look forward to delivering solid sales and earnings growth for the year. Our performance is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our Contributors, the strength of our customer relationships, and our unwavering commitment to driving innovation for our end users.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results** The Company reported third-quarter 2024 net sales of $503.8 million, up 3.2% compared to net sales of $488.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit was $203.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 40.5% of net sales, compared to $183.2 million, or 37.5% of net sales, for the same quarter last year.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $124.5 million, or 24.7% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $119.0 million, or 24.4% of net sales, for the same quarter last year. Adjusted SG&A expenses* were $117.9 million, or 23.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $114.1 million, or 23.4% of net sales, in the same quarter last year.\n\nDiluted EPS was $1.80 in the third quarter of 2024, up 41% compared to diluted EPS of $1.28 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted EPS* was $1.96 in the third quarter of 2024, up 40% compared to adjusted diluted EPS* of $1.40 in the same quarter last year.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company generated $44 million in cash from operating activities, invested $9 million in capital expenditures, repaid $11 million of debt and returned $27 million to shareholders through stock repurchases.\n\nSegment results were as follows:\n\n**Net Sales**| **Segment Profit Margin**  \n---|---  \n($ in millions)| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **Change**| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **Change**  \n**Light Duty**|  $| 393.6| $| 374.7| 5| %| 19.0| %| 16.1| %| 290 bps  \n**Heavy Duty**|  59.6| 62.8| -5| %| 4.5| %| 3.0| %| 150 bps  \n**Specialty Vehicle**|  50.6| 50.6| 0| %| 17.0| %| 13.5| %| 350 bps  \n  \n**2024 Guidance** The Company updated its full-year 2024 guidance, detailed in the table below, which excludes any potential impacts from future acquisitions and divestitures, supply chain disruptions, significant inflation, interest rate changes and additional share repurchases.\n\nUpdated 2024 Guidance| Prior 2024 Guidance  \n---|---  \nNet Sales Growth vs. 2023| 3.5% – 4.5%| 3% – 5%  \nDiluted EPS| $6.15 – $6.25| $5.32 – $5.52  \nGrowth vs. 2023| 50% – 52%| 30% – 35%  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS*| $6.85 – $6.95| $6.00 – $6.20  \nGrowth vs. 2023| 51% – 53%| 32% – 37%  \nTax Rate Estimate| 24%| 24%  \n  \n**Share Repurchase Program** Dorman repurchased 273,653 shares of its common stock for $26.7 million at an average share price of $97.70 during the quarter ended September 28, 2024.

Under this program, share repurchases may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, share availability and other factors at the Company’s discretion. The prior share repurchase plan and any amounts that remain available for purchases under that plan will expire on December 31, 2024.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** The Company will hold a conference call and webcast for investors on Friday, November 1, 2024 beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on those forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements were made. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors (many of which are outside of our control). Such risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among other things: competition in and the evolution of the motor vehicle aftermarket industry; changes in our relationships with, or the loss of, any customers or suppliers; our ability to develop, market and sell new and existing products; our ability to anticipate and meet customer demand; our ability to purchase necessary materials from our suppliers and the impacts of any related logistics constraints; widespread public health pandemics; political and regulatory matters, such as changes in trade policy, the imposition of tariffs and climate regulation; our ability to protect our information security systems and defend against cyberattacks; our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against any claims of infringement; and financial and economic factors, such as our level of indebtedness, fluctuations in interest rates and inflation. More information on these risks and other potential factors that could affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price is included in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.

The expense was $1.8 million pretax (or $1.4 million after tax) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.[4] – Fair value adjustments to contingent consideration represents the change to our estimates of ultimate earnout payment amounts for a previously completed acquisition based on projections of financial performance compared to the target amounts defined in the purchase agreement and totaled $1.0 million pretax (or $0.8 million after tax) and $13.4 million pretax (or $10.2 million after tax) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.[5] – Pretax reduction in workforce costs represents costs incurred in connection with our planned workforce reduction including severance and other payroll-related costs insurance continuation costs, modifications of share-based compensation awards, and other costs directly attributable to the action. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the expense was $0.1 million pretax (or $0.1 million after tax) and $4.9 million pretax (or $3.7 million after tax), respectively.[6] – Tax adjustments represent the aggregate tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments reflected in the table above and totaled $(1.7) million and $(5.8) million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and $(1.2) million and $(4.9) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

(NASDAQ:DORM) is announcing the release of hundreds of new aftermarket components and assemblies, adding to its expansive catalog of more than 133,000 SKUs. Several of these new offerings represent aftermarket exclusives, first-to-aftermarket solutions that help keep vehicles on the road for everyday drivers while providing millions of repair opportunities for parts distributors, retailers and repair shops.\n\nDesigned to offer a better repair solution than the OEM, the following Dorman® OE FIX™ products were released:\n\n  * An exhaust manifold repair clamp that saves time and labor on repairs to certain General Motors and Isuzu vehicles. When an exhaust manifold fastener breaks, the clamp offers an alternative to fixing the manifold to the cylinder head without needing to extract the broken stud.\n  * A transmission gearshift bracket designed to match the fit of the original part, but manufactured from a higher grade, more durable aluminum alloy, and engineered with a much sturdier double-bolt design that more effectively and consistently distributes the stresses of changing gears. Offers a hassle-free and predictable repair when the column-mounted shift lever on certain Dodge and Ram trucks becomes sloppy or inoperable. Also includes a direct replacement shift interlock solenoid.\n  * A flexible braided stainless steel fuel line made with stainless steel over flexible PTFE tubing, specific length for select Chevrolet, Pontiac and Buick vehicles. Original-style hard fuel lines can be tough to route under the vehicle, while this OE FIX offers new brackets and factory connectors designed to offer the easiest possible installation.\n\n\n\nAdditional noteworthy innovations for October include:\n\n  * A loaded brake backing plate, a pre-assembled solution for select Ford vehicles, designed to save time and labor, as well as provide structure for the other components in the braking system while also helping to keep debris from entering.\n  * A turbocharger inlet duct and charge air cooler pipe for popular Ram trucks, adding to Dorman’s diverse array of critical turbocharger accessories. Designed to match the performance of the original lines, these cost-effective replacements help remedy leaking or failed original lines.\n  * Precision-engineered and manufactured to match the performance of the factory manifold on specified Ford Transit vans, exhaust manifold kits resist warping, cracking and leaking for long-lasting performance.\n  * A back-up sensor for select Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram vehicles, a reliable replacement for an original part that has failed due to fatigue or electrical malfunction.\n  * An engine heater hose assembly for specified Ford Super Duty trucks, precision-manufactured to match the performance of the original equipment hose which failed due to heat and fatigue.\n  * An engine valve cover manufactured from quality materials to withstand extreme temperatures to resist leaking for certain Infiniti and Nissan models.\n\n\n\nIn total, these featured product solutions offer more than 18 million new repair opportunities, giving repair professionals, enthusiasts and owners greater freedom to fix motor vehicles.\n\nFind Dorman products near you using the [Where to Buy](https://www.dormanproducts.com/pages/wheretobuy/dorman.aspx) search tool or take the Dorman Virtual Tour at [DormanProducts.com/tour](http://DormanProducts.com/tour) to learn more about the company, including history, culture and more.\n\n**Contacts**\n\n  * **Marketing:** Steve Gisondi, Vice President of Marketing, sgisondi@dormanproducts.com\n  * **Investor Relations****:** Alex Whitelam, Vice President, Investor Relations & Risk Management, awhitelam@dormanproducts.com\n\n\n\nVisit our website at [www.dormanproducts.com](http://www.dormanproducts.com).

Commitments and Contingencies\nAcquisitions\nWe have contingent consideration related to acquisitions due to the uncertainty of the ultimate\namount of any payments that will become due as earnout payments if performance targets are\nachieved. If the remaining performance targets for the acquisitions are fully achieved, the maximum\nadditional contingent payments to be made under the transaction documents would be $102.0 million\nin aggregate.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimated that no such contingent\npayments are expected to become due in connection with the acquisitions, and therefore accrued no\nliability.\nThe contingent consideration liability is measured each reporting period and recorded at fair\nvalue. The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are\nconsidered to be Level 3 inputs due to the lack of relevant observable market activity and significant\nmanagement judgment. The approach to valuing the contingent consideration uses unobservable\nfactors such as projected revenues and cost of goods sold over the term of the earnout period,\ndiscounted for the period over which the contingent consideration is measured, and volatility rates.\nBased upon these assumptions, the contingent consideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation. An increase in future revenue and gross profit may result in a higher estimated fair value,\nwhile a decrease in future revenue and gross profit may result in a lower estimated fair value of the\ncontingent consideration liability.\nOther Contingencies\nWe are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, such as various claims and legal actions involving contracts, employment claims,\ncompetitive practices, intellectual property infringement, product liability claims and other matters\narising out of the conduct of our business. In the opinion of management, none of the actions,\nindividually or in the aggregate, taking into account relevant insurance coverage, would likely have a\nmaterial financial impact on the Company and we believe the range of reasonably possible losses from\ncurrent matters, taking into account relevant insurance coverage, is immaterial. However, legal matters\nare subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of any\nof these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s cash flows, financial position\nor results of operations in the period in which any such effects are recorded.\n8. Stock-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)\nWe grant RSUs, and prior to January 2020 we granted RSAs, to participants in our equity plans.\nPerformance-based RSUs granted in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 included certain\ngrants that vest based on our total shareholder return ranking relative to the Nasdaq US Benchmark\nAuto Parts Index over a three-year performance period (market condition), and other grants that vest\nbased upon achievement of return on invested capital targets over a three-year performance period\n(performance condition).\nCompensation cost related to RSA and RSU grants was $3.4 million and $2.4 million for the\nthree months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $9.1 million and\n$6.7 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and\nwas included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our RSA and RSU activity for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nShares Fair Value\nBalance at December 31, 2023 257,554 $ 97.33\nGranted 187,645 $ 98.95\nVested (72,701) $ 89.90\nCanceled (28,792) $ 112.06\nBalance at September 28, 2024 343,706 $ 98.56\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we granted 32,109 performance-based RSUs\ncontaining a market condition with a grant date fair value of $138.58 per share. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, we granted 29,399 performance-based RSUs containing a market\ncondition with a grant date fair value of $113.15 per share.\nAs of September 28, 2024, there was $21.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to\nunvested RSA and RSU grants that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1\nyears.\nStock Options\nFrom time to time, we grant stock options to participants in our equity plans. Compensation cost\nrelated to stock option grants was $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $1.1 million and $1.5 million for the\nnine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and was included as\nselling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage Aggregate\nWeighted Remaining Intrinsic\nAverage Term Value\nShares Price (years) (in thousands)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 311,217 $ 86.52\nCanceled (10,936) $ 95.80\nExercised (25,580) $ 72.88\nBalance at September 28, 2024 274,701 $ 87.42 4.7 $ 7,187\nExercisable at September 28, 2024 174,775 $ 83.34 4.1 $ 5,284\nAs of September 28, 2024, there was $2.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to\nunvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\")\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we issued 13,555 shares under the ESPP.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 14,975 shares under the ESPP.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share was calculated by dividing our net income by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested RSAs which are\nconsidered to be contingently issuable. To calculate diluted earnings per share, common share\nequivalents are added to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Common share\n11\nTable of Contents\nequivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and are computed based on outstanding\nstock-based awards.\nFor the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were\napproximately 214,000 shares and 294,000 shares, respectively, and for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 there were approximately 253,000 shares and 295,000\nshares, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because\ntheir effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings\nper share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands, except per share data) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet income $ 55,253 $ 40,522 $ 135,491 $ 78,975\nDenominator:\nWeighted average basic shares outstanding 30,570 31,483 30,888 31,462\nEffect of stock-based compensation awards 169 71 131 78\nWeighted average diluted shares\noutstanding 30,739 31,555 31,019 31,540\nEarnings Per Share:\nBasic $ 1.81 $ 1.29 $ 4.39 $ 2.51\nDiluted $ 1.80 $ 1.28 $ 4.37 $ 2.50\n10. Common Stock Repurchases\nWe periodically repurchase, at the then current market price, and cancel common stock issued to\nthe Dorman Products, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan and Trust (the “401(k) Plan”). 401(k) Plan\nparticipants can no longer purchase shares of Dorman common stock as an investment option under\nthe 401(k) Plan. Shares are generally purchased by the Company from the 401(k) Plan when\nparticipants sell units as permitted by the 401(k) Plan or elect to leave the 401(k) Plan upon retirement,\ntermination or other reasons. The following table summarizes the repurchase and cancellation of\ncommon stock by the Company for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nShares repurchased and canceled 2,410 2,010 11,414 11,850\nTotal cost of shares repurchased and canceled\n(in thousands) $ 262 $ 181 $ 1,048 $ 1,009\nAverage price per share $ 108.70 $ 89.99 $ 91.85 $ 85.11\nSeparately, our Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $600 million of\nour common stock through December 31, 2024 under a share repurchase program and subsequent\nauthorizations (the “Existing Program”). At September 28, 2024, $134.6 million was available for\nrepurchase under the Existing Program. The Existing Program will expire on December 31, 2024,\nalong with all amounts that remain available for use under the Existing Program as of that date.\nIn October 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to\n$500 million of our common stock under a new share repurchase program that is effective from\nJanuary 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027 (the “New Program”).\nUnder each of the Existing Program and the New Program, share repurchases may be made from\ntime to time depending on market conditions, share price, share availability and other factors at the\n12\nTable of Contents\nCompany’s discretion. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific\nnumber of shares.\nThe following table summarizes the repurchase and cancellation of common stock under the\nExisting Program:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nShares repurchased and canceled 273,653 — 855,971 —\nTotal cost of shares repurchased and canceled\n(in thousands) $ 26,737 $ — $ 78,091 $ —\nAverage price per share $ 97.70 $ — $ 91.23 $ —\n11. Income Taxes\nAt September 28, 2024, we had $3.4 million of net unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would\nlower our effective tax rate if recognized. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are\nrecognized in income tax expense and were not material as of September 28, 2024.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States, Canada, China, India, and Mexico. The statute of\nlimitations for tax years before 2020 is closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The statute of\nlimitations for tax years before 2017 is closed for the states in which we filed. The statute of\nlimitations for tax years before 2021 is closed for income tax purposes in Canada and China. The\nstatute of limitations for tax years before 2020 is closed for income tax purposes in India. The statute\nof limitations for tax years before 2019 is closed for income tax purposes in Mexico.\n12. Related-Party Transactions\nPrior to December 1, 2023, we leased our Colmar, PA facility from an entity in which Steven\nBerman, our Non-Executive Chairman, and certain of his family members are owners. On December\n1, 2023, the Colmar facility was sold to a third party, subject to our lease. We also lease a portion of\nour Lewisberry, PA facility from an entity in which Mr. Berman and certain of his family members are\nowners. The Colmar lease was, and the Lewisberry lease is, a non-cancelable operating lease. The\nLewisberry lease expires December 31, 2027.\nWe also lease our facilities in Madison, IN and Shreveport, LA, from entities in which Lindsay\nHunt, our President, Specialty Vehicle, and certain of her family members are owners. Each lease is a\nnon-cancelable operating lease, was renewed in October 2022 in connection with the acquisition of\nSuper ATV, LLC, a leading supplier to the powersports aftermarket (\"SuperATV\"), and will expire on\nOctober 31, 2027.\nWe have service agreements with counterparties that are majority-owned by a family member of\nMs. Hunt. These agreements provide for various warehouse and facility-related services at agreed-\nupon rates.\nThe following table represents the estimated payments for the year ending December 31, 2024\nand actual payments for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the related party agreements\ndescribed above:\nYear Ending Year Ended\n(in thousands) December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFacility leases with Steven Berman related entities $ 715 $ 2,918\nFacility leases with Lindsay Hunt related entities $ 2,757 $ 2,603\nService agreements with Lindsay Hunt related entities $ 54 $ 200\n13\nTable of Contents\nWe are a partner in a joint venture with one of our suppliers and own a minority interest in two\nother suppliers. Two of these investments are accounted for under the equity method and one is\naccounted for under the cost method.\n13. Fair Value Disclosures\nThe carrying value of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair value based\non the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of borrowings under our credit\nfacility approximates fair value because these borrowings bear interest at rates indexed to a market rate\n(Term SOFR).\n14. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting\nStandards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU\nrequires additional disclosures about reportable segments’ significant expenses on an interim and\nannual basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\nThe ASU expands disclosures in the income tax rate reconciliations table and cash taxes paid and is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\nWe expect to implement these new standards by their effective dates, and do not expect their\nadoption to have an impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n14\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2.

Financial Statements”\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations and the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes\nthereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains the registered and unregistered trademarks or\nservice marks of Dorman and are the property of Dorman Products, Inc. and/or its affiliates. This\n15\nTable of Contents\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q also may contain additional trade names, trademarks or service marks\nbelonging to other companies. We do not intend our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, trade\nnames or service marks to imply, and such use or display should not be construed to imply, a\nrelationship with or endorsement or sponsorship of us by these parties.\nOverview\nWe are one of the leading suppliers of replacement and upgrade parts in the motor vehicle\naftermarket industry, serving passenger cars, light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks, as well as\nspecialty vehicles, including utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). We\noperate through three business segments: Light Duty, Heavy Duty, and Specialty Vehicle, consistent\nwith the sectors of the motor vehicle aftermarket industry in which we operate. For more information\non our segments, refer to Note 8, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements,\nincluded under Part II, ITEM 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we marketed approximately 133,000 distinct parts compared to\napproximately 129,000 as of December 31, 2022, many of which we designed and engineered. This\nnumber excludes private label stock keeping units and other variations in how we market, package and\ndistribute our products, includes distinct parts of acquired companies and reflects distinct parts that\nhave been discontinued at the end of their lifecycle. Our products are sold under our various brand\nnames, under our customers’ private label brands or in bulk. We are one of the leading aftermarket\nsuppliers of parts that were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment, or OE,\nmanufacturers or salvage yards. These parts include, among other parts, leaf springs, intake manifolds,\nexhaust manifolds, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust\ngas recirculation (EGR) coolers, UTV windshields, and complex electronics modules.\nWe generate most of our net sales from customers in North America, primarily in the United\nStates. Our products are sold primarily through aftermarket retailers; through online platforms;\ndealers; national, regional and local warehouse distributors and specialty markets; and salvage yards.\nWe also distribute aftermarket parts outside the United States, with sales primarily into Canada and\nMexico, and to a lesser extent, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations\ndue to the timing of orders placed by our customers as well as our ability, and the ability of our\nsuppliers, to deliver products ordered by our customers. The introduction of new products and product\nlines to customers, as well as business acquisitions, may also cause significant fluctuations from\nquarter to quarter.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies as described\nin the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNew Product Development\nNew product development is an important success factor for us and has been a source of our\ngrowth. We have made incremental investments to increase our new product development efforts to\ngrow our business and strengthen our relationships with our customers. The investments primarily\nhave been in the form of increased product development resources, increased customer and end-user\nawareness programs, and customer service improvements. These investments historically have enabled\nus to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow revenues at levels that generally\nhave exceeded market growth rates.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we introduced 4,498 new distinct parts to our\ncustomers and end-users, including 1,374 “New-to-the-Aftermarket” parts. We introduced 6,106 new\ndistinct parts to our customers and end-users in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including\n1,791 “New-to-the-Aftermarket” parts.\nOne area of focus for the light-duty sector has been our complex electronics program, which\ncapitalizes on the growing number of electronic components being utilized on today’s OE platforms.\nNew vehicles contain an average of approximately 100 electronic modules, with some high-end luxury\nvehicles exceeding that. Our complex electronics products are designed and developed in-house and\ntested to help ensure consistent performance, and our product portfolio is focused on further\ndeveloping our leadership position in the category.\nAnother area of focus has been on products we market for the heavy-duty sector. We believe that\nthis sector provides many of the same growth opportunities that the light-duty sector has provided us.\nWe specialize in offering parts to this sector that were traditionally only available from OE\nmanufacturers or salvage yards, similar to how we approach the light-duty sector.\nWithin the specialty vehicle sector, we focus on providing performance parts and accessories,\nand nondiscretionary repair parts for UTVs and ATVs. We develop products designed to be\ncompatible across a wide variety of makes and models to enhance both the performance and\nappearance of customers’ vehicles.\nAcquisitions\nA key component of our strategy is growth through acquisitions, including the October 2022\nacquisition of SuperATV and the August 2021 acquisition of Dayton Parts. SuperATV is a leading\nindependent supplier to the powersports aftermarket with a family of highly respected brands spanning\nfunctional accessories and upgrades, as well as replacement parts for specialty vehicles. Dayton Parts\nis a manufacturer of chassis and other parts designed to serve the heavy-duty vehicle sector of the\naftermarket. We may acquire businesses in the future to supplement our financial growth, increase our\ncustomer base, add to our distribution capabilities or enhance our product development resources,\namong other reasons.\nIndustry Factors\nThe Company’s financial results are also impacted by various industry factors, including, but not\nlimited to the number, age and condition of vehicles in operation at any one time, and the miles driven\nby those vehicles.\nVehicles in Operation\nThe Company’s products are primarily purchased and installed on a subsegment of the passenger\nand light-duty vehicles in operation in the United States (“VIO”), specifically weighted towards\nvehicles aged 8-to-13 years old. Each year, the United States seasonally adjusted annual rate (“US\nSAAR”) of new vehicles purchased adds a new year to the VIO. According to data from the Auto Care\nAssociation (“Auto Care”), the US SAAR experienced a decline from 2008 to 2011 as consumers\npurchased fewer new vehicles as a result of the Great Recession of 2008. We believe that the declining\nUS SAAR during that period resulted in a follow-on decline in our primary VIO subsegment (8-to 13-\nyear-old vehicles) commencing in 2016. However, following 2011 and the impact of the Great\nRecession of 2008, U.S. consumers began to increase their purchases of new vehicles which over time\ncaused the US SAAR to recover and return to more historical levels. The 8-to-13-year-old vehicle car\nparc has continued to grow over the past several years, which we expect will expand demand for\naftermarket replacement parts as more vehicles remain in operation.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we believe that vehicle owners generally are operating their current vehicles longer\nthan they did several years ago, performing necessary repairs and maintenance to keep those vehicles\nwell maintained. We believe this trend has supported an increase in VIO, which increased to 295.9\nmillion in 2023, a 1% increase over 2022. According to data published by Polk, a division of IHS\nAutomotive, the average age of VIO increased to 12.6 years as of October 2023 from 12.4 years as of\nOctober 2022.\nMiles Driven\nThe number of miles driven is another important statistic that impacts our business. Generally, as\nvehicles are driven more miles, the more likely it is that parts will fail and there will be increased\ndemand for replacement parts, including our parts. According to the U.S. Department of\nTransportation, the number of miles driven through October 2023 increased 2.1% year over year in the\nlight-duty sector. However, global gasoline prices remained high during fiscal 2023 and, if they\ncontinue, they may negatively impact miles driven as consumers reduce travel or seek alternative\nmethods of transportation.\nBrand Protection\nWe operate in a highly competitive market. As a result, we are continuously evaluating our\napproach to brand, pricing and terms to our different customers and channels. For example, we\nmaintain brand protection policies, which are designed to ensure that certain of our branded products\nare not advertised below certain approved pricing levels. In addition, we may pursue legal remedies\nwhen we see third parties violating our intellectual property rights, including those that violate our\npatents, wrongfully represent our products as their own or use our product images for their own\nmarketing efforts.\nDiscounts, Allowances and Incentives\nWe offer a variety of customer discounts, rebates, defective and slow-moving product returns\nand other incentives. We may offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified\ndiscount terms of the invoice. In addition, we may offer pricing discounts based on volume purchased\nfrom us or other pricing discounts related to programs under a customer’s agreement. These incentives\ncan be in the form of “off-invoice” discounts that are immediately deducted from sales at the time of\nsale. For those customers that choose to receive their incentives on a quarterly or annual basis instead\nof “off-invoice,” we provide rebates and accrue for such incentives as the related sales are made and\nreduce sales accordingly. Finally, rebates and discounts are provided to customers to support\npromotional activities such as advertising and sales force allowances.\nOur customers, particularly our larger retail customers, regularly seek more favorable pricing and\nproduct return provisions, and extended payment terms when negotiating with us. We attempt to avoid\nor minimize these concessions as much as possible, but we have granted pricing concessions,\nindemnification rights and extended customer payment terms, and allowed a higher level of product\nreturns in certain cases. These concessions impact net sales as well as our profit levels and may require\nadditional capital to finance the business. We expect our customers to continue to exert pressure on\nour margins.\nWe may incur change-over costs to induce a customer to switch from a competitor’s brand.\nThese costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred.\nProduct Warranty and Overstock Returns\nWe warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as\ndesigned on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on\n18\nTable of Contents\nmost of our products in the light-duty parts categories, with more limited warranties for our heavy-\nduty and specialty vehicle products. In addition to warranty returns, we may permit our customers to\nreturn new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits if they have overstocked their\ninventories. At the time products are sold, we accrue a liability for product warranties and overstock\nreturns as a percentage of sales based upon estimates established using historical information on the\nnature, frequency and average cost of the claim and the probability of the customer return. Significant\njudgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and\nother allowances in any accounting period. Revisions to these estimates are made when necessary,\nbased upon changes in these factors. We regularly study trends of such claims.\nForeign Currency\nMany of our products and related raw materials and components are purchased from suppliers in\na variety of non-U.S. countries. The products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the\npurchase price specified in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we generally do not have exposure to\nfluctuations in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies between the\ntime of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product.\nTo the extent that the U.S. dollar changes in value relative to those foreign currencies in the\nfuture, the prices charged by our suppliers for goods under new purchase orders may change in\nequivalent U.S. dollars. The largest portion of our overseas purchases comes from China. The Chinese\nyuan to U.S. dollar exchange rate has fluctuated over the past several years. Any future changes in the\nvalue of the Chinese yuan relative to the U.S. dollar may result in a change in the cost of goods that we\npurchase from China. However, the cost of the goods we procure is also affected by other factors,\nincluding raw material availability, labor costs, tariffs and transportation costs.\nWe have operations located outside the United States with various functional currencies. Because\nour consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, the assets, liabilities, net sales,\nand expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar must be converted into U.S.\ndollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates may impact our financial results.\nImpact of Labor Market and Inflationary Costs\nWe experienced broad-based inflationary impacts during the year ended December 31, 2023,\nnotably in the first six months of the year, due primarily to global transportation and logistics\nconstraints, which resulted in significantly higher transportation costs; tariffs; material costs; and wage\ninflation from an increasingly competitive labor market. Uncertain global supply chain and logistics\nstability driven by geopolitical events, higher labor costs and material inflation costs may negatively\nimpact our results in the future. We attempt to offset inflationary pressures with cost-saving initiatives,\nprice increases to customers and the use of alternative suppliers. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be successful in implementing pricing increases in the future to recover increased inflationary\ncosts.\nImpact of Interest Rates\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our customer accounts receivable\nsales programs, as a change in the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) or\nalternative discount rate affects the cost incurred to factor eligible accounts receivable. Additionally,\nour outstanding borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates tied to Term SOFR\nor the applicable base rate. Under the terms of the credit facility, a change in interest rates affects the\nrate at which we can borrow funds thereunder and also impacts the interest cost on existing\nborrowings. Interest rates may hold steady at their current rates for prolonged periods or may increase\n19\nTable of Contents\nin the future, resulting in increased costs associated with our accounts receivable sales programs and\noutstanding borrowings. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we saw significant increases in\nTerm SOFR and other reference rates. Interest rates remained elevated throughout the first nine\nmonths of 2024 but have shown recent signs of beginning to decline.\nImpact of Tariffs\nIn the third quarter of 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) began\nimposing additional tariffs on products imported from China, including many of our products, ranging\nfrom 7.5% to 25%. The tariffs enacted to date increase the cost of many of the products that are\nmanufactured for us in China. We have taken several actions to mitigate the impact of the tariffs\nincluding, but not limited to, price increases to our customers and cost concessions from our suppliers.\nWe expect to continue mitigating the impact of tariffs primarily through, among other things,\ndiversification of suppliers across geographies and selling price increases to offset the higher tariffs\nincurred.\nIn March 2022, the USTR reinstated tariff relief for certain categories of products imported from\nChina that had expired. Absent further action by the USTR, the reinstated tariff relief will expire on\nMay 31, 2025. The reinstated tariff relief applies to a limited number of our products and is not\nexpected to materially impact our operating results.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of net sales represented\nby certain items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThree Months Ended* Nine Months Ended*\n(in thousands, except percentage data) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet sales $ 503,773 100.0 % $ 488,186 100.0 % $ 1,475,425 100.0 % $ 1,435,492 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 299,970 59.5 % 304,968 62.5 % 890,775 60.4 % 944,291 65.8 %\nGross profit 203,803 40.5 % 183,218 37.5 % 584,650 39.6 % 491,201 34.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 124,532 24.7 % 119,010 24.4 % 378,489 25.7 % 353,681 24.6 %\nIncome from operations 79,271 15.7 % 64,208 13.2 % 206,161 14.0 % 137,520 9.6 %\nInterest expense, net 9,762 1.9 % 12,215 2.5 % 30,569 2.1 % 36,733 2.6 %\nOther income, net 1,615 0.3 % 605 0.1 % 1,711 0.1 % 1,358 0.1 %\nIncome before income taxes 71,124 14.1 % 52,598 10.8 % 177,303 12.0 % 102,145 7.1 %\nProvision for income taxes 15,871 3.2 % 12,076 2.5 % 41,812 2.8 % 23,170 1.6 %\nNet income $ 55,253 11.0 % $ 40,522 8.3 % $ 135,491 9.2 % $ 78,975 5.5 %\n*Percentage of sales information may not add due to rounding\nThree Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,\n2023\nNet sales increased $15.6 million, or 3.2%, for the three months ended September 28, 2024\ncompared to the prior year period, driven primarily by increased customer demand and sales of new\nproducts launched in our Light Duty segment, partially offset by soft market conditions in the heavy\nduty and specialty vehicle sectors.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 300 basis points compared to the prior year\nperiod primarily due to the easing of inflationary pressures across the businesses and favorable mix\nfrom higher sales of new products, as well as operational efficiency initiatives delivering cost-savings.\n20\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $5.5 million, or 30 basis\npoints as a percentage of net sales, for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the\nprior year period due to higher compensation and benefits costs. In the prior year period, SG&A\nbenefited from a $1.0 million fair value adjustment to the estimated contingent consideration related to\na prior acquisition.\nOur effective tax rate decreased to 22.3% for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from\n23.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to favorable discrete items in the three\nmonths ended September 28, 2024.\nNine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet sales increased $39.9 million, or 2.8%, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024\ncompared to the prior year period, driven primarily by volume, including from new product\nintroductions.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 540 basis points compared to the prior year\nperiod primarily due to sales of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $24.8 million, or 110 basis\npoints as a percentage of net sales, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the\nprior year period, primarily due to $13.4 million of favorable fair value adjustments in the prior year\nperiod to the estimated contingent consideration obligation for an acquisition and higher compensation\nand benefits costs in the current year period.\nOur effective tax rate increased to 23.6% for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from\n22.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to favorable discrete items applied\nto a lower income before income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n21\nTable of Contents\nSegment Operating Results\nSegment operating results were as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet Sales:\nLight Duty $ 393,577 $ 374,697 $ 1,138,228 $ 1,076,619\nHeavy Duty 59,615 62,841 178,613 199,495\nSpecialty Vehicle 50,581 50,648 158,584 159,378\nTotal $ 503,773 $ 488,186 $ 1,475,425 $ 1,435,492\nSegment profit:\nLight Duty $ 74,632 $ 60,457 $ 198,339 $ 122,917\nHeavy Duty 2,660 1,861 5,390 10,595\nSpecialty Vehicle 8,624 6,840 25,823 23,625\nTotal $ 85,916 $ 69,158 $ 229,552 $ 157,137\nThree Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,\n2023\nLight Duty\nLight Duty net sales increased $18.9 million, or 5.0%, for the three months ended September 28,\n2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer demand and sales of new\nproducts launched.\nLight Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.0% for the three months\nended September 28, 2024, from 16.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase\nwas primarily driven by the easing of inflationary pressures, favorable mix driven by higher new\nproduct sales, and operational excellence initiatives delivering cost-savings, partially offset by higher\ncompensation and benefits costs.\nHeavy Duty\nHeavy Duty net sales decreased $3.2 million, or 5.1%, for the three months ended September 28,\n2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net sales primarily reflects reduced customer\ndemand from lower freight industry shipping volumes, partially offset by sales of new products in the\nthree months ended September 28, 2024.\nHeavy Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased 150 basis points for the three\nmonths ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily\ndriven by sales of lower-cost inventory, and the impact of investments we made as part of initiatives to\ngrow sales and improve margins on a long-term basis.\nSpecialty Vehicle\nSpecialty Vehicle net sales remained flat for the three months ended September 28, 2024,\ncompared to the prior year period.\nSpecialty Vehicle segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.0% from 13.5% for\nthe three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. This increase was\nprimarily driven by sales of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives.\n22\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nLight Duty\nLight Duty net sales increased $61.6 million, or 5.7%, for the nine months ended September 28,\n2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to volume increases, including sales of new\nproducts launched.\nLight Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.4% for the nine months\nended September 28, 2024, from 11.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase\nwas primarily driven by the sell-through of lower-cost inventory and operational excellence initiatives\ndelivering cost-savings, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs.\nHeavy Duty\nHeavy Duty net sales decreased $20.9 million, or 10.5%, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net sales primarily reflects\nreduced customer demand from lower freight industry shipping volumes in the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024, as well as sales performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2023\ndriven by customers’ inventory restocking at the end of the global pandemic.\nHeavy Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 230 basis points for the nine\nmonths ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily\ndriven by the deleveraging of fixed costs on lower net sales and the impact of investments we made as\npart of initiatives to grow sales and improve margins on a long-term basis.\nSpecialty Vehicle\nSpecialty Vehicle net sales remained relatively flat for the nine months ended September 28,\n2024, compared to the prior year period.\nSpecialty Vehicle segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.3% for the nine\nmonths ended September 28, 2024, from 14.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\nincrease was primarily driven by the sell-through of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity have been our invested cash and the cash flow we\ngenerate from our operations, including accounts receivable sales programs facilitated through certain\ncustomers. Key components of our liquidity and capital resources were as follows:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 45,127 $ 36,814\nWorking Capital $ 754,753 $ 686,558\nShareholders' equity $ 1,234,602 $ 1,168,203\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate\nto meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our liquidity could be\nnegatively affected by extending payment terms to customers, a decrease in demand for our products,\nhigher interest rates, the outcome of contingencies or other factors. See Note 7, “Commitments and\nContingencies”, in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding commitments and contingencies that may affect our liquidity.\n23\nTable of Contents\nPayment Terms and Accounts Receivable Sales Programs\nOver the past several years, we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a\nresult of customer requests and market demands. These extended terms have resulted in increased\naccounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash. Where available and when we deem\nappropriate, we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers that allow us\nto sell our accounts receivable to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these\npayment term extensions. However, any sales of accounts receivable through these programs\nultimately result in us receiving a lesser amount of cash upfront than if we collected those accounts\nreceivable ourselves in due course, resulting in accounts receivable factoring costs. Moreover, since\nthese accounts receivable sales programs bear interest at rates tied to the Term SOFR or other\nreference rates, increases in these applicable rates increase our cost to sell our receivables and reduce\nthe amount of cash we receive. See PART I, ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about\nMarket Risk for more information. Further extensions of customer payment terms would result in\nadditional uses of cash or increased costs associated with the sales of accounts receivable.\nSales of accounts receivable under these programs, and related factoring costs were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSales of accounts receivable $ 254,657 $ 233,513 $ 791,413 $ 713,190\nFactoring costs 11,939 12,255 38,171 37,674\nIf receivables had not been sold over the previous twelve months, approximately $557.7 million\nand $526.4 million of additional accounts receivable would have been outstanding at September 28,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, based on our standard payment terms. We had capacity to\nsell more accounts receivable under these programs if the needs of the business warranted.\nCredit Agreement\nThe Company has a credit agreement that provides a $600.0 million revolving credit facility and\nalso includes a $500.0 million term loan with quarterly amortization payment requirements. The credit\nagreement matures on October 4, 2027. As of September 28, 2024, there was $61.8 million in\noutstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $475.0 million in outstanding\nborrowings under the term loan. Also on that date, we had outstanding letters of credit for $1.2 million\nin aggregate. Net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, we had $537.0 million available\nunder the credit facility at September 28, 2024.\nOur credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 28, 2024, we\nwere not in default with respect to our credit agreement.\nRefer to Note 7, “Long-Term Debt” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained\nin PART II, ITEM 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, for additional information.\n24\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes the activities included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash provided by operating activities $ 159,622 $ 149,110\nCash used in investing activities (31,245) (32,869)\nCash used in financing activities (120,033) (130,305)\nEffect of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents (31) (17)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 8,313 $ (14,081)\nFor the nine months ended September 28, 2024, cash provided by operating activities increased\n$10.5 million over the prior year period, primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by\nfavorable working capital in the prior year period from significant inventory reductions.\nInvesting activities used cash of $31.2 million and $32.9 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing\nactivities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period is\nprimarily due to higher additions for property, plant and equipment in the prior year period.\nFinancing activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 included $78.1 million\npaid to repurchase 855,971 shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan, and the\nrepayments of $31.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $9.4\nmillion of our term loan balance under our credit agreement. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we repaid $119.7 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit\nfacility and $9.4 million of our term loan balance under our credit agreement. The remaining uses of\ncash from financing activities in each period resulted primarily from the repurchase of our common\nstock from our 401(k) Plan and income tax withholding in connection with the vesting of restricted\nstock awards (“RSAs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”).\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. Accounts\nreceivable factored under our customer-sponsored accounts receivable sales programs bear interest at\nrates tied to Term SOFR or alternative discount rates and result in us incurring costs as those accounts\nreceivable are factored. Additionally, interest expense from our variable rate debt is impacted by\nreference rates.\nUnder the terms of our customer-sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable, a change in the\nreference rate would affect the amount of financing costs we incur, and the amount of cash we receive\nupon the sales of accounts receivable under these programs. A one-percentage-point increase in Term\nSOFR or the discount rates on the accounts receivable sales programs would have increased our\nfactoring costs and reduced the amount of cash we would have received by approximately $2.0 million\nfor both the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and $6.3 million and\n$6.0 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nUnder the terms of our credit agreement, a change in the reference rate or the lender’s base rate\nwould affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder. A one-percentage-point increase in\nthe reference rate or base rate would have increased our interest expense on our variable rate debt\nunder our credit agreement by approximately $1.4 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended\n25\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $4.2 million and $5.3 million for the\nnine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the\nend of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e), were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act), that occurred during the three months ended September 28, 2024 that\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nControl systems, no matter how well-conceived and operated, are designed to provide a\nreasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the\nbenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations\nin a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe Company conducts periodic evaluations of its internal controls to enhance, where necessary, its\nprocedures and controls.\n26\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

(the “Company” or “Dorman”) (NASDAQ: DORM), a leading supplier in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\nKevin Olsen, Dorman’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We delivered strong performance in the third quarter with earnings growth exceeding our expectations. Light Duty drove mid-single digit net sales growth, as our innovation strategy continues to bolster Dorman’s leading portfolio of aftermarket solutions. While net sales were down in our Heavy Duty segment and flat in our Specialty Vehicle segment, both delivered solid topline results when considering the headwinds that persisted in each sector throughout the quarter. Each of our businesses continues to execute exceptionally well against our operational excellence initiatives. These efforts are enabling streamlined workflows, quicker speeds to market, and increased profitability across the enterprise.\n\n“With three quarters of strong financial results, coupled with our positive outlook and visibility through the balance of the year, we are updating our full-year net sales and EPS growth guidance. For 2024, we now anticipate net sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We are also increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance and now expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.25 and adjusted diluted EPS* to be in the range of $6.85 to $6.95.\n\n“We are pleased with our results through the third quarter and look forward to delivering solid sales and earnings growth for the year. Our performance is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our Contributors, the strength of our customer relationships, and our unwavering commitment to driving innovation for our end users.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results** The Company reported third-quarter 2024 net sales of $503.8 million, up 3.2% compared to net sales of $488.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit was $203.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 40.5% of net sales, compared to $183.2 million, or 37.5% of net sales, for the same quarter last year.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $124.5 million, or 24.7% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $119.0 million, or 24.4% of net sales, for the same quarter last year. Adjusted SG&A expenses* were $117.9 million, or 23.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $114.1 million, or 23.4% of net sales, in the same quarter last year.\n\nDiluted EPS was $1.80 in the third quarter of 2024, up 41% compared to diluted EPS of $1.28 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted EPS* was $1.96 in the third quarter of 2024, up 40% compared to adjusted diluted EPS* of $1.40 in the same quarter last year.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company generated $44 million in cash from operating activities, invested $9 million in capital expenditures, repaid $11 million of debt and returned $27 million to shareholders through stock repurchases.\n\nSegment results were as follows:\n\n**Net Sales**| **Segment Profit Margin**  \n---|---  \n($ in millions)| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **Change**| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **Change**  \n**Light Duty**|  $| 393.6| $| 374.7| 5| %| 19.0| %| 16.1| %| 290 bps  \n**Heavy Duty**|  59.6| 62.8| -5| %| 4.5| %| 3.0| %| 150 bps  \n**Specialty Vehicle**|  50.6| 50.6| 0| %| 17.0| %| 13.5| %| 350 bps  \n  \n**2024 Guidance** The Company updated its full-year 2024 guidance, detailed in the table below, which excludes any potential impacts from future acquisitions and divestitures, supply chain disruptions, significant inflation, interest rate changes and additional share repurchases.\n\nUpdated 2024 Guidance| Prior 2024 Guidance  \n---|---  \nNet Sales Growth vs. 2023| 3.5% – 4.5%| 3% – 5%  \nDiluted EPS| $6.15 – $6.25| $5.32 – $5.52  \nGrowth vs. 2023| 50% – 52%| 30% – 35%  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS*| $6.85 – $6.95| $6.00 – $6.20  \nGrowth vs. 2023| 51% – 53%| 32% – 37%  \nTax Rate Estimate| 24%| 24%  \n  \n**Share Repurchase Program** Dorman repurchased 273,653 shares of its common stock for $26.7 million at an average share price of $97.70 during the quarter ended September 28, 2024.

Non-GAAP financial measures may reflect adjustments for charges such as fair value adjustments, amortization, transaction costs, severance, accelerated depreciation, and other similar expenses related to acquisitions as well as other items that we believe are not related to our ongoing performance.  \n**Adjusted Net Income:**  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**(unaudited)**|  9/28/24*| 9/30/23*| 9/28/24*| 9/30/23*  \nNet income (GAAP)| $| 55,253| $| 40,522| $| 135,491| $| 78,975  \nPretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [1]| 6,173| 5,485| 17,138| 16,336  \nPretax acquisition-related transaction and other costs [2]| 396| 465| 1,327| 14,880  \nPretax executive transition services expense [3]| —| —| —| 1,801  \nPretax fair value adjustment to contingent consideration [4]| —| (1,000| )| —| (13,400| )  \nPretax reduction in workforce costs [5]| 76| —| 4,926| —  \nTax adjustment (related to above items) [6]| (1,654| )| (1,214| )| (5,815| )| (4,891| )  \nAdjusted net income (Non-GAAP)| $| 60,244| $| 44,258| $| 153,067| $| 93,701  \nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP)| $| 1.80| $| 1.28| $| 4.37| $| 2.50  \nPretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [1]| 0.20| 0.17| 0.55| 0.52  \nPretax acquisition-related transaction and other costs [2]| 0.01| 0.01| 0.04| 0.47  \nPretax executive transition services expense [3]| —| —| —| 0.06  \nPretax fair value adjustment to contingent consideration [4]| —| (0.03| )| —| (0.42| )  \nPretax reduction in workforce costs [5]| 0.00| —| 0.16| —  \nTax adjustment (related to above items) [6]| (0.05| )| (0.04| )| (0.19| )| (0.16| )  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP)| $| 1.96| $| 1.40| $| 4.93| $| 2.97  \nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding| 30,739| 31,555| 31,019| 31,540  \n* Amounts may not add due to rounding.See accompanying notes at the end of this supplemental schedule.  \n**Adjusted Gross Profit:**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Three Months Ended**  \n**(unaudited)**|  9/28/24| Pct.**| 9/30/23| Pct.**  \nGross profit (GAAP)| $| 203,803| 40.5| $| 183,218| 37.5  \nPretax acquisition-related transaction and other costs [2]| 1| 0.0| 6| 0.0  \nAdjusted gross profit (Non-GAAP)| $| 203,804| 40.5| $| 183,224| 37.5  \nNet sales| $| 503,773| $| 488,186  \n**Nine Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**(unaudited)**|  9/28/24| Pct.**| 9/30/23| Pct.**  \nGross profit (GAAP)| $| 584,650| 39.6| $| 491,201| 34.2  \nPretax acquisition-related transaction and other costs [2]| 11| 0.0| 11,806| 0.8  \nAdjusted gross profit (Non-GAAP)| $| 584,661| 39.6| $| 503,007| 35.0  \nNet sales| $| 1,475,425| $| 1,435,492  \n**Adjusted SG &A Expenses:**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Three Months Ended**  \n**(unaudited)**|  9/28/24| Pct.**| 9/30/23| Pct.**  \nSG&A expenses (GAAP)| $| 124,532| 24.7| $| 119,010| 24.4  \nPretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [1]| (6,173| )| (1.2| )| (5,485| )| (1.1| )  \nPretax acquisition-related transaction and other costs [2]| (395| )| (0.1| )| (459| )| (0.1| )  \nPretax fair value adjustment to contingent consideration [4]| —| —| 1,000| 0.2  \nPretax reduction in workforce costs [5]| (76| )| (0.0| )| —| —  \nAdjusted SG&A expenses (Non-GAAP)| $| 117,888| 23.4| $| 114,066| 23.4  \nNet sales| $| 503,773| $| 488,186  \n**Nine Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**(unaudited)**|  9/28/24| Pct.**| 9/30/23| Pct.**  \nSG&A expenses (GAAP)| $| 378,489| 25.7| $| 353,681| 24.6  \nPretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [1]| (17,138| )| (1.2| )| (16,336| )| (1.1| )  \nPretax acquisition-related transaction and other costs [2]| (1,316| )| (0.1| )| (3,074| )| (0.2| )  \nExecutive transition services expense [3]| —| —| (1,801| )| (0.1| )  \nPretax fair value adjustment to contingent consideration [4]| —| —| 13,400| 0.9  \nPretax reduction in workforce costs [5]| (4,926| )| (0.3| )| —| —  \nAdjusted SG&A expenses (Non-GAAP)| $| 355,109| 24.1| $| 345,870| 24.1  \nNet sales| $| 1,475,425| $| 1,435,492  \n* *Percentage of sales. Data may not add due to rounding.  \n[1] – Pretax acquisition-related intangible asset amortization results from allocating the purchase price of acquisitions to the acquired tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business and recognizing the cost of the intangible asset over the period of benefit. Such costs were $6.2 million pretax (or $4.6 million after tax) during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and $17.1 million pretax (or $12.9 million after tax) during the nine months ended September 28, 2024.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses to complete and integrate acquisitions, accretion on contingent consideration obligations and facility consolidation and start-up expenses of $0.5 million pretax (or $0.4 million after tax) and $3.1 million pretax (or $2.4 million after tax), respectively.[3] – Pretax executive transition service expenses represents an accrual for costs required to be paid under an agreement in connection with the planned transition of our Executive Chairman to Non-Executive Chairman, and other professional services rendered in connection with the execution of the agreement. The expense was $1.8 million pretax (or $1.4 million after tax) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.[4] – Fair value adjustments to contingent consideration represents the change to our estimates of ultimate earnout payment amounts for a previously completed acquisition based on projections of financial performance compared to the target amounts defined in the purchase agreement and totaled $1.0 million pretax (or $0.8 million after tax) and $13.4 million pretax (or $10.2 million after tax) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.[5] – Pretax reduction in workforce costs represents costs incurred in connection with our planned workforce reduction including severance and other payroll-related costs insurance continuation costs, modifications of share-based compensation awards, and other costs directly attributable to the action. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the expense was $0.1 million pretax (or $0.1 million after tax) and $4.9 million pretax (or $3.7 million after tax), respectively.[6] – Tax adjustments represent the aggregate tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments reflected in the table above and totaled $(1.7) million and $(5.8) million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and $(1.2) million and $(4.9) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Such items are estimated by applying our statutory tax rate to the pretax amount, or an actual tax amount for discrete items.  \n  \n**2024 Guidance:**\n\nThe Company provides the following updated guidance ranges related to their fiscal 2024 outlook:\n\n**Year Ending 12/31/2024**  \n---  \n**(unaudited)**|  Low End*| High End*  \nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP)| $| 6.15| $| 6.25  \nPretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization| 0.73| 0.73  \nPretax acquisition transaction and other costs| 0.05| 0.05  \nPretax reduction in workforce costs| 0.15| 0.15  \nTax adjustment (related to above items)| (0.23| )| (0.23| )  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP)| $| 6.85| $| 6.95  \nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding| 31,000| 31,000  \n*Data may not add due to rounding.  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NTU4NiM2NTU3OTY5IzIwODMxMjY=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZDQzNDUyOWItODRkNS00NTNhLWEyZTctMmIwNjRlZWU4NmFjLTEwOTQ2OTc=/tiny/Dorman-Products-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/a7506025-02a1-4098-b71b-671d7606554e/small/dorman-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a7506025-02a1-4098-b71b-671d7606554e)\n\nSource: Dorman Products, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.dormanproducts.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Investor Contact\n\nFor investor inquiries, please send us an email at:\n\ninvestors@dormanproducts.com\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

(NASDAQ:DORM) is announcing the release of hundreds of new aftermarket components and assemblies, adding to its expansive catalog of more than 133,000 SKUs. Several of these new offerings represent aftermarket exclusives, first-to-aftermarket solutions that help keep vehicles on the road for everyday drivers while providing millions of repair opportunities for parts distributors, retailers and repair shops.\n\nDesigned to offer a better repair solution than the OEM, the following Dorman® OE FIX™ products were released:\n\n  * An exhaust manifold repair clamp that saves time and labor on repairs to certain General Motors and Isuzu vehicles. When an exhaust manifold fastener breaks, the clamp offers an alternative to fixing the manifold to the cylinder head without needing to extract the broken stud.\n  * A transmission gearshift bracket designed to match the fit of the original part, but manufactured from a higher grade, more durable aluminum alloy, and engineered with a much sturdier double-bolt design that more effectively and consistently distributes the stresses of changing gears. Offers a hassle-free and predictable repair when the column-mounted shift lever on certain Dodge and Ram trucks becomes sloppy or inoperable. Also includes a direct replacement shift interlock solenoid.\n  * A flexible braided stainless steel fuel line made with stainless steel over flexible PTFE tubing, specific length for select Chevrolet, Pontiac and Buick vehicles. Original-style hard fuel lines can be tough to route under the vehicle, while this OE FIX offers new brackets and factory connectors designed to offer the easiest possible installation.\n\n\n\nAdditional noteworthy innovations for October include:\n\n  * A loaded brake backing plate, a pre-assembled solution for select Ford vehicles, designed to save time and labor, as well as provide structure for the other components in the braking system while also helping to keep debris from entering.\n  * A turbocharger inlet duct and charge air cooler pipe for popular Ram trucks, adding to Dorman’s diverse array of critical turbocharger accessories. Designed to match the performance of the original lines, these cost-effective replacements help remedy leaking or failed original lines.\n  * Precision-engineered and manufactured to match the performance of the factory manifold on specified Ford Transit vans, exhaust manifold kits resist warping, cracking and leaking for long-lasting performance.\n  * A back-up sensor for select Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram vehicles, a reliable replacement for an original part that has failed due to fatigue or electrical malfunction.\n  * An engine heater hose assembly for specified Ford Super Duty trucks, precision-manufactured to match the performance of the original equipment hose which failed due to heat and fatigue.\n  * An engine valve cover manufactured from quality materials to withstand extreme temperatures to resist leaking for certain Infiniti and Nissan models.\n\n\n\nIn total, these featured product solutions offer more than 18 million new repair opportunities, giving repair professionals, enthusiasts and owners greater freedom to fix motor vehicles.\n\nFind Dorman products near you using the [Where to Buy](https://www.dormanproducts.com/pages/wheretobuy/dorman.aspx) search tool or take the Dorman Virtual Tour at [DormanProducts.com/tour](http://DormanProducts.com/tour) to learn more about the company, including history, culture and more.\n\n**Contacts**\n\n  * **Marketing:** Steve Gisondi, Vice President of Marketing, sgisondi@dormanproducts.com\n  * **Investor Relations****:** Alex Whitelam, Vice President, Investor Relations & Risk Management, awhitelam@dormanproducts.com\n\n\n\nVisit our website at [www.dormanproducts.com](http://www.dormanproducts.com).
