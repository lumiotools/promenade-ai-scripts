(NASDAQ: TER) reported revenue of $737 million for the third quarter of 2024 of which $543 million was in Semiconductor Test, $73 million in System Test, $33 million in Wireless Test and $89 million in Robotics. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $145.6 million or $0.89 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne’s net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $147.6 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and other charges, amortization on our investment in Technoprobe, legal settlement, pension mark-to-market, and included the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments. \n\n“Semiconductor Test continues to perform better than planned on record Memory revenue driven by High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and compute demand for AI applications,” said Teradyne CEO, Greg Smith. “Robotics continues to execute to its longer-term growth strategy with improving traction in recurring software and services revenue and progress in the UR OEM channel. As we finish 2024 and look forward to 2025, we are excited about building on this progress.\" \n\nGuidance for the fourth quarter of 2024 is revenue of $710 million to $760 million, with GAAP net income of $0.73 to $0.91 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $0.80 to $0.97 per diluted share.

These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income exclude acquired intangible assets amortization, restructuring and other, pension actuarial gains and losses, stock compensation modification expense, gains and losses on foreign exchange options in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, gain on sale of business, legal settlement, discrete income tax adjustments, and includes the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and net income. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP net income per share are non-GAAP performance measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne’s baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne’s current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP performance measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne’s business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne’s competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne’s call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP performance measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne’s financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne’s results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at [www.teradyne.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.teradyne.com&esheet=54140985&newsitemid=20241023481464&lan=en-US&anchor=www.teradyne.com&index=4&md5=9adff6435cea3367189bd723b7796d6c) by clicking on “Investor Relations” and then selecting “Financials” and the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation” link.

GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2024 was $186.3 million or $1.14 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne’s net income in the second quarter of 2024 was $140.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and other charges, gains on foreign exchange options in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, gain on sale of business, and included the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments. \n\n“In the second quarter, AI applications drove accelerated demand from both compute and memory customers, and our robotics business grew sequentially and year-over-year,” said Teradyne CEO Greg Smith. “Overall, 2024 is shaping up as we expected, and we believe the deployment of edge AI will strengthen demand in our test and robotics businesses over the mid-term.” \n\nGuidance for the third quarter of 2024 is revenue of $680 million to $740 million, with GAAP net income of $0.62 to $0.82 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $0.66 to $0.86 per diluted share. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset amortization and amortization on our investment in Technoprobe, as well as the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments. \n\n**Webcast**\n\nA conference call to discuss the second quarter results, along with management’s business outlook, will follow at 8:30 a.m. ET, Thursday, July 25, 2024.

A replay will be available on the Teradyne website at [www.teradyne.com/investors](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.teradyne.com%2Finvestors&esheet=54098703&newsitemid=20240723866897&lan=en-US&anchor=www.teradyne.com%2Finvestors&index=3&md5=d359fa82387edaf38574562a735e0324). \n\n**Non-GAAP Results**\n\nIn addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income exclude acquired intangible assets amortization, restructuring and other, pension actuarial gains and losses, stock compensation modification expense, gains and losses on foreign exchange options in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, gain on sale of business, discrete income tax adjustments, and includes the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and net income. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP net income per share are non-GAAP performance measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne’s baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne’s current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP performance measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne’s business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne’s competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne’s call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP performance measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne’s financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne’s results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at [www.teradyne.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.teradyne.com&esheet=54098703&newsitemid=20240723866897&lan=en-US&anchor=www.teradyne.com&index=4&md5=85c43d9d10033d00e766df338ce8f90c) by clicking on “Investor Relations” and then selecting “Financials” and the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation” link. The non-GAAP performance measures discussed in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**About Teradyne**\n\nTeradyne (NASDAQ:TER) test technology helps bring high-quality innovations such as smart devices, life-saving medical equipment and data storage systems to market, faster.
