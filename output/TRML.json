(Tourmaline) (NASDAQ: TRML), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company developing transformative medicines to dramatically improve the lives of patients with life-altering immune and inflammatory diseases, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and outlined recent business highlights.\n\n“We are proud of the continued momentum building at Tourmaline, highlighted by the formation of our Cardiovascular Scientific Advisory Board last month,” said Sandeep Kulkarni, MD, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tourmaline. “Beyond the internal progress we have been making, we recognize the growing external enthusiasm around the potential for IL-6 inhibition in cardiovascular disease, including numerous publications outlining the importance of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as an important biomarker for inflammatory risk. We look forward to continued execution throughout the remainder of 2024 as we approach key data readouts in 2025.”\n\n**Clinical Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n**_Cardiovascular Inflammation_**\n\n  * At the American Society of Preventive Cardiology Annual Congress held in August 2024, Tourmaline presented a poster describing the rationale and design of the Phase 2 TRANQUILITY trial (_Evaluating TOUR006 in Participants with Chronic Kidney Disease and Elevated hs-CRP: Rationale and Design of the TRANQUILITY Phase 2 Study_).\n  * At the 19th Annual Cardiometabolic Health Congress held in October 2024, Tourmaline presented two posters (_Utilization of High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Testing in Primary and Secondary ASCVD Preventio_ n and _Effect of IL-6 Inhibition on Lipoprotein(a) Levels: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis_).\n  * In October 2024, Tourmaline announced the formation of its CV SAB, comprised of academic and industry veterans with significant experience in cardiovascular medicine, clinical trial design and execution, and therapeutic innovation. Insights and guidance from the CV SAB are expected to be instrumental in shaping the strategic direction of Tourmaline’s cardiovascular program as the company prepares for Phase 3 clinical trial readiness in 2025, supporting efforts to redefine standards of care for high-risk cardiovascular disease patients.\n  * The Phase 2 TRANQUILITY trial, which evaluates quarterly and monthly subcutaneous dosing of pacibekitug in patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and chronic kidney disease, is ongoing. Tourmaline continues to expect topline data from this trial in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_TED_**\n\n  * The pivotal spiriTED Phase 2b trial in TED is ongoing, and Tourmaline expects topline data from this trial in the second half of 2025.\n  * Tourmaline is on track to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating pacibekitug delivered subcutaneously every 8 weeks as first-line treatment for TED in the second half of 2024, with topline data expected in 2026.\n\n\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Results:**\n\n**_Cash Position_**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $314.4 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $203.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Tourmaline anticipates that its current cash, cash equivalents and investments will provide cash runway into 2027, funding its operations through key pacibekitug data readouts in TED and cardiovascular disease and providing the opportunity to expand development efforts into additional indications.\n\n\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\n  * Research and development expenses were $19.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by employee compensation costs attributable to increased headcount, increased drug manufacturing expenses, and increased costs related to the spiriTED and TRANQUILITY clinical trials.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $5.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by employee compensation costs attributable to increased headcount, increased insurance expenses associated with being a public company, and increased professional service fees.\n\n\n\n**_Net Loss_**\n\n  * Net loss was $20.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, resulting in basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.78 and $5.16, respectively.\n  * The increase in net loss was attributable to increased operating expenses and Tourmaline’s overall growth throughout 2023 and into 2024. The decrease in net loss per share was attributable to the issuance of additional shares of common stock in conjunction with Tourmaline’s reverse merger and private placement completed in October 2023 and the underwritten follow-on public offering completed by Tourmaline in January 2024.\n\n\n\n**About Tourmaline Bio:**\n\nTourmaline is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company driven by its mission to develop transformative medicines that dramatically improve the lives of patients with life-altering immune and inflammatory diseases.
