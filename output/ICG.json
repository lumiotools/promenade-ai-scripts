We utilize a fabless business model and specialize in the front-end and back-end of IC design, which are the major components of the IC product development chain. We have established strong supply chain management with a leading foundry, which helps to ensure our product quality and stable production output. As of December 31, 2023, we had completed a total of nine tape-outs using our “Xihe” Platform for 22nm and 12nm ASIC chips, achieving a 100% success rate for all our tape-outs.\n\n###### HISTORY\n\n### Keep Improving\n\nWe conduct our operations in China through our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of the PRC (Our Cayman Islands holding company does not conduct operations).

Intchains Group Limited was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as our offshore holding company in June 2021 and became the ultimate holding company of our operating subsidiaries in December 2021.\n\n![](https://intchains.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/新科园大楼-scaled.jpg)\n\n![](https://intchains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/helena-lopes-PGnqT0rXWLs-unsplash-scaled-e1655633225297.jpg)\n\n###### Our Competitive Strengths\n\n### Do Our Best\n\n  * Leading fabless provider of high-performance ASIC chips for some key blockchain algorithms\n  * Innovative technology platform enabling fast time-to-market product launch and higher gross profit margin\n  * Broad product portfolio tailored to capture market growth potential\n  * Leading provider of high-performance ASIC chips for blockchain algorithms used by individual end users\n  * Close and stable relationships with our major suppliers\n\n\n\n### Discover more from Intchains Group\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email… \n\nSubscribe \n\nManage consent\n\nScroll to Top\n"
