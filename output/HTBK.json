For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $29.9 million, or $0.49 per average diluted common share, compared to $51.1 million, or $0.83 per average diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. All data are unaudited.\n\n“The highlight of the third quarter of 2024 was significant deposit growth from our clients throughout our markets,” said Clay Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Total deposit balances grew 6% at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter and notably, noninterest-bearing demand deposits grew 7% over the same period. Growth in deposits was a result of the successful conversion of new relationships that were impacted by the banking disruptions in our market. The loan portfolio had orderly growth during the third quarter 2024, with core loans increasing $148.3 million, or 5% over the last 12 months, while growing $35.7 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter. We remain optimistic about the growth opportunities in our markets, as loan and deposit pipelines and overall business activity remains healthy.”\n\n“The credit portfolio continues to perform very well, with nonperforming assets and net charge-offs remaining low at September 30, 2024,” said Mr. Jones. “Additionally, our liquidity position remains strong, supported by access to diverse alternative funding sources.”\n\n“Our commitment to achieving our growth and client service goals while meeting performance targets remains the driving force behind our success. I would like to express my appreciation for our bank team members for their continued commitment to serving our clients, communities and shareholders,” said Mr. Jones.\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024****Operating Results, Liquidity Position, Financial Condition, Credit Quality, Capital Management and Recent Events**\n\n(as of, or for the periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, except as noted):\n\n**Operating Results:**\n\n  * The following table indicates the ratios for the annualized return on average equity, average tangible common equity, average assets and average tangible assets for the periods indicated:\n\n\n\n**For the Quarter Ended:**| **For the Nine Months Ended:**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,**| **June 30,**| **September 30,**| **September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**(unaudited)**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nReturn on average equity| 6.14| %| 5.50| %| 9.54| %| 5.91| %| 10.54| %  \nReturn on average tangible common equity(1)| 8.27| %| 7.43| %| 13.06| %| 7.98| %| 14.52| %  \nReturn on average assets| 0.78| %| 0.71| %| 1.16| %| 0.76| %| 1.29| %  \nReturn on average tangible assets(1)| 0.81| %| 0.74| %| 1.20| %| 0.79| %| 1.33| %  \n  \n(1)| This is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and discussed under _“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”_ below.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Net Interest Income:_\n\n  * Net interest income increased 1% to $39.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $39.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The non-GAAP fully tax equivalent (“FTE”) net interest margin contracted 9 basis points to 3.17% for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.26% for the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher rates paid on client deposits, partially offset by maturing securities invested in higher yielding overnight funds, one additional day during the third quarter of 2024, and a higher average yield on core loans. \n  * Net interest income decreased (12%) to $39.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $45.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The non-GAAP FTE net interest margin contracted 40 basis points to 3.17% for the third quarter of 2024, from 3.57% for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher rates paid on client deposits, a decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, and a decrease in average interest earning assets, partially offset by a higher average yield on core loans and a higher average balance of loans.\n  * For the first nine months of 2024, net interest income decreased (15%) to $119.5 million, compared to $140.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. The non-GAAP FTE net interest margin contracted 54 basis points to 3.26% for the first nine months of 2024, from 3.80% for the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher rates paid on client deposits, a decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, and a decrease in average interest earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the yield on core loans and overnight funds and a higher average balance of loans. \n  * The following tables set forth the estimated changes in the Company’s annual net interest income and economic value of equity (a non-GAAP financial measure) that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates noted, and assuming a flat balance sheet with consistent product mix, as of September 30, 2024:\n\n\n\n**Increase/(Decrease) in**  \n---  \n**Estimated Net**  \n**CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES (basis points)**| **Interest Income****(1)**  \n**(in $000's, unaudited)**| **Amount**| **Percent**  \n+400| $| 24,681| 13.6| %  \n+300| $| 18,438| 10.2| %  \n+200| $| 12,241| 6.8| %  \n+100| $| 6,082| 3.4| %  \n0| —| —  \n−100| $| (8,242| )| (4.5| )| %  \n−200| $| (18,720| )| (10.3| )| %  \n−300| $| (31,428| )| (17.3| )| %  \n−400| $| (47,015| )| (25.9| )| %  \n  \n**Increase/(Decrease) in**  \n---  \n**Estimated Economic**  \n**CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES (basis points)**| **Value of Equity****(1)**  \n**(in $000's, unaudited)**| **Amount**| **Percent**  \n+400| $| 161,338| 14.0| %  \n+300| $| 133,760| 11.6| %  \n+200| $| 98,755| 8.6| %  \n+100| $| 55,024| 4.8| %  \n0| —| —  \n−100| $| (86,037| )| (7.5| )| %  \n−200| $| (204,813| )| (17.8| )| %  \n−300| $| (345,418| )| (30.1| )| %  \n−400| $| (452,503| )| (39.4| )| %  \n  \n(1)| Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are for illustrative purposes only, are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.

Total noninterest income was relatively flat at $2.2 million for both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Total noninterest income decreased (7%) to $6.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $7.1 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower service charges and fees on deposit accounts, partially offset by a higher gain on proceeds from company-owned life insurance for the first nine months of 2024.\n\n\n\n_Noninterest Expense:_\n\n  * Total noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $27.6 million, compared to $28.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefits and lower information technology related expenses, partially offset by higher professional fees. Total noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $27.6 million, compared to $25.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits, rent expense included in occupancy and equipment, and professional fees.\n  * Total noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased to $83.3 million, compared to $75.6 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits, rent expense, and information technology related expenses, marketing related expenses, homeowner association vendor payments, regulatory assessments, and ICS/CDARS fee expense. \n  * Full time equivalent employees were 353 at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, compared to 348 at September 30, 2023. \n  * The efficiency ratio was 65.37% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 67.55% for the second quarter of 2024, and 52.89% for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio increased to 66.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 51.06% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the respective periods in 2023, was due to both higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue. The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\n\n\n_Income Tax Expense:_\n\n  * Income tax expense was $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, and $6.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 27.3%, compared to 29.4% for the second quarter of 2024, and 29.0% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $12.0 million, compared to $20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.7%, compared to 29.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Liquidity Position, Financial Condition, Credit Quality, and Capital Management:**\n\n_Liquidity and Available Lines of Credit:_\n\n  * The following table shows our liquidity, available lines of credit and the amounts outstanding at September 30, 2024:\n\n\n\n**LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT**| **Total**| **Remaining**  \n---|---|---  \n**(in $000’s, unaudited)**| **Available**| **Outstanding**| **Available**  \nExcess funds at the Federal Reserve Bank (\"FRB\")| $| 903,900| $| —| $| 903,900  \nFRB discount window collateralized line of credit| 1,397,326| —| 1,397,326  \nFederal Home Loan Bank collateralized borrowing capacity| 765,134| —| 765,134  \nUnpledged investment securities (at fair value)| 66,158| —| 66,158  \nFederal funds purchase arrangements| 90,000| —| 90,000  \nHolding company line of credit| 25,000| —| 25,000  \nTotal| $| 3,247,518| $| —| $| 3,247,518  \n  \n•| The Company’s total available liquidity and borrowing capacity was $3.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 billion at June 30, 2024, and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n•| The available liquidity and borrowing capacity was 69% of the Company’s total deposits and approximately 147% of the Bank’s estimated uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024.

The contents of our website are not incorporated into, and do not form a part of, this release or of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nFinancial results are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company’s performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are common in the banking industry, and may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should be supplemental to primary GAAP financial measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for primary GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is presented in the tables at the end of this earnings release under _“Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”_\n\n**Forward-Looking Statement Disclaimer**\n\nCertain matters discussed in this press release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to the Company’s future financial performance, projected cash flows of our investment securities portfolio, the performance of our loan portfolio, estimated net interest income resulting from a shift in interest rates, expectation of high credit quality issuers ability to repay, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations from expected developments or events. Any statements that reflect our belief about, confidence in, or expectations for future events, performance or condition should be considered forward-looking statements. Readers should not construe these statements as assurances of a given level of performance, nor as promises that we will take actions that we currently expect to take. All statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control and some of which may fall outside our ability to predict or anticipate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from our projected results, and we may take actions or experience events that we do not currently expect. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial performance to differ materially from our goals, plans, expectations and projections expressed in forward-looking statements include those set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Item 1A of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and the following: (1) cybersecurity risks that may affect us directly or may impact us indirectly by virtue of their effects on our clients, markets or vendors, including our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks, including

vendors and service providers; (2) geopolitical and domestic political developments, including recent, current and potential future wars and international and multinational conflicts, acts of terrorism, insurrection, piracy and civil unrest, and events reflecting or resulting from social instability, any of which can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability, contribute to rising energy and commodity prices, can affect the physical security of our assets and the assets of our clients, and which may increase the volatility of financial markets; (3) factors that affect our liquidity and our ability to meet client demands for withdrawals from deposit accounts and undrawn lines of credit, including our cash on hand and the availability of funds from our own lines of credit; (4) market fluctuations that affect the costs we pay for sources of funding, including the interest we pay on deposits and on our borrowings; (5) media items and consumer confidence as those factors affect our clients’ confidence in the banking system generally and in our bank specifically; (6) factors that affect the value and liquidity of our investment portfolios, particularly the values of securities available-for-sale; (7) effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and other factors that affect market interest rates generally; (8) our ability to estimate accurately, and to establish adequate reserves against, the risk of loss associated with our loan and lease portfolio and our factoring business; (9) events and circumstances that affect our borrowers' and guarantors’ financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which may, during periods of economic uncertainty or decline, adversely affect those borrowers' ability to repay our loans timely and in full, or to comply with their other obligations under our loan agreements with those clients; (10) current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the communities we serve, including the effects of declines in property values and overall fluctuations in economic growth; (11) inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans to clients, whether held in the portfolio or in the secondary market; (12) changes in the level of nonperforming assets and charge offs and other credit quality measures, and their impact on the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and our provision for credit losses; (13) conditions relating to the impact of recent and potential future pandemics, epidemics and other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future, on our clients, employees, businesses, liquidity, financial results and overall condition including severity and duration of the associated uncertainties in U.S. and global markets; (14) the relative strength or weakness of the commercial and real estate markets where our borrowers are located, including related vacancy rates, and asset and market prices; (15) increased capital requirements for our continual growth or as imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; (16) regulatory limits and practical factors that affect Heritage Bank of Commerce’s ability to pay dividends to the Company; (17) operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which we are highly dependent; (18) events that affect our ability to attract, recruit, and retain qualified officers and other personnel to implement our strategic plan, and that enable current and future personnel to protect and develop our relationships with clients, and to promote our business, results of operations and growth prospects; (19) factors that affect the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions; (20) effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting standard setters; (21) the expense and uncertain resolution of litigation matters whether occurring in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, particularly including but not limited to the effects of recent and ongoing developments in California labor and employment laws, regulations and court decisions; (22) geographic and sociopolitical factors that arise by virtue of the fact that we operate primarily in the general San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California, including the particular risks of natural disasters (including earthquakes, fires, and flooding) and other events that disproportionately affect that region; (23) actions taken, planned, or announced by federal, state, regional and local governments in response to the occurrence or threat of any of the foregoing; and (24) our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing factors.\n\nMember
