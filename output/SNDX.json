The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations as well as Priority Review for Revuforj. The New Drug Application (NDA) received approval through the FDA's Real Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program.\n\n\"The approval of Revuforj is a remarkable achievement that reflects the dedication and tenacity of everyone involved, especially the patients and clinicians who participated in our trial and our talented Syndax team,\" said Michael A. Metzger, Chief Executive Officer of Syndax. \"We are well-prepared to launch Revuforj this month and we are committed to rapidly advancing the development of Revuforj across the treatment continuum for KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemias and mutant NPM1 AML.\"\n\nThe efficacy evaluation of Revuforj was based on an FDA analysis of 104 patients with R/R acute leukemia with a KMT2A translocation who were treated with Revuforj in the Phase 1/2 AUGMENT-101 trial. In the efficacy population, the rate of complete remission (CR) plus CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh) was 21% (22/104 pts; 95% CI: 13.8%, 30.3%). The median duration of CR+CRh was 6.4 months (95% CI: 2.7, not estimable) and the median time to CR or CRh was 1.9 months (range: 0.9, 5.6 months). Twenty-three percent (24/104 pts) of patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following treatment with Revuforj. Results from the 104-patient efficacy analysis are consistent with the previously reported, protocol-defined Phase 2 interim analysis of patients with R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia in the AUGMENT-101 trial (n=57) which were published in the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ 1. \n\n\"The FDA approval of the first menin inhibitor is a major breakthrough for patients with R/R acute leukemia with a KMT2A translocation, a genetic alteration associated with a very poor prognosis,\" said Ghayas C. Issa, M.D., Associate Professor of Leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \"The significant clinical benefit and robust efficacy seen with Revuforj represents a substantial improvement over what has been historically observed in these patients with previously available therapies and has the potential to be an important new treatment option for patients.\"\n\nThe safety evaluation of Revuforj was based on an FDA analysis of 135 patients with R/R acute leukemia with a KMT2A translocation who were treated with Revuforj. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) including laboratory abnormalities were hemorrhage, nausea, phosphate increased, musculoskeletal pain, infection, aspartate aminotransferase increased, febrile neutropenia, alanine aminotransferase increased, parathyroid hormone intact increased, bacterial infection, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, phosphate decreased, triglycerides increased, potassium decreased, decreased appetite, constipation, edema, viral infection, fatigue, and alkaline phosphatase increased. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction or permanent discontinuation were low at 10% and 12% of patients, respectively.\n\nRearrangements of the KMT2A gene (KMT2Ar) give rise to an aggressive form of acute leukemia that is associated with a very poor prognosis and high relapse rates.2 It is estimated that more than 95% of patients with KMT2Ar acute leukemia have a KMT2A translocation, a type of rearrangement that occurs when part of one chromosome breaks and fuses to a different chromosome.3 More than half of patients with KMT2Ar acute leukemia will relapse after receiving conventional frontline therapies, with a median overall survival (OS) of less than one year.4 With third line treatment or beyond, only 5% of patients achieve complete remission, and the median OS is less than three months.4\n\nSyndax expects that the 110 and 160 mg tablets of Revuforj will be available for order in the United States through a network of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies in November. Syndax expects that the 25 mg tablets, which may be used to treat patients who weigh less than 40 kg, will be commercially available in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025. Prior to commercial availability of the 25 mg tablets, an oral solution of revumenib will be available through an expanded access program to allow for dosing of patients who weigh less than 40 kg. \n\nSyndax is committed to supporting patients and removing barriers to access. As part of that commitment, Syndax has established SyndAccess™, a robust program that offers personalized support and resources to U.S. patients who are prescribed Revuforj, including financial assistance for eligible patients.

Positive pivotal data from the AUGMENT-101 trial in this population with revumenib as a monotherapy were recently [reported](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304779-1&h=2749022056&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.syndax.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fsyndax-announces-positive-pivotal-topline-results-relapsed-or&a=reported). Additionally, multiple trials of revumenib in combination with standard-of-care agents in mNPM1 AML or KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemia are ongoing across the treatment landscape, including in newly diagnosed patients.\n\nRevumenib was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of AML, ALL and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) by the U.S. FDA and for the treatment of AML by the European Commission. The U.S. FDA also granted Fast Track designation to revumenib for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemias harboring a KMT2A rearrangement or NPM1 mutation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemia harboring a KMT2A rearrangement.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME**\n\n**Differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal, has occurred with Revuforj. Signs and symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, and renal dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, immediately initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution.**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Differentiation syndrome:** Revuforj can cause fatal or life-threatening differentiation syndrome (DS). Symptoms of DS, including those seen in patients treated with Revuforj, include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, peripheral edema, pleuropericardial effusion, acute renal failure, and/or hypotension. In clinical trials, DS occurred in 39 (29%) of 135 patients treated with Revuforj. DS was Grade 3 or 4 in 13% of patients and fatal in one. The median time to onset was 10 days (range 3-41 days). Some patients experienced more than 1 DS event. Treatment interruption was required for 7% of patients, and treatment was withdrawn for 1%.\n\nReduce the white blood cell count to less than 25 Gi/L prior to starting Revuforj. If DS is suspected, immediately initiate treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10-mg IV every 12 hours in adults or dexamethasone 0.25-mg/kg/dose IV every 12 hours in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg) for a minimum of 3 days and until resolution of signs and symptoms. Institute supportive measures and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. Interrupt Revuforj if severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of systemic corticosteroids, or earlier if life-threatening symptoms occur such as pulmonary symptoms requiring ventilator support. Restart steroids promptly if DS recurs after tapering corticosteroids.\n\n**QTc interval prolongation** : In the clinical trials, QTc interval prolongation was reported as an adverse reaction in 39 (29%) of 135 patients treated with Revuforj. QTc interval prolongation was Grade 3 in 12% of patients. The heart-rate corrected QT interval (using Fridericia's method) (QTcF) was greater than 500 msec in 8%, and the increase from baseline QTcF was greater than 60 msec in 18%. Revuforj dose reduction was required for 5% of patients due to QTc interval prolongation. QTc prolongation occurred in 16% of the 31 patients less than 17 years old, 33% of the 88 patients 17 years to less than 65 years old, and in 50% of the 16 patients 65 years or older.\n\nCorrect electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, prior to treatment with Revuforj. Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiation of Revuforj, and do not initiate Revuforj in patients with QTcF >450 msec. Perform an ECG at least once weekly for the first 4 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. In patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval, more frequent ECG monitoring may be necessary. Concomitant use with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation.\n\n  * Interrupt Revuforj if QTcF increases >480 msec and <500 msec, and restart Revuforj at the same dose twice daily after the QTcF interval returns to ≤480 msec\n  * Interrupt Revuforj if QTcF increases >500 msec or by >60 msec from baseline, and restart Revuforj twice daily at the lower-dose level after the QTcF interval returns to ≤480 msec\n  * Permanently discontinue Revuforj in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and in those who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia.\n\n\n\n**Embryo-fetal toxicity:** Revuforj can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Revuforj and for 4 months after the last dose of Revuforj.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nFatal adverse reactions occurred in 4 (3%) patients who received Revuforj, including 2 with differentiation syndrome, 1 with hemorrhage, and 1 with sudden death.\n\nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 99 (73%) patients. The most frequent **serious adverse reactions** (≥5%) were infection (24%), febrile neutropenia (19%), bacterial infection (17%), differentiation syndrome (12%), hemorrhage (9%), and thrombosis (5%).\n\nThe most **common adverse reactions** (≥20%) including laboratory abnormalities, were hemorrhage (53%), nausea (51%), phosphate increased (50%), musculoskeletal pain (42%), infection (41%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (37%), febrile neutropenia (35%), alanine aminotransferase increased (33%), parathyroid hormone intact increased (33%), bacterial infection (31%), diarrhea (30%), differentiation syndrome (29%), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (29%), phosphate decreased (25%), triglycerides increased (25%), potassium decreased (24%), decreased appetite (24%), constipation (23%), edema (23%), viral infection (23%), fatigue (22%), and alkaline phosphatase increased (21%).\n\n**DRUG INTERACTIONS** Drug interactions can occur when Revuforj is concomitantly used with:\n\n  * Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: reduce Revuforj dose\n  * Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers: avoid concomitant use with Revuforj\n  * QTc-prolonging drugs: avoid concomitant use with Revuforj. If concomitant use is unavoidable, obtain ECGs when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated. Withhold Revuforj if the QTc interval is >480 msec. Restart Revuforj after the QTc interval returns to ≤480 msec.\n\n\n\n**SPECIFIC POPULATIONS****Lactation:** advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Revuforj and for 1 week after the last dose. \n\n**Pregnancy and testing:** Revuforj can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating Revuforj.\n\n**Pediatric:** monitor bone growth and development in pediatric patients.\n\n**Geriatric:** compared to younger patients, the incidences of QTc prolongation and edema were higher in patients 65 years and older.\n\n**Infertility:** based on findings in animals, Revuforj may impair fertility. The effects on fertility were reversible.\n\n**To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Syndax Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-539-3REV or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or ****[www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304779-1&h=540397879&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch&a=www.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch)****.**\n\n**Please see****[Full Prescribing Information](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304779-1&h=2420730594&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.syndax.com%2Frevuforj-full-prescribing-info%2F&a=Full+Prescribing+Information)****, including BOXED WARNING.**\n\n**About KMT2A-Rearranged Acute Leukemia**\n\nRearrangements of the KMT2A gene (KMT2Ar) give rise to an aggressive form of acute leukemia that is associated with a very poor prognosis and high relapse rates.2 It is estimated that more than 95% of patients with KMT2Ar acute leukemia have a KMT2A translocation, a type of rearrangement that occurs when part of one chromosome breaks and fuses to a different chromosome.3\n\nIn KMT2Ar acute leukemias, binding of KMT2A fusion proteins with the protein called menin drives the activation of a leukemogenic transcriptional pathway. Inhibition of the menin-KMT2A interaction has been shown to alter the transcription of multiple genes including differentiation markers. KMT2Ar AML and ALL have a rapid onset and quick progression that makes early identification of a KMT2A rearrangement critical.4,5 It is routinely diagnosed through currently available cytogenetic or molecular diagnostic techniques. \n\n**About Syndax**\n\nSyndax Pharmaceuticals is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies.

Among the patients who achieved CR/CRh, 12 patients had a CR and three had a CRh. The observed median duration of CR/CRh responses was 4.7 months (95% CI: 1.2, 8.2) at the time of the data cutoff with three patients remaining in response. Minimal residual disease (MRD) status was assessed in 14 of 15 patients who achieved CR/CRh, 64% (9/14) of whom were MRD negative. The overall response rate (ORR)1 was 47% (30/64; 95% CI: 34%, 60%). 17% (5/30) of patients who achieved an overall response underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) following treatment with revumenib, with three resuming revumenib therapy post-transplant.\n\n\"We are thrilled to report positive pivotal data in R/R mNPM1 AML patients treated with revumenib, which has shown compelling and notably consistent results across treatment settings for both mNPM1 AML and KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemias,\" said Michael A. Metzger, Chief Executive Officer of Syndax. \"With the anticipated FDA approval of revumenib for the treatment of R/R KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemias this quarter, and this second positive pivotal data readout, we are well-positioned to meaningfully impact the estimated 40% of AML patients with these two genetic alterations.\" \n\nThe AUGMENT-101 Phase 2 protocol-defined efficacy evaluable population included 64 adult patients with R/R mNPM1 AML. The median age was 65 (range: 19, 84). Patients were heavily pretreated, with 36% having received three or more prior lines of therapy (median prior lines: 2) and 75% of patients previously treated with venetoclax. \n\nThe safety population included 84 adult and pediatric patients with R/R mNPM1 AML in the Phase 2 portion of the AUGMENT-101 trial. The safety profile observed with revumenib in this population was consistent with previously reported data. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) leading to treatment discontinuations were 5% (4/84). TRAEs of Grade ≥3 in more than 10% of patients included: QTc prolongation (21%), anemia (14%), febrile neutropenia (13%), differentiation syndrome (13%), and platelet count decreased (11%). Grade 3 treatment-related DS was observed in 11% (9/84) of patients while 2% (2/84) experienced Grade 4 DS and no patients experienced Grade 5. Grade 3 treatment-related QTc prolongation was observed in 19% (16/84) of patients while 2% (2/84) experienced Grade 4 QTc prolongation and no patients experienced Grade 5.\n\n\"Relapsed or refractory mNPM1 AML is a very challenging disease with a poor prognosis and an urgent need for new treatments,\" said Eytan M. Stein, M.D., Chief, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \"The positive results for revumenib in this heavily pre-treated population, which included more than 75% who previously failed venetoclax, are very encouraging. In particular, the robust rates of overall response, including deep molecular remissions and low discontinuation rates, highlight the tremendous promise of revumenib in the treatment of R/R mNPM1 AML patients.\"\n\n**Revumenib Near-Term Milestones**\n\nThe Company has several trials of revumenib ongoing across the treatment landscape in mNPM1 and KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2Ar) acute leukemias. In addition to the clinical trials that Syndax is conducting, the Company is working with cooperative groups and key investigators to further elucidate the potential clinical benefit of revumenib. Syndax expects to achieve the following upcoming revumenib milestones:\n\n  * Receive FDA approval for treatment of R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemias in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * Present data in KMT2Ar and mNPM1 acute leukemias at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2024.\n  * Initiate a pivotal combination trial with venetoclax/azacitidine in newly diagnosed mNPM1 AML or KMT2Ar acute leukemias by year-end 2024.\n  * Publish pivotal AUGMENT-101 results in R/R mNPM1 AML patients and present results at a medical conference in the first half of 2025.\n  * Submit a supplemental NDA (sNDA) for treatment of R/R mNPM1 AML in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** Syndax will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results of the AUGMENT-101 trial in R/R mNPM1 AML today, November 12, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET.\n\nThe live webcast may be accessed through the [Events & Presentations](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4300179-1&h=624665942&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.syndax.com%2Fevents-presentations&a=Events+%26+Presentations) page in the Investors section of the Company's website.

The  _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ published results from the Phase 2 AUGMENT-101 trial of revumenib in R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia showing the trial met its primary endpoint.\n\nRevumenib was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of AML, ALL and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) by the U.S. FDA and for the treatment of AML by the European Commission. The U.S. FDA also granted Fast Track designation to revumenib for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemias harboring a KMT2A rearrangement or NPM1 mutation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemia harboring a KMT2A rearrangement.\n\n**About the Phase 1/2 AUGMENT-101 Trial** AUGMENT-101 an open-label, multi-center trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of revumenib that consists of a dose escalation part and an expansion part. In the dose escalation part, a revumenib dose with and without a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor was identified. The expansion part was designed to evaluate revumenib in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) KMT2Ar AML, patients with KMT2Ar ALL, and patients with mutant NPM1 (mNPM1) AML. The primary endpoint for each of the cohorts is efficacy as measured by the rate of complete remission (CR) plus CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) and short- and long-term safety and tolerability, with secondary endpoints including duration of response (DOR) and overall survival (OS).\n\nMore information can be found on [www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4300179-1&h=3940329384&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&a=www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT04065399).\n\nPositive data from the KMT2Ar AML and ALL patients in the trial supported a New Drug Application (NDA) filing for revumenib in R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia, which is currently under review by the U.S. FDA with a PDUFA action date of December 26, 2024. Positive data from the mNPM1 AML patients in the trial are expected to support an sNDA filing in the first half of 2025. \n\n**About Mutant NPM1 (mNPM1) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** Mutations in the NPM1 gene are the most common genetic alteration in adult AML and are observed in approximately 30% of cases. Patients with relapsed or refractory mNPM1 AML have a poor prognosis and high unmet need. Similar to KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemia, mNPM1 AML is highly dependent on the expression of specific developmental genes shown to be negatively impacted by inhibitors of the menin-KMT2A interaction. mNPM1 AML is routinely diagnosed through currently available screening techniques. There are currently no approved targeted therapies for mNPM1 AML.\n\n**About Syndax** Syndax Pharmaceuticals is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Highlights of the Company's pipeline include revumenib, a selective menin inhibitor, and Niktimvo™ (axatilimab-csfr), an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that blocks the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor. Fueled by our commitment to reimagining cancer care, Syndax is working to unlock the full potential of its pipeline and is conducting several clinical trials across the continuum of treatment.

Under the agreement, Syndax received $350 million in exchange for a 13.8% royalty on U.S. net sales of Niktimvo. Royalty payments to Royalty Pharma will cease upon reaching a multiple of 2.35x. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Syndax had cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments of $399.6 million and 85.6 million common shares and prefunded warrants outstanding.\n\nThird quarter 2024 research and development expenses increased to $71.0 million from $39.1 million for the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to greater clinical development expenses, higher pre-commercial manufacturing costs, and increased employee-related expenses and professional fees.\n\nThird quarter 2024 selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $31.1 million from $17.3 million for the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven by a greater level of commercial readiness activities for revumenib and axatilimab as well as higher employee-related expenses and professional fees.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, Syndax reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $84.1 million, or $0.98 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $51.1 million, or $0.73 per share, for the comparable prior year period.\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nFor the full year of 2024, the Company expects research and development expenses to be $245 to $250 million (prior guidance $240 million to $260 million) and total operating expenses to be $365 to $370 million (prior guidance $355 million to $375 million), which includes milestone payments that the Company expects to become due as well as an estimated $41 million (prior guidance $43 million) in non-cash stock compensation expense.\n\nSyndax expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the $350 million from the sale of a portion of the Niktimvo royalty and anticipated product revenue and interest income, enables the company to reach profitability. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nIn connection with the earnings release, Syndax's management team will host a conference call and live audio webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET today, Tuesday, November 5, 2024.\n\nThe live audio webcast and accompanying slides may be accessed through the Events & Presentations page in the Investors section of the Company's website. Alternatively, the conference call may be accessed through the following:\n\nConference ID: Syndax3Q24Domestic Dial-in Number: 800-590-8290International Dial-in Number: 240-690-8800Live webcast: [https://www.veracast.com/webcasts/syndax/events/SNDX3Q24.cfm](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4295428-1&h=2380899514&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.veracast.com%2Fwebcasts%2Fsyndax%2Fevents%2FSNDX3Q24.cfm&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.veracast.com%2Fwebcasts%2Fsyndax%2Fevents%2FSNDX3Q24.cfm)\n\nFor those unable to participate in the conference call or webcast, a replay will be available on the Investors section of the Company's website at [www.syndax.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4295428-1&h=4156750173&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.syndax.com%2F&a=www.syndax.com) approximately 24 hours after the conference call and will be available for 90 days following the call.\n\n**About Revumenib**\n\nRevumenib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the menin-KMT2A binding interaction that is being developed for the treatment of KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2Ar), also known as mixed lineage leukemia rearranged or MLLr, acute leukemias including acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and mNPM1 AML. The  _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ published results from the Phase 2 AUGMENT-101 trial of revumenib in R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia showing the trial met its primary endpoint.\n\nRevumenib was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of AML, ALL and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) by the U.S. FDA and for the treatment of AML by the European Commission. The U.S. FDA also granted Fast Track designation to revumenib for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemias harboring a KMT2A rearrangement or NPM1 mutation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemia harboring a KMT2A rearrangement.\n\n**About Niktimvo™ (axatilimab-csfr)**\n\nNiktimvo (axatilimab-csfr) is a first-in-class anti-CSF-1R antibody approved for use in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg (88.2 lbs).\n\nIn the U.S., Niktimvo will be co-commercialized by Syndax and Incyte. Incyte has exclusive commercialization rights for Niktimvo outside of the U.S.\n\nIn 2016, Syndax licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize axatilimab from UCB. In September 2021, Syndax and Incyte entered into an exclusive worldwide co-development and co-commercialization license agreement for axatilimab in chronic GVHD and any future indications.\n\nAxatilimab is being studied in frontline combination trials in chronic GVHD – a Phase 2 combination trial with ruxolitinib (NCT06388564) is underway and a Phase 3 combination trial with steroids is in preparation. Axatilimab is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 trial in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (NCT06132256).\n\n**About the Real-Time Oncology Review Program (RTOR)**\n\nRTOR provides a more efficient review process for oncology drugs to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while improving review quality and engaging in early iterative communication with the applicant. Specifically, it allows for close engagement between the sponsor and the FDA throughout the submission process and it enables the FDA to review individual sections of modules of a drug application rather than requiring the submission of complete modules or a complete application prior to initiating review. Additional information about RTOR can be found at: [https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/real-time-oncology-review-pilot-program](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4295428-1&h=3850171582&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fabout-fda%2Foncology-center-excellence%2Freal-time-oncology-review-pilot-program&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fabout-fda%2Foncology-center-excellence%2Freal-time-oncology-review-pilot-program)\n\n**About Syndax**\n\nSyndax Pharmaceuticals is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Highlights of the Company's pipeline include revumenib, a selective menin inhibitor, and Niktimvo™ (axatilimab-csfr), an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that blocks the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor.
