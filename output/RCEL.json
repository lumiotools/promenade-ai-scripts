(NASDAQ: RCEL, ASX: AVH), a commercial-stage regenerative medicine company focused on first-in-class devices for wound care management and skin restoration, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Results and Recent Business Updates**\n\n  * Commercial revenue of $19.5 million, an increase of approximately 44% compared to the same period in 2023\n  * Gross profit margin of 83.7%\n  * On July 31, 2024, entered into a multi-year development and distribution agreement with Regenity Biosciences that provides AVITA Medical with the exclusive rights to market, sell, and distribute Cohealyx™, an AVITA Medical branded collagen-based dermal matrix\n  * On November 7, 2024, amended the credit agreement with OrbiMed in a mutually beneficial arrangement, forgoing access to an additional $50 million in funding in exchange for removal of the 12-month trailing revenue covenant for the period ending December 31, 2024\n\n\n\n“Third-quarter commercial revenue surpassed our second-quarter record by 29%, underscoring the strength of RECELL GO as a transformative product and the success of adoption,\" said Jim Corbett, Chief Executive Officer of AVITA Medical. \"With over 75% of our revenue base now transitioned to RECELL GO and the anticipated launch of Cohealyx in 2025, we are positioned to address a broad continuum of wound care needs. We remain committed to establishing RECELL as the standard of care and transforming wound care, all while advancing our mission to improve patient outcomes and expand access.\"\n\n**Future Milestones**\n\n  * Anticipate FDA approval of RECELL GO mini by December 31, 2024\n  * Anticipate 510(k) clearance of Cohealyx before year-end; expect to launch in January 2025\n  * Anticipate initiating post-market clinical study to validate the preclinical work of Cohealyx in Q1 2025\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\n  * Commercial revenue for the fourth quarter 2024 is expected to be in the range of $22.3 to $24.3 million, reflecting growth of approximately 58% to 72% over the same period in 2023\n  * Commercial revenue for the full-year 2024 is expected to be within the previously provided revenue guidance of $68.0 to $70.0 million, reflecting growth of approximately 37% to 41% over the full-year 2023\n  * Confirming previously given guidance of achieving cashflow break-even and GAAP profitability no later than the end of Q3 2025\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nCommercial revenue was $19.5 million in the three-months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.9 million, or 43.8%, compared to $13.6 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. The growth in commercial revenue was largely driven by accelerating the transition to RECELL GO, as well as deeper penetration within existing customer accounts and new accounts for full-thickness skin defects**.**\n\nGross profit margin was 83.7% compared to 84.5% in the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease was due to ongoing engineering and validation of the RECELL GO durable and disposable cartridge.\n\nBARDA income decreased to zero, compared to $0.2 million in the corresponding period in the prior year, due to the ending of reimbursable clinical trials. BARDA income in the prior year consisted of funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under ongoing USG Contract No. HHSO100201500028C.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter were $30.2 million, compared to $21.1 million in the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of $4.6 million in sales and marketing expenses due to employee-related costs, including salaries and benefits, commissions, professional fees, and travel expenses, collectively, as a result of the expansion of the Company's commercial organization to support its growing commercial operations. G&A expenses increased by $3.5 million as a result of higher salaries and benefits, severance benefits, deferred compensation expenses, and professional fees, partially offset by lower other corporate expenses. In addition, the increase in operating expenses included an increase of $1.0 million in R&D costs, which was primarily due to employee compensation costs related to the Company's expanded team of medical science liaisons.\n\nInterest expense increased approximately $1.3 million in comparison to the same period in the prior year due to the interest expense related to the long-term debt incurred as part of the OrbiMed Credit Agreement, for a principal amount owed of $40.0 million.\n\nOther (expense) income, net decreased by $1.7 million to an expense of $1.1 million from income of $0.6 million in the prior period. In the current period, other (expense) income consists of non-cash charges of $1.0 million and $0.8 million related to the changes in fair value of the debt and warrant liability, respectively, offset by $0.6 million in income related to the Company's investments. The prior period income consisted of $0.7 million related to our investments offset by $0.1 million in other losses, net.\n\nNet loss was $16.2 million, or a loss of $0.62 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million, or a loss of $0.34 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $44.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nAVITA Medical will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (Friday, November 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Australian Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and recent business highlights.
