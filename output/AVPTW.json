By benchmarking against industry peers, organizations can see where they stand and what it takes to become an AI trailblazer.\n  * **Predictive Analytics:** To maximize and speed the time-to-value, AvePoint’s industry-first analytics help organizations assign licenses to individuals whose behaviors in Microsoft 365 predict high AI adoption. User-level activity data also identifies champions integrating AI into their daily functions and high-performance leaders spearheading change management.\n  * **Activity Scores:** To inform change management strategies, AvePoint provides granular visibility into activity levels for Microsoft 365 Copilot users, revealing under-utilization and adoption obstacles. Equipped with this information, organizations can tailor learning and development to foster sustainable usage and fuel AI transformation.\n\n\n\n“Realizing the full potential of AI requires a balanced approach that includes analyzing your AI adoption and identifying champion users to model the type of productivity and innovation you’re looking for,” said John Peluso, Chief Technology Officer. “But just focusing on that without ensuring your data is properly governed and secured could lead to immense challenges. With the AvePoint Confidence Platform, we offer organizations a comprehensive solution so that they do not have to choose between adoption, speed, and security.”\n\n[According to Gartner](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VEIPzElbrVnqP39Op9CacirqwKrpUrgyT64jBv4nfSAJlpEhCp_ooqkTNzoMCZjQwM01x4HjvW13Vrw-OpeAj6_ZgXY8wAtv7X1IBe6sng10Ej6RTeZR1na-UQi7OpHV18H3_40QFBhVGyjIkeyYNaoY45oyVOB5ljaZvzd1kTz1cLO3BMUBlQ1ww2l7gZ-0fFeeV1xH0IRhZt-ct3Xx6yccx6ZFF9p_ZKyBdH1k3pRIMtagJdv1wSHYIVLFMeDe0w4a_cOmtzH0Z2CmAAcWuE30KUor2y4Qz3lVbek_GPM=), at least 30 percent of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept due to poor data quality and inadequate risk controls, and by 2027, 60 percent of organizations will not realize the value of their AI investments due to incohesive governance frameworks.\n\nThe AvePoint Confidence Platform ensures long-term AI success with strong data governance and security solutions, including MyHub, an app that helps organizations manage their Microsoft 365 workspaces. [MyHub, which is already publicly available](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=I14ATn3cC4N6dkroyyyaLvfYUvaAAjEM7JI8sqJ7qYqDMk876jNU5C02uuTCul88gSUNh_ERMiHj1FS-zjY0Dr-MtxRoV8oNAJ0j-dmrjSNXqmuHLrzygN1OJ5Gxe6fusEimmkT__qqenHnCXIH-Gw==), now has new private preview features including risk assessments for data owners so they can manage permissions and address issues like sensitive file shares and oversharing links from their own Teams environments.\n\n“Our data governance solution MyHub brings data security to the business owner and allows them to apply the right business context to their data,” said John Hodges, Chief Product Officer, AvePoint. “When the burden of data security and governance is solely put on an IT team, it’s not only inefficient, but it can also be inaccurate, which is why we believe our enhancements to MyHub are critical and go beyond what’s currently in the market.\"\n\nWith over 21,000 global customers, 500+ PB of data managed and 240,000 governance operations managed daily, AvePoint provides a comprehensive solution for effective and secure AI integrations.

Our unmatched ability to meet this demand with the AvePoint Confidence Platform positions us well to capitalize on the tremendous market opportunity ahead of us and provides us the confidence to again raise our full-year expectations. We are excited for a strong close to 2024.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** : Total revenue was $88.8 million, up 22% from the third quarter of 2023. Within total revenue, SaaS revenue was $60.9 million, up 45% from the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Gross Profit** : GAAP gross profit was $67.6 million, compared to $52.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.

Non-GAAP gross margin was 77.0%, compared to 73.7% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Operating Income/(Loss):** GAAP operating income was $7.7 million, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $(0.3) million for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating income was $17.8 million, compared to $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.1%, compared to 12.8% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:** $250.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * **Cash from operations** : for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated $56.1 million of cash from operations, compared to $13.3 million generated in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Performance Indicators and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * ARR as of September 30, 2024 was $308.9 million, up 23% year-over-year.\n  * Adjusted for FX, dollar-based gross retention rate was 88%, while dollar-based net retention rate was 110%. On a reported basis, dollar-based gross retention rate was 87%, while dollar-based net retention rate was 109%.\n  * Announced the general availability of AvePoint Cloud Backup Express, designed to use Microsoft 365 Backup Storage for rapid and more efficient data protection, advanced in-product integrations, comprehensive security and compliance, and a multi-cloud security framework.\n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook** The company is again raising its full year outlook for total ARR, total revenues and non-GAAP operating income.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects:\n\n  * Total revenues of $86.5 million to $88.5 million, or year-over-year growth of 17% at the midpoint.\n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $12.6 million to $13.6 million.\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company now expects:\n\n  * Total ARR of $324.9 million to $326.9 million, or year-over-year growth of 23% at the midpoint.\n  * Total revenues of $327.8 million to $329.8 million, or year-over-year growth of 21% at the midpoint.\n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $45.8 million to $46.8 million, or a non-GAAP operating margin of 14% at the midpoint.\n\n\n\nWe have not reconciled non-GAAP operating income or operating margin guidance to GAAP operating income or operating margin because we do not provide guidance on these GAAP results, and because certain items that impact these measures, including stock-based compensation expense, are uncertain or out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Quarterly Conference Call**\n\nAvePoint will host a conference call today, November 7, 2024, to review its third quarter 2024 financial results and to discuss its financial outlook.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (including percentage of revenue figures), non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, and key metrics include annual recurring revenue, dollar-based gross retention rate, and dollar-based net retention rate. The company has included a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures provides a better representation as to its overall operating performance. The presentation of AvePoint’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for its financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and AvePoint’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n_Annual Recurring Revenue_. This metric is calculated as the annualized sum of contractually obligated Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) from SaaS, term license and support, and maintenance revenue sources from all active customers at the end of a reporting period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, and the active contracts used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. The company believes this metric further enables measurement of its business performance, is an important metric for financial forecasting and better enables strategic decision making. Because this metric does not have the effect of providing a numerical measure that is different from any comparable GAAP measure, the company does not consider it a non-GAAP measure.\n\n_Dollar-based Gross Retention Rate_. This metric is calculated by starting with the ARR from all active customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period ARR. The company then calculates ARR from these same customers as of the current period end, or Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes net contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. The company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based gross retention rate. The company uses this metric as a measure of its ability to retain existing customers, and believes it is useful to investors for the same reason. Because this metric does not have the effect of providing a numerical measure that is different from any comparable GAAP measure, the company does not consider it a non-GAAP measure.\n\n_Dollar-based Net Retention Rate._ This metric is calculated by starting with the ARR from all active customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period ARR. The company then calculates ARR from these same customers as of the current period end, or Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes net expansion over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. The company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. The company uses this metric as a measure of its ability to expand business with existing customers, and believes it is useful to investors for the same reason. Because this metric does not have the effect of providing a numerical measure that is different from any comparable GAAP measure, the company does not consider it a non-GAAP measure.\n\n**Disclosure Information**\n\nAvePoint uses the [https://ir.avepoint.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LDdRu2_Wdz3VCU40176f2eVaqI7oIvSlBKlhT9ufvM1mSgL7WsGcRBk73dzgc51yNoxLv87MsiT_CnfMJFbMXYdR2G5Itg7xzRNd4PophxjRj3P7ssBvABVGynSs_veX_Pb5UteIQjwHtX_itZBDNHQt_PS9R3Z-fWbA6EaQZMUz6NQRfIYZf5EBJb0UlP96tXhNraVymueUaO98hJEl6sPffuZKOG3dp4jfTUCnpAIFTkdtMb7LYFcMIcHM3ELLf2Q2OGvPiyOzIzH089KnDGYVOzBYKD6-kAyaZwSJVTM=) website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws including statements regarding the future performance of and market opportunities for AvePoint.

(hereinafter referred to as the “Company,” “AvePoint,” “we,\" “us” and “our”)\nincludes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that may constitute “forward-looking statements”\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section\n21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements, as well as descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that\ncould cause actual results and events to differ materially, may appear throughout this Quarterly Report, including in the following sections: “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report), “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”\n(Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report), and “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report). These risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to,\nthose described from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThese forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,”\n“opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. However, the absence of these words\nor similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events, or developments that we expect\nor anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth, sales, earnings, and statements expressing general views about future operating\nresults — are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and are based on the\nbeliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to, our management. Our management believes that these forward-looking statements are\nreasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak\nonly as of the date when made. Readers should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in the context of these risks and uncertainties. The important factors\nreferenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to investors.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result\nin the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements,\nwhether because of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or\npersons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to\ntime in our other SEC filings and public communications.\n3\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nPART I.

Nature of Business and Organization\nAvePoint, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as “AvePoint,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated as a New\nJersey corporation on July 24, 2001 and redomiciled as a Delaware corporation in 2006.\nAvePoint provides a cloud-native software platform that organizations rely on to optimize operations, manage critical data and secure the digital workplace. As\ncompanies around the world embrace the new normal of hybrid work, they must build and deliver a new, seamless workplace experience for knowledge workers,\ncentered around an extensive portfolio of SaaS solutions and productivity applications aimed at improving collaboration across the organization.\nOur principal corporate headquarters are located in Jersey City, New Jersey, with our principal operating headquarters in Richmond, Virginia and additional\noffices in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and\nthe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(the “SEC”) for interim financial information and include the accounts of the Company and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly\nthe financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any\nother interim period or for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes\nincluded in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 (“Annual\nReport”).\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report. There have been\nno significant changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nComparative Data\nCertain amounts from prior periods have been reclassed to conform to the current period presentation, including:\n• The reclassification of changes in earn-out and warrant liabilities to be included in other expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of income for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• The reclassification of interest income, net to be included in other expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported and the amounts of revenue and\nexpenses reported for each of the periods presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the\ndetermination of standalone selling price for revenue recognition, deferred contract costs, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and related\nreserves, purchase price in a business combination, and earn-out liabilities. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due\nto risks and uncertainties.\nForeign Currency\nTransaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included\nin other expense, net in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company maintains cash with several high credit-quality financial institutions. The Company considers its investments with original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are not subject to significant market risk. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank\naccounts which, at times, exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company maintains cash balances\nused in operations at entities based in countries that impose regulations that limit the ability to transfer cash out of the country. As of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, the Company’s cash balances at these entities were $11.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively. For purposes of the condensed consolidated statements of\ncash flows, cash includes all amounts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets captioned cash and cash equivalents.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nGoodwill\nNo events or circumstances changed since the acquisitions that would indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit is below its carrying amount. No\nimpairment was deemed necessary as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nWe defer sales commissions that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining or renewing SaaS, term license and support, services, and\nmaintenance contracts. Changes in the anticipated period of asset benefit or the average renewal term are recognized on a prospective basis upon occurrence.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs of $5.6 million and $15.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $4.6 million and $13.1\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our condensed consolidated statements\nof income. Deferred contract costs recognized as a contract asset in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were $55.4 million and $54.7 million as of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue from four primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance. Services include installation services,\ntraining and other consulting services.\nTerm license revenue recognized at a point in time was $9.9 million and $22.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nand $11.1 million and $24.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAccounts receivable, net is inclusive of accounts receivable, and current unbilled receivables, net of allowance for credit losses. We record an unbilled\nreceivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We have a well-established collection history from our direct and indirect sales. We periodically evaluate the\ncollectability of our accounts receivable and provide an allowance for credit losses as necessary, based on the age of the receivable, expected payment ability, and\ncollection experience. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was not material.\nWe record deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheets when cash is collected or invoiced before revenue is earned. Deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $142.3 million and $129.3 million, respectively. Revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue\nbalance as of December 31, 2023, was $103.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe opening and closing balances of the Company’s accounts receivable, net, deferred revenue and deferred contract costs are as follows:\nAccounts Deferred\nreceivable, Deferred contract\nnet (1) revenue costs\n(in thousands)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 94,067 $ 129,256 $ 54,675\nBalance, September 30, 2024 91,033 142,267 55,371\n(1) Includes long-term unbilled receivables.\nThere were no significant changes to the Company’s contract assets or liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 outside of its sales activities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be\ninvoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $363.7 million, of which $310.4 million is related to SaaS and term license and support revenue. We expect to\nrecognize approximately 61% of the total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees. To date, we have issued both stock options and restricted\nstock units. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost ratably over\nthe requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires highly subjective assumptions in order\nto derive the inputs necessary to calculate the fair value of stock options. To estimate the expected term of stock options, the Company considers contractual terms of\nthe options, including the vesting and expiration periods, as well as historical option exercise data and current market conditions to determine an estimated expected\nterm. The Company’s historical experience is too limited to be able to reasonably estimate an expected term. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a\ngroup of peer entities. Dividend yields are based upon historical dividend yields. Risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yields currently available on U.S.\nTreasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements not yet effective\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)” (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 is\nintended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendment in this\nASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the\nASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact\nASU 2023-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740)” (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires\ndisaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The amendment in this ASU\nis effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU\n2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n14\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n3.

Line of Credit\nThe Company maintains a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with HSBC Bank USA, National Association, (“HSBC”) as lender, for a\nrevolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million, with an accordion feature that provides up to $20.0 million of additional borrowing capacity the Company may draw\nupon at its request. The line bears interest at a rate equal to term SOFR plus 3.0% to 3.3% depending on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan\nAgreement). The line carries an unused fee at a rate equal to 0.5%. The line will mature on November 3, 2026. We are required to maintain a minimum Consolidated\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) as well as a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, tested by HSBC each quarter. The\nCompany pledged, assigned and granted HSBC a security interest in all shares of its subsidiaries, future proceeds and assets (except for excluded assets, including\nmaterial intellectual property) as security for the performance of the Loan Agreement obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is compliant with all\ncovenants under the line and had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit.\n7. Income Taxes\nThe Company had an effective tax rate of 5.9% and (106.5)% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and (204.5)% and\n(45.7)% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe change in effective tax rates for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 was\nprimarily due to the mix of pre-tax income (loss) results by jurisdictions taxed at different rates, the impact of foreign inclusions, stock-based compensation and changes\nin valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions.\nThe change in effective tax rates for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was\nprimarily due to the mix of pre-tax income (loss) results by jurisdictions taxed at different rates, the impact of foreign inclusions, stock-based compensation and changes\nin valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions.\nThe Company continues to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and\ncircumstances. In making such an assessment, management would consider all available supporting data, including the level of historical taxable income, future\nreversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n8. Leases\nThe Company is obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for office space. The initial terms of the leases expire on various dates\nthrough 2030.

Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We\nelected to combine fixed payments for non-lease components, for all classes of underlying assets, with our lease payments and account for them together as a single\nlease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities amounted to\n$5.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively.\nOther information related to operating leases is as follows:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of the lease liability:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 1,828 $ 1,659 $ 5,576 $ 5,324\nAs of September 30, 2024, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.6 years and a weighted average discount rate of 5.4%.\n17\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nAs of December 31, 2023, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.8 years and a weighted average discount rate of 5.6%.\nThe maturity schedule of the operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nYear Ending December 31:\n(in thousands)\n2024 (three months) $ 1,642\n2025 6,123\n2026 3,472\n2027 2,274\n2028 1,395\nThereafter 1,427\nTotal future lease payments $ 16,333\nLess: Present value adjustment (1,471)\nPresent value of future lease payments (1) $ 14,862\n(1) Includes the current portion of operating lease liabilities of $5.9 million, which is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, letters of credit have been issued in the amount of $0.8 million as security for operating leases.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of its business, the Company may be involved in various claims, negotiations and legal actions. Except for such claims that arise in the\nnormal course of business, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was not a party to any other litigation for which a material claim is reasonably possible, probable or\nestimable.\nIndemnification\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its executive officers and directors. These agreements, among other things, require AvePoint to\nindemnify its directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, specifically the Delaware General Corporation Law (as the same exists or\nmay hereafter be amended) for certain expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by a director or officer in any action or\nproceeding arising out of their services as one of the Company’s directors or officers or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at the\nCompany’s request.\nAs part of the business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation, Inc. (“Apex”), we assumed certain indemnification obligations for Apex\nTechnology Sponsor LLC and Jeff Epstein, Brad Koenig, David Chao, Peter Bell, Donna Wells, and Alex Vieux (the “Indemnitees” or “Defendants”). On February 2,\n2024, Drulias and Farzad (as purported Apex stockholders, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a class action complaint against the Indemnities in Delaware Court of Chancery,\ncaptioned Dean William Drulias, et.al. v. Apex Technology Sponsor LLC, et.al., C.A. No. 2024-0094-LWW. Plaintiffs asserted breach of fiduciary duty and unjust\nenrichment claims against the Defendants. The complaint alleged that Defendants made false and misleading disclosures in the June 2, 2021 proxy statement of Apex\nimpacting its stockholders’ vote to approve a merger between Apex and us and also affecting stockholders’ redemption rights prior to the merger. Plaintiffs sought\nunspecified damages, rescission or rescissory damages, and disgorgement of unjust enrichment. We were not a named defendant in the complaint but had\nindemnification obligations to the Defendants under indemnification agreements executed during the merger. Also, in accordance with the business combination\nagreement, the Defendants obtained insurance policies to cover post-closing liability, with Apex securing a policy with a limit of $10 million and the sponsors obtaining\na policy with a $3 million limit. The parties participated in a mediation in October and agreed to settlement terms. Pursuant to a signed letter of intent and a forthcoming\nsettlement agreement, releasing us and the Defendants and settling the class action, we will contribute $1.4 million toward the full settlement amount of $14.4 million.\nThe remaining $13 million will be paid pursuant to the two aforementioned insurance policies covering the Defendants and sponsor. As of September 30, 2024, an\nestimated accrual of $1.4 million was included in the accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nGuarantees\nIn the normal course of business, customers in certain geographies or in highly regulated sectors occasionally require contingency agreements for the\ncompletion of service projects, the completion of which are secured by certificates of deposit and a line of credit. The certificates of deposit are included in short-term\ninvestments within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, letters of credit have been issued in the amount of $3.7 million, as security for\nthe agreements. These agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n10. Earn-Out and Warrant Liabilities\nCompany Earn-Out\nCertain holders of common stock and certain holders of options shall be issued additional shares of AvePoint’s common stock, as follows:\n• 1,000,000 shares of AvePoint’s common stock, in the aggregate, if at any time from July 1, 2021 through July 1, 2028 (a) AvePoint’s stock price is greater than\nor equal to $12.50 over any 20 Trading Days within any 30 trading day period or (b) the Company consummates a subsequent transaction, which results in the\nstockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding $12.50 per\nshare;\n• 1,000,000 shares of AvePoint’s common stock, in the aggregate, if at any time from July 1, 2021 through July 1, 2028 (a) AvePoint’s stock price is greater than\nor equal to $15.00 over any 20 Trading Days within any 30 trading day period or (b) the Company consummates a subsequent transaction, which results in the\nstockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding $15.00 per\nshare;\n• 1,000,000 shares of AvePoint’s common stock, in the aggregate, if at any time from July 1, 2021 through July 1, 2028 (a) AvePoint’s stock price is greater than\nor equal to $17.50 over any 20 Trading Days within any 30 trading day period or (b) the Company consummates a subsequent transaction, which results in the\nstockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding $17.50 per\nshare.\nThe rights described above are hereafter referred to as the “Company Earn-Out Shares”. To the extent that any portion of the Company Earn-Out Shares that\nwould otherwise be issued to a holder of options that remain unvested at the date of the milestones described above, then in lieu of issuing the applicable Company\nEarn-Out Shares, the Company shall instead issue an award of restricted stock units of the Company for a number of shares of AvePoint’s common stock equal to such\nportion of the Company Earn-Out Shares issuable with respect to the unvested options (the “Company Earn-Out RSUs”). In evaluation of the Company Earn-Out\nShares and Company Earn-Out RSUs, management determined that the Company Earn-Out Shares represent derivatives to be marked to market at each reporting\nperiod, while the Company Earn-Out RSUs represent equity under ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Refer to “Note 13 — Stock-Based\nCompensation” for more information regarding the Company Earn-Out RSUs.\nIn order to capture the market conditions associated with the Company Earn-Out Shares, the Company applied an approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo\nsimulation, which involved random iterations that took different future price paths over the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares’ (as defined below) contractual life based on the\nappropriate probability distributions. The fair value was determined by taking the average of the fair values under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. The Monte Carlo\nmodel requires highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, and the expected term of the earn-out shares.\nSignificant increases or decreases to these inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability. Under this approach, the fair value of the Company\nEarn-Out Shares on July 1, 2021 was determined to be $29.6 million. The fair value was remeasured as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and was\ndetermined to be $29.9 million and $18.3 million, respectively, and included in the earn-out shares’ liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As a\nresult, $4.2 million and $11.2 million increases in liability were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $2.8 million\nand $6.8 million increases in liability were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and included as other expense, net in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of income. No Company Earn-Out Shares have been issued as of September 30, 2024. We estimated the earn-out shares fair value using a\nMonte Carlo model with the following significant unobservable assumptions:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTerm (in years) 3.75 4.5\nVolatility 50.0 % 55.0%\n20\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nPrivate Warrants to Acquire Common Stock\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company granted 405,000 private placement warrants with a 5-year term and an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Management has\ndetermined that the private placement warrants are to be classified as liabilities to be marked to market at each reporting period.\nThe private placement warrants are non-transferable and any transfer to an unrelated party would cause the warrants to be converted into public warrants.\nConsequently, the fair value of the private placement warrants is equivalent to the quoted price of the publicly traded warrants. Under this approach, the fair value of the\nprivate placement warrants on July 1, 2021, was determined to be $1.4 million. The fair value was remeasured as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and\nwas determined to be $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and included in the other non-current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As a\nresult, $0.3 million and $0.5 million of losses were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $0.1 million and $0.2 million were\nrecognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and included as other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 328,750 private placement warrants remained outstanding.\n11. Mezzanine Equity and Stockholders’ Equity\nThe Company has one class of capital stock: common stock. The following summarizes the terms of the Company’s capital stock.\nCommon Stock\nPursuant to the Company’s restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company was authorized to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.0001\npar value. There were 187,430,543 and 184,652,402 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Each share of\ncommon stock is entitled to one vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by the\nCompany’s Board of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors has not declared common stock dividends since inception.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) for\nthe Company to buy back shares of its common stock. Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company has the authority to buy up to $150 million of common stock\nvia acquisitions in the open market or privately negotiated transactions. The Share Repurchase Program will remain open for a period of three years from the date of\nauthorization and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company is not obligated to make purchases of, nor is it obligated to acquire any particular\namount of, common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased and\nretired 2,629,978 shares at an average price of $8.25 per share. The shares were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares. As a result, common stock\namount, additional paid-in capital, and accumulated deficit in the condensed consolidated balance sheet during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were\nreduced by $0.0 million, $9.7 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired\n5,983,651 shares at an average price of $5.62.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nSponsor Earn-Out Shares\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company modified the terms of 2,916,700 shares of common stock (“Sponsor Earn-Out Shares”) then held by Apex Technology\nAcquisition Corporation’s sponsor, such that such shares will be subject to the following vesting provisions:\n• 100% of the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares shall vest and be released if at any time through July 1, 2028, AvePoint’s stock price is greater than or equal to $15.00\n(as adjusted for share splits, share capitalization, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) over any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period; and\n• 100% of the remaining Sponsor Earn-Out Shares that have not previously vested shall vest and be released if at any time through July 1, 2028, the Company\nconsummates a subsequent transaction.\nThe Sponsor Earn-Out Shares are currently outstanding and receive all benefits of regular shares with the exception of the fact that the shares are held in\nescrow and restricted from transfer until the vesting conditions described above are met. Consequently, the shares are classified as equity. No Sponsor Earn-Out Shares\nhave vested as of September 30, 2024.\nPublic Warrants to Acquire Common Stock\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company issued 17,500,000 public warrants with an exercise price of $11.50. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one\nshare of AvePoint’s common stock and the warrants are exercisable from the date of issuance through July 1, 2026.\nOn August 27, 2024, the Company announced the commencement of an offer to purchase all of its outstanding public warrants at a price of $2.50 per warrant\nin cash, with an expiration date of September 26, 2024 (the “Offer”). On September 26, 2024, the Company announced that 1,596,314 warrants had been validly\ntendered and purchased, representing approximately 9.1% of the outstanding warrants, for a total amount of $4.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, 15,979,936\nwarrants remained outstanding.\n22\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders of MaivenPoint Pte. Ltd. (“MaivenPoint”), a\nconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, submitted notices of exercise of their put option to cause MaivenPoint to repurchase their shares at a price of $6.1 million. As a\nresult of the exercise, AvePoint’s ownership in MaivenPoint became 76.1%, with the remaining ownership interest held by an unaffiliated investor. Due to the\nownership percentage change, the Company adjusted the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest by multiplying the adjusted net assets of MaivenPoint by the\nunaffiliated investor’s new ownership percentage, resulting in a reduction to noncontrolling interest and increase in additional-paid-in capital of $6.4 million,\nrespectively, within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThere are no put options held by MaivenPoint’s remaining noncontrolling interest shareholders, and therefore, there is no longer any redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest in MaivenPoint as of September 30, 2024.\n12. Growth Equity Fund\nOn February 28, 2024, the Company and Lumens Capital Partners Ltd. (“LCP”) established A3V JV Co. (the “Venture”), with each owning an equal share of\nthe Venture. In addition, the Company entered into a separate agreement with LCP to form A3 Ventures Fund 1, L.P. (the “Fund”). The Fund is a Cayman Islands-\nexempted limited partnership, aimed at investing in companies in the growth equity phase and mature cashflow generating businesses with strong growth potential. The\nFund looks to invest in companies situated in enterprise software markets aligning with the professional expertise and geographical presence of both the Company and\nLCP.\nThe Venture wholly owns A3V GP Co., which serves as the general partner of the Fund. As a limited partner, the Company committed to contribute $50.0\nmillion to the Fund, to be called as needed, for portfolio investments, fees, and expenses of the Fund. The Company also participates in Fund establishment costs and an\nannual management fee equal to 2.0% of the total commitment. Any future repayment obligations will be triggered upon the receipt by LCP of profit allocations related\nto the Fund.\nAs of September 30, 2024, no portion of the Company’s $50.0 million commitment has been called or was callable, and the operations of the Fund and the\nVenture have not materially impacted the Company’s financial position, financial performance, or cash flows.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $1.9 million of management fee and establishment costs were included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $0.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of management fee and\nestablishment costs were included in general and administrative in the condensed consolidated statements of income.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n13. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company maintains the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of September 30, 2024, 27,210,325 shares remained for future issuance under\nthe 2021 Plan. To date, the Company has issued only stock options and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total stock-based compensation expense was $9.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total stock-based compensation expense was $29.8 million and $27.0 million, respectively.\nStock Options\nThe compensation costs for stock option awards are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718. Stock options vest over a four-year service period and expire\non the tenth anniversary of the date of award.\nOn March 5, 2024, the Company granted 469,920 options under the 2021 Plan. The Company estimated the grant date fair value of these stock options using\nthe Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nMarch 5,\n2024\nExpected life (in years) 6.1\nExpected volatility 55.9%\nRisk-free rate 4.1%\nDividend yield —\nTo estimate the expected life of stock options, the Company considered the vesting term, contractual expiration period, and market conditions. Expected\nvolatility is based on historical volatility of a group of peer entities. Dividend yields are based upon historical dividend yields. Risk-free interest rates are based on the\nimplied yields currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life. Based on these inputs, the grant-date fair value\nwas determined to be $2.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $8.4 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to all unvested options.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 25,195,045 options outstanding and 22,646,655 options exercisable with intrinsic values of $188.6 million and\n$177.8 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,502,820 options were exercised, with a total intrinsic value of $9.5 million.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nRestricted Stock Units\nUnder the terms of the 2021 Plan, we have issued restricted stock unit awards with a continuous employment condition only (“Time-Based RSUs”), and\nrestricted stock unit awards with a continuous employment condition that are also contingent on the Company meeting certain performance goals (“PSUs”, and together\n“RSUs”). Both types of RSU awards vest over a four-year period from the grant date.\n3,727,387 Time-Based RSUs and 502,676 PSUs were granted under the 2021 Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with a weighted-average\ngrant date fair-value of $7.52 per award. The compensation costs for RSUs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718. RSUs are measured at the fair market value\nof the underlying stock at the grant date. RSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had an aggregate fair value at vesting of $35.5 million. As\nof September 30, 2024, there was $60.0 million in unrecognized compensation costs specific to the unvested RSUs, to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.5 years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 10,031,797 unvested Time-Based RSUs and 502,676 unvested PSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair-\nvalue of $6.29 per award.\nCompany Earn-Out RSUs\nThe compensation costs for Company Earn-Out RSUs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718. In order to capture the market conditions associated with\nthe Company Earn-Out RSUs, the Company applied an approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation, which involved random iterations that took different\nfuture price paths over the Sponsor Earn-Out RSUs’ contractual life based on the appropriate probability distributions. The fair value was determined by taking the\naverage of the fair values under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. Under this approach, the grant-date fair value of the Company Earn-Out RSUs on July 1, 2021, was\ndetermined to be $2.5 million. The stock options underlying the Earn-Out RSUs vest over a four-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of award. If\nthe contingent milestones of the Earn-Out RSUs are not met by July 1, 2028, the holders of the underlying stock options will not receive the Earn-Out RSUs.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAvePoint, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n14. Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) as the price that would be received upon selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs\nused to measure fair value are as follows:\n• Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.\n• Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash Equivalents:\nCertificates of deposit $ — $ 1,565 $ — $ 1,565\nMoney market funds — 4,211 — 4,211\nU.S. treasury bills — 179,051 — 179,051\nShort term investments:\nCertificates of deposit — 171 — 171\nOther assets:\nCertificates of deposit — 38 — 38\nNotes receivables (1) — — 3,692 3,692\nTotal $ — $ 185,036 $ 3,692 $ 188,728\nLiabilities:\nEarn-out shares liabilities:\nEarn-out shares (2) $ — $ — $ 29,941 $ 29,941\nOther non-current liabilities:\nWarrant liabilities (2) — 871 — 871\nTotal $ — $ 871 $ 29,941 $ 30,812\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash Equivalents:\nCertificates of deposit (3) $ — $ 1,533 $ — $ 1,533\nMoney market funds — 4,423 — 4,423\nU.S. treasury bills — 171,841 — 171,841\nShort term investments:\nCertificates of deposit (3) — 3,721 — 3,721\nOther assets:\nNotes receivables (1) — — 1,840 1,840\nTotal $ — $ 181,518 $ 1,840 $ 183,358\nLiabilities:\nEarn-out shares liabilities:\nEarn-out shares (2) $ — $ — $ 18,346 $ 18,346\nOther non-current liabilities:\nWarrant liabilities (2) — 533 — 533\nTotal $ — $ 533 $ 18,346 $ 18,879\n(1) During 2023, the Company extended a credit facility to LCP with a total commitment of up to $5.0 million and maturities of greater than twelve months (the “LCP\nNotes Receivable”).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report)\n(“MD&A”) summarizes (and is intended to help the reader understand) the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity\nand cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023 (our “Annual Report”) and our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport.\nThird Quarter 2024 Business Highlights\n▪ Total annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) increased 23% year-over-year to $308.9 million as of September 30, 2024;\n▪ Total revenue increased 22% year-over-year to $88.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024;\n▪ SaaS revenue increased 45% year-over-year to $60.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024; and\n▪ Announced the general availability of AvePoint Cloud Backup Express, designed to use Microsoft 365 Backup Storage for rapid and more efficient data\nprotection.\nOverview\nAvePoint provides a cloud-native data management software platform that organizations rely on to manage and protect critical data, optimize IT\noperations, achieve meaningful cost savings, and efficiently secure the digital workplace. Companies around the world have adopted a hybrid work model, and they are\nnow tasked with delivering a seamless and secure workplace experience for knowledge workers, centered around an extensive portfolio of Software-as-a-Service\n(“SaaS”) solutions and productivity applications.\nThe adoption of a portfolio of solutions is a substantial and ongoing challenge for most organizations, which for decades had used only a small number of\nmulti-purpose on-premises applications to drive business outcomes. However, to deliver an efficient digital workplace today, companies must manage this range of\napplications – and the associated explosive growth and sprawl of critical data – with a platform offering that is well governed, fit for purpose, easy to use and built on\nautomation.\nIn addition, many organizations are beginning to realize the potential of generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) to drive competitive advantage and value\ncreation, including (1) extracting greater value from complex datasets, (2) making more informed business decisions, (3) reducing employee workloads, and (4)\nimproving the overall customer experience. While these data-driven improvements are expected to lead to stronger revenue growth and operational efficiency,\nsuccessfully leveraging this new technology is in turn dependent on first addressing data management challenges that all organizations face. Specifically, for AI-driven\nprojects to succeed, companies must apply robust strategies across the data estate to manage the information lifecycle, properly govern and secure their data, and ensure\nits compliance. These are the core business problems that AvePoint has been solving for more than two decades, and why we believe AvePoint is well positioned to be a\nkey enabler of generative AI adoption within enterprises in the coming years.\nAvePoint’s Confidence Platform empowers organizations – of all sizes, in all regions, and across all industries – to optimize and secure the solutions that most\ncommonly establish and underpin the digital workplace. As our customers seek to rapidly reduce costs, improve productivity and make more informed business\ndecisions, they depend on our platform for data-driven insights, critical business intelligence and ongoing operational value through automation.\n31\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nKey Business Metric\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nTotal ARR ($ in mil) $ 308.9 $ 250.6\nAnnual Recurring We believe ARR further enables measurement of our business performance, is an important metric for financial forecasting and better enables us to\nRevenue make strategic decisions on the business. We calculate ARR as the annualized sum of contractually obligated Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) from\nSaaS, term license and support, and maintenance revenue sources from all active customers at the end of a reporting period.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total ARR was $308.9 million and $250.6 million, respectively, representing growth of 23%.\nGrowth in ARR is driven by both new business and the expansion of existing business. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and\ndeferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, and the active contracts\nused in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\n32\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue We generate revenue from four primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance.\nSaaS revenues are generated from our cloud-based solutions. Term license and support revenues are generated from the sales of on-premise or hybrid\nlicenses, which include a distinct support component. Both SaaS and term license and support revenues are primarily billed annually. SaaS and term\nlicense and support are generally sold per user license or based upon the amount of data protected. SaaS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the\ncontract. For term license and support revenues, the license component is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made\navailable to the customer to download and use, and the support component is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.\nServices revenue includes revenue generated from implementation, training, consulting, license customization and managed services. These revenues are\nrecognized by applying a measure of progress, such as labor hours, to determine the percentage of completion of each contract. These offerings are not\ninherently recurring in nature and as such are subject to more period-to-period volatility than other elements of our business. Services revenue from\nmanaged services are recognized ratably or on a straight-line basis over the contract term.\nMaintenance revenue is a result of selling on-going support for legacy perpetual licenses. It also includes recurring professional services such as technical\naccount management. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, which is typically one year.\nCost of Cost of SaaS and cost of term license and support consists of all direct costs to deliver and support our SaaS and term license and support products,\nRevenue including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related expenses, overhead, third-party hosting fees related to our cloud services, depreciation\nand amortization. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred. We expect that these costs will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a\npercentage of SaaS and term license and support revenue from period to period.\nCost of maintenance consists of all direct costs to support our legacy perpetual license products, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and\nrelated expenses, overhead, depreciation and amortization. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred. We expect that cost of maintenance revenue\nwill decrease in absolute dollars as maintenance revenue declines but may fluctuate as a percentage of maintenance revenue.\nCost of services consists of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related expenses for our services organization, overhead, IT necessary to\nprovide services for our customers, depreciation and amortization. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred.\nGross Gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\nProfit and\nGross Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of our revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-\nMargin based hosting services for our cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and services organizations. We expect\nthat our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors but should increase in the long term as SaaS\nrevenue continues to increase as a percentage of total revenue.\nSales and Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for sales, marketing and customer success personnel, stock-based\nMarketing compensation expense, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, overhead costs, depreciation and amortization. We focus our sales\nand marketing efforts on creating sales leads and establishing and promoting our brand. Incremental sales commissions for new customer contracts are\ndeferred and amortized ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with such customers. We plan to continue our investment in sales and\nmarketing by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel, executing our go-to-market strategy globally, and building our brand awareness.\n33\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nGeneral and General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for finance, legal and compliance, human resources, and IT\nAdministrative personnel, as well as stock-based compensation expense, external professional services, overhead costs, other administrative functions, depreciation\nand amortization. Our general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with\nthe rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services.\nResearch and Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses incurred for our engineering and product and design teams, as\nDevelopment well as stock-based compensation expense, overhead costs, depreciation and amortization. We have a geographically dispersed research and\ndevelopment presence in the United States, China, Singapore and Vietnam. We believe this provides a strategic advantage, allowing us to invest\nefficiently in both new product development and increasing our existing product capabilities. We believe delivering expanding product functionality is\ncritical to enhancing the success of existing customers while new product development further reinforces our breadth of software solutions.\nOther Expense, Other Expense, net consists primarily of fair value adjustments on earn-out and warrant liabilities, realized gain/loss for securities, and of foreign\nnet currency remeasurement gains/losses.\nIncome Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,\nprinciples, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other\nconditions. The foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have different statutory tax rates than those of the United States. Accordingly, our effective\ntax rate could be affected by the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, use of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred\ntax assets and liabilities, applicability of any valuation allowances, and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.\n34\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nResults of Operations\nThe below period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nRevenue\nThe components of AvePoint’s revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 Amount %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue:\nSaaS $ 60,866 $ 41,910 $ 18,956 45.2%\nTerm license and support 14,140 16,293 (2,153) (13.2)%\nServices 10,810 11,194 (384) (3.4)%\nMaintenance 2,988 3,363 (375) (11.2)%\nTotal revenue $ 88,804 $ 72,760 $ 16,044 22.1%\nTotal revenue increased 22.1% to $88.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in SaaS revenue, which increased 45.2% to\n$60.9 million, and represented 69% of total revenue, up from 58% of total revenue in the prior year. The increase in SaaS revenue, which was driven by strong customer\ndemand for our SaaS solutions, was partially offset by an expected decrease in both term license and support and maintenance revenue.\nServices revenue is expected to fluctuate as the services generally are not recurring in nature. Additionally, maintenance revenue is expected to continue\ndeclining as we have shifted away from the sale of perpetual licenses and towards SaaS and term licenses. Without perpetual license sales, there will be limited\nopportunities to sell maintenance contracts to new customers. Existing customers have and will continue to transition to SaaS and term licenses, which will continue the\ndecline in maintenance revenue.\nRevenue by geographic region for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 Amount %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nNorth America $ 37,648 $ 31,751 $ 5,897 18.6%\nEMEA 26,298 21,739 4,559 21.0%\nAPAC 24,858 19,270 5,588 29.0%\nTotal $ 88,804 $ 72,760 $ 16,044 22.1%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, North America revenue increased 18.6% to $37.6 million, driven by a 46.2%, or $8.3 million, increase in\nSaaS revenue, partially offset by a combined $2.4 million decrease in term license and support, services, and maintenance revenues. EMEA revenues increased\n21.0% to $26.3 million, driven by a 41.5%, or $6.5 million, increase in SaaS revenue, partially offset by a combined $1.9 million decrease in term license and support,\nservices and maintenance revenues.

The effective tax rate was (106.5)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (45.7)% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The change in effective tax rates was primarily due to the mix of pre-tax income (loss) results by jurisdictions taxed at different rates, certain\njurisdictions with separate tax expense calculated, impact of foreign inclusions, stock-based compensation, and changes in valuation allowance.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company has considered all available positive and negative evidence including its historical levels of\nincome, expectations of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. If in the future, the\nCompany determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, the Company may set up a valuation allowance, which may result in income\ntax expense in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that, in addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin\nare useful in evaluating our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nNon-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures that our management uses to assess our overall\nperformance. We define non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income (loss) plus stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible\nassets. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenue. We believe non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating\nmargin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of\noperations, as these metrics eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation which has had historical volatility from period to period due to marked-to-market\nsecurities, and of acquired intangible assets, which are unrelated to current operations and are neither comparable to the prior period nor predictive of future results. We\nbelieve the elimination of the effect of variability caused by stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired assets, both of which are non-cash\nexpenses, provides a better representation as to the overall operating performance of the Company. We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical\nand prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to our peers, (b) to set and approve spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d)\nto measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, and (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures.\nNon-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, operating margin or any other\nperformance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of performance. Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of (i) non-GAAP operating income from the most comparable GAAP measure, operating income, and (ii) non-\nGAAP operating margin from the most comparable GAAP measure, operating margin, for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nGAAP operating income (loss) $ 7,652 $ (313) $ 2,313 $ (16,229)\nGAAP operating margin 8.6% (0.4)% 1.0% (8.2)%\nAdd:\nStock-based compensation 9,811 9,285 29,807 26,975\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 362 353 1,064 1,106\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 17,825 $ 9,325 $ 33,184 $ 11,852\nNon-GAAP operating margin 20.1% 12.8% 13.8% 6.0%\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $249.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $0.2 million in short-term investments.\nOur short-term liquidity needs primarily include working capital for sales and marketing, research and development, and continued innovation. In addition, we\nextended a credit facility with a remaining commitment of $2.5 million, and committed $50.0 million to a growth equity fund. We also have letters of credit issued in\nthe amount of $0.8 million as security for operating leases, and $3.7 million as security for customer contingency agreements. Our long-term capital requirements will\ndepend on many factors, including our growth rate, levels of revenue, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, market acceptance of our platform, the results of\nbusiness initiatives, and the timing of new product introductions.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nWe currently maintain a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), dated as of November 3, 2023, with HSBC Bank USA, National Association,\n(“HSBC”) as lender, for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million with an accordion feature that provides up to $20.0 million of additional borrowing capacity we\nmay to draw upon at our request. The line currently bears interest at a rate equal to term SOFR plus 3.0% to 3.3% depending on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio\n(as defined in the Loan Agreement). The line carries an unused fee at a rate equal to 0.5%. The line will mature on November 3, 2026. We are required to maintain a\nminimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) as well as a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, tested by HSBC\neach quarter. We pledged, assigned, and granted HSBC a security interest in all shares of our subsidiaries, future proceeds and assets (except for excluded assets,\nincluding material intellectual property) as a security for the performance of the loan and security agreement obligations.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, our cash flows from operating activities, and our borrowing capacity under our\ncredit facility with HSBC are sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may attempt to\nraise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would be dilutive to our stockholders. Additional debt\nfinancing could result in increased debt service obligations and more restrictive financial and operational covenants.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of AvePoint’s cash flows for the periods indicated.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 56,134 $ 13,284\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,369) (4,224)\nNet cash used in financing activities (28,218) (29,809)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $56.1 million, reflecting AvePoint’s net loss of $12.0 million,\nadjusted for non-cash items of $51.5 million and net cash inflows of $16.6 million from changes in its operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of non-cash\nitems were stock-based compensation which reflects ongoing compensation and an increase in the mark to market value of earn-out and warranty liabilities. The drivers\nof changes in operating assets and liabilities are seasonal in nature. These drivers are related to a decrease in accounts receivable due primarily to the timing of customer\ninvoices and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily related to prepaid software maintenance and subscription, an increase in deferred\nrevenue and an increase in accrued expenses primarily due to income tax payable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $13.3 million, reflecting AvePoint’s net loss of $25.9 million,\nadjusted for non-cash items of $43.9 million and net cash outflows of $4.7 million from changes in its operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of non-cash\nitems were stock-based compensation which reflects ongoing compensation and an increase in the mark to market value of earn-out and warranty liabilities. The drivers\nof changes in operating assets and liabilities are seasonal in nature. These drivers are related to a decrease in accounts receivable due primarily to timing of customer\ninvoices and decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily related to prepaid insurance, an increase in deferred revenue and a decrease in accrued\nexpenses primarily due to accrued bonuses, commissions and VAT/sales tax payable.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.4 million. It primarily consisted of $2.3 million of purchases of\nproperty and equipment, $1.9 million of purchases of short-term investments, $1.5 million investment in notes, and $0.9 million from the capitalization of internal use\nsoftware, offset by $5.4 million from the maturity of short-term investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.2 million. It primarily consisted of $2.1 million of purchases of\nshort-term investments, $1.5 million of purchases of property and equipment, and $1.0 million from the capitalization of internal use software, partially offset by\n$1.3 million from the maturity of short-term investments.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $28.2 million, primarily consisting of $21.7 million in repurchases of\ncommon stock under the previously announced Share Repurchase Program that authorizes us to repurchase up to $150 million of our common shares (the “Share\nRepurchase Program”), $6.1 million in the redemption of the redeemable noncontrolling interest of MaivenPoint, and $4.0 million in the purchase of our public\nwarrants, partially offset by $3.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $29.8 million, primarily consisting of $33.6 million in repurchases of\ncommon stock under the Share Repurchase Program, partially offset by $3.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nIndebtedness\nCredit Facility\nWe maintain a line of credit under Loan Agreement with HSBC, as the lender. See “Note 6 - Line of Credit ” in Part I, Item 1 “Financial Statements” of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe Loan Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million and an additional $20.0 million accordion feature for additional capital we\nmay draw upon at our request. Borrowings under the line currently bear interest at a rate equal to term SOFR plus 3.0% to 3.3% depending on the Consolidated Total\nLeverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The line carries an unused fee at a rate equal to 0.5%. Any proceeds of borrowings under the Loan Agreement will\nbe used for general corporate purposes.\nOn a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries, we are required to maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as well as a maximum\nConsolidated Total Leverage Ratio, tested by HSBC each quarter. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we pledged, assigned, and granted HSBC a security interest in all\nshares of our subsidiaries, future proceeds, and certain assets as security for our obligations under the Loan Agreement. Our line of credit under the Loan Agreement\nwill mature on November 3, 2026.\nTo date, we are in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Agreement. We have not at any time borrowed under the Loan Agreement. The description of\nthe Loan Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the form of such agreement, a copy of which is referenced as an exhibit to our Annual Report.\nLeasing Activities\nWe are obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for office space. The initial terms of the leases expire on various dates through 2030. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the commitments related to these operating leases is $16.3 million, of which $6.3 million is due in the next twelve months.\nOperating Segment Information\nWe operate in one segment. Our products and services are sold throughout the world, through direct and indirect sales channels. Our chief operating decision\nmaker (the “CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes operating performance assessment and resource allocation decisions on a global basis. The\nCODM does not receive discrete financial information about asset allocation or profitability by product or geography. See the section titled “Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements” (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) under the sub-heading “Note 15 – Segment Information” for more information.\n45\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We also make estimates and assumptions on the reported revenue generated and reported expenses incurred during the\nreporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that our management believes are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from\nother sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the section titled “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” (Part I,\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report), we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported\nfinancial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from four primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance. Many of our contracts with customers include\nmultiple performance obligations. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Our products and services generally do not\nrequire a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for\neach contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation within each contract.\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except term licenses, we are able to establish\nthe SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range\nfor our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Term licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that\nincludes the rights to a term license and support. In determining the SSP of license and support in a term license arrangement, we utilize observable inputs and consider\nthe value relationship between support and term license when compared to the value relationship between support and perpetual licenses, the average economic life of\nour products, and software renewals rates. Using a combination of the relative fair value method, or the residual value method the SSP of the performance obligations in\nan arrangement is allocated to each performance obligation within a sales arrangement.\nCompany Earn-Out Shares\nIn evaluation of the Company Earn-Out Shares and Company Earn-Out RSUs, management determined that the Company Earn-Out Shares represent\nderivatives to be marked to market at each reporting period, while the Company Earn-Out RSUs represent equity under ASC 718. Refer to “Note 13 — Stock-Based\nCompensation” for more information regarding the Company Earn-Out RSUs.\nIn order to capture the market conditions associated with the Company Earn-Out Shares, the Company applied an approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo\nsimulation, which involved random iterations that took different future price paths over the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares’ contractual life based on the appropriate\nprobability distributions. The fair value was determined by taking the average of the fair values under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. The Monte Carlo model\nrequires highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, and the expected term of the earn-out shares.\n46\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 2\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software while also deploying\ncompeting cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. Customer preferences evolve rapidly, and choices in hardware, products, and devices can and do\ninfluence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and\nadapt to keep pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure, research and development, marketing, and geographic expansion\nwill continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We\ncompete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career\nacross many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\nAdditionally, demand for our software and service is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic and currently include\nmultiple ongoing conflicts where the outcomes and consequences are not possible to predict, but could include regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and could\nmaterially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. These in turn could increase our costs, disrupt our supply\nchain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. Many of these revenues and expenses are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Refer to the section titled “Risk\nFactors” (Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur quarterly revenue fluctuates and does not necessarily grow sequentially when measuring any one fiscal quarter’s revenue with another (e.g. comparing the\nfourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2023 with the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2024). Historically, our third and fourth quarters have been our highest revenue\nquarters, however those results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly revenue or full year results. Higher third and fourth quarter revenue is driven primarily\nby increased sales resulting from our customers’ fiscal year ends. Additionally, new product and service introductions (including the timing of those introductions) can\nsignificantly impact revenue. Revenue can also be affected when customers anticipate a product introduction. Our operating expenses have generally increased\nsequentially due to increases in personnel in connection with the expansion of our business.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements, see “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 “Financial Statements”\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n47\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 3\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nWe are exposed to potential economic risk from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and our concentration of credit. We continued to evaluate our exposure\nto market risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and have determined that there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from\nthose described in our Annual Report. However, we have provided the following information to supplement or update our disclosures in our Annual Report.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and short-term deposits of $250.0 million, which we hold for working\ncapital purposes. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits and money market funds. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we believe that it\ndoes not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio due to changes in interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, would\nreduce our future interest income. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material negative impact on our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. To the extent we enter into other long-term debt arrangements in the future, we would be subject to fluctuations in interest rates which could have a\nmaterial impact on our future financial condition and results of operation.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these\namounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the\ncash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period,\nthe offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line\nitem in its condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We believe we are in large part naturally hedged against foreign currency exchange risk\nfrom our ongoing business operations, as most of our regional revenues are generated in the same currency as that region’s expenses are paid.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe deposit our cash with financial institutions, and, at times, such balances may exceed federally insured limits.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 4\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (in his capacity as “Principal Executive Officer”)\nand our Chief Financial Officer (in his capacity as “Principal Financial and Accounting Officer”), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that\nevaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as\nof September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness described below.\nNotwithstanding such material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting\nOfficer have concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results\nof operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nPreviously Disclosed Material Weakness\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As reported in our Annual Report, we did not maintain effective internal control as of December 31, 2023, as a result of a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for accuracy and completeness of information used. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual\nor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Refer to our Annual Report for a description of our material weakness.\n2024 Remediation Plan\nOur material weakness was not remediated as of September 30, 2024. Our management has been and continues to be committed to remediating this material\nweakness and has identified and implemented several steps to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting. We have implemented a remediation plan (the\n“2024 Remediation Plan”), which includes actions not limited to:\n■ enhance the design of controls that address the accuracy and completeness of reports being utilized in the execution of internal controls; and\n■ establishing additional training to address the accuracy and completeness of data used controls and the level of documentation required to evidence\ncontrol activities.\nWe have implemented documented policies and procedures for, and are in the process of testing the implementation and operating effectiveness of, the newly\ndesigned controls. The material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the newly designed controls operate for\na sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. In addition, we may discover\nadditional material weaknesses that require additional time and resources to remediate, and we may decide to take additional measures to address the material\nweaknesses or modify the remediation steps described above.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nItems 1 and 1A\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nAs part of the business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation, Inc. (“Apex”), we assumed certain indemnification obligations for Apex\nTechnology Sponsor LLC and Jeff Epstein, Brad Koenig, David Chao, Peter Bell, Donna Wells, and Alex Vieux (the “Indemnitees” or “Defendants”). On February 2,\n2024, Drulias and Farzad (as purported Apex stockholders, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a class action complaint against the Indemnities in Delaware Court of Chancery,\ncaptioned Dean William Drulias, et.al. v. Apex Technology Sponsor LLC, et.al., C.A. No. 2024-0094-LWW. Plaintiffs asserted breach of fiduciary duty and unjust\nenrichment claims against the Defendants. The complaint alleged that Defendants made false and misleading disclosures in the June 2, 2021 proxy statement of Apex\nimpacting its stockholders’ vote to approve a merger between Apex and us and also affecting stockholders’ redemption rights prior to the merger. Plaintiffs sought\nunspecified damages, rescission or rescissory damages, and disgorgement of unjust enrichment. We were not a named defendant in the complaint but had\nindemnification obligations to the Defendants under indemnification agreements executed during the merger. Also, in accordance with the business combination\nagreement, the Defendants obtained insurance policies to cover post-closing liability, with Apex securing a policy with a limit of $10 million and the sponsors obtaining\na policy with a $3 million limit. The parties participated in a mediation in October and agreed to settlement terms. Pursuant to a signed letter of intent and a forthcoming\nsettlement agreement, releasing us and the Defendants and settling the class action, we will contribute $1.4 million toward the full settlement amount of $14.4 million.\nThe remaining $13 million will be paid pursuant to the two aforementioned insurance policies covering the Defendants and sponsor. As of September 30, 2024, an\nestimated accrual of $1.4 million was included in the accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the normal course of our business, we may be involved in various claims, negotiations, and legal actions. Except for such claims that arise in the normal\ncourse of business, as of and for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we are not a party to any material asserted, ongoing, threatened, or pending claims, suits,\nassessments, proceedings, or other litigation for which a material claim is reasonably possible, probable, or estimable.\nRefer to the information under the section titled “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report (Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report) for information regarding the\npotential legal and regulatory risks (including potential legal proceedings and litigation) in which we may become involved.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual\nReport, which risks and uncertainties could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. There\nhave been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report. We urge you to read the risk factors in our Annual Report.\n50\nTable of Contents\nPart II\nItems 2, 3 and 4\nITEM 2.

Please go\nahead.\nJamie Arestia {BIO 19836110 <GO>}\nThank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to AvePoint's third quarter 2024 earnings\ncall. With me on the call this afternoon is Dr.TJ Jiang, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Caci,\nChief Financial Officer. After preliminary remarks, we will open the call for a question-and-\nanswer session.\nPlease note that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current\nexpectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in our press\nrelease for a more complete description. All material in the webcast is the sole property and\ncopyright of AvePoint with all rights reserved. Please note this presentation describes certain\nnon-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP\noperating income, and non-GAAP operating margin, which are not measures prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nPage 1 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nThe non-GAAP measures are presented in this presentation as we believe they provide\ninvestors with a means of understanding how management evaluates the company's operating\nperformance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as\nsubstitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A\nreconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is\navailable in our third quarter 2024 earnings press release, as well as our updated investor\npresentation and financial tables, all of which are available on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to TJ.\nTianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you to everyone joining us on the call today. The third quarter was\nan exceptional one for AvePoint as we built on the momentum and strength of the first half of\nthe year, outperforming our expectations for the seventh consecutive quarter. We also\ndemonstrated meaningful improvement on a number of key financial and operational metrics,\nwhich Jim will discuss in more detail.\nOur results, again, reflect our steady focus on profitable growth and the ongoing demand for\nthe AvePoint Confidence Platform, which is designed to enhance data security, governance, and\nresilience. While these customer needs are not new, they have never been as high-profile or as\nwidespread as they are today. Companies worldwide increasingly are turning to AvePoint as\nthey recognize the importance of high-quality data and the criticality of a robust data\nmanagement strategy.\nAvePoint's unmatched ability to establish these strategies for customers for more than 20 years\nmakes us a perfect fit for this moment, where companies are rethinking data security in the age\nof generative AI and prioritizing platform solutions that deliver automated value across their\nmulti-cloud environments. These dynamics position AvePoint exceptionally well to capitalize on\nthe tremendous market opportunity ahead of us. And provide us the confidence to again raise\nour expectations for the year.\nToday, I'll talk about what we are seeing in the market and some key customer wins in the\nquarter. I'll then turn it over to Jim to cover our financial performance and updated financial\nguidance. I recently attended the Microsoft SMC APAC conference, which brings together the\ntop Microsoft partners in the region. A key topic was maximizing the value of Microsoft 365\nCopilot. In every conversation, whether with members of Microsoft's Executive team or other\ntop partners, it was clear that data security and data quality are key to delivering the potential\nthat Gen AI solutions like Copilot offers.\nAt the same time, the concept of data security is rapidly evolving in the age of AI. It goes\nbeyond traditional security measures, extending to comprehensive data protection, quality data\nmanagement, robust data governance, and of course, data security. Traditional data security has\nfocused on protecting the parameter, but that approach, while still important, is ultimately\ninsufficient today. With the rise of Gen AI, businesses must shift to data-centric security, which\nfocuses on protecting the data itself wherever it resides.\nPage 2 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nWhat do we mean by this? Today, companies require a centralized data security posture,\nuniform approach to data governance, automated business processes, proactive and agile risk\nresponse, and the ability to do all these things at scale. Essential to this approach is the\nintegration of strong data governance and data protection practices. Effective governance\nensures that data is properly managed, accessible, and compliant with regulations, while data\nprotection measures, like encryption and access controls, secure sensitive information. Without\nthese practices, the true value of generative AI simply cannot be realized.\nGartner found that at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of\nconcepts by the end of 2025 due to poor data quality and inadequate risk controls. And by\n2027, 60% of organizations will fail to realize the anticipated value of their AI use cases due to\nincohesive data governance frameworks. Seamlessly addressing these widespread problems is\nprecisely what the AvePoint Confidence Platform solves. We enable security, business, and IT\nleaders to automate data governance for unstructured data, including the right security\ncontrols, business process automation, monitoring, and analytics to simplify data security and\nsuccessfully implement generative AI.\nOur Platform Approach, which offers a one-stop solution to the most universal data\nmanagement challenges, continues to resonate with customers and prospects and led to strong\nnew local acquisition and significant customer expansions in the third quarter. I want to\nhighlight a few of these wins, which encapsulate organizations of all sizes and verticals from all\naround the world. Financial institutions deal with vast amounts of sensitive unstructured data\nand the integration of AI capabilities for fraud detection, customer service automation, and risk\nassessments inherently introduces risks like data privacy breaches, unauthorized access, and\nbias in AI algorithms.\nThis is the exact use case leading to a significant customer expansion with a prominent global\nonline payment processing company. Already a customer of our resilient suite, the company\nrequired enhanced data security and governance measures before rolling out Microsoft 365\nCopilot to their 40,000 users. They purchased three control suite products to provide a robust\nand scalable framework that will drive the success of their AI transformation.\nWe also welcomed a Canada-based insurance company with 35,000 users as a new customer\nin the quarter, which required a robust solution to improve workspace governance attestation\nacross its environment. They purchased five products across our control suite to enable\ncomprehensive data access governance, real-time monitoring of their data security posture,\nand automation of their compliance reporting.\nSwitching to the healthcare industry, we're safeguarding patient data and complying with strict\nregulations is non-negotiable. To do so, companies must have robust automated data\ngovernance and resilient protection plans in place to uphold their organizational reputation and\noperational viability. We welcomed a U.S.-based healthcare provider with 35,000 users in the\nquarter, which purchased our entire control suite of products to address risks related to their\nsensitive data.\nWith that point, they can now implement a scalable framework to automate data governance,\nuncover actionable risk insights, and enable proactive policy enforcement, reducing data\nPage 3 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nsecurity risk and optimizing their operations. Complying with strict regulations is equally critical\nin the public sector where inadequate data management can result not only in breaches of\nsensitive citizen information and operational inefficiencies, but also undermine public trust and\ndisrupt the delivery of essential services.\nPublic sector institutions represent our largest overall vertical, and the team had another strong\nquarter signing new logos and expanding existing customers deployments. A major Japanese\nmunicipal government with more than 20,000 users implemented the entire control suite in the\nthird quarter, citing our ability to automatically govern data across their large and complex\ndigital environment and support their overall data management goals.\nSutherland[ph] was a key U.S. Agency responsible for overseeing judiciary operations, which\nfaced significant data protection challenges. With more than 30,000 users, their existing\nmanual backup process proved cumbersome and unreliable. And the recent loss of critical case\ninformation highlighted the need for a more robust solution, especially with increasing\nransomware threats. They chose AvePoint's FedRAMP-certified Secure Data Resilience product\nto implement an automated, reliable backup system that ensured data integrity and\ncompliance, in turn, positioning them to better protect critical information and respond to data\nloss and external threats.\nWe were also pleased that in the third quarter, a U.S. Federal agency responsible for\napproximately 2% of our total ARR meaningfully expanded their AvePoint commitment to\nanother 20,000 users. Today, they rely on our control and resilience suites to comply with the\nstringent regulatory requirements for their 115,000 users. As the AvePoint Confidence Platform\nenables them to address complex record management needs, identify and secure sensitive\ndata, and gain control over the workspace provisioning and information lifecycle management.\nThe other vertical I would like to quickly highlight is higher education.\nIn the third quarter, we had an eight-figure deal in APAC region with a prominent institution to\nreplace their on-premises system with a modern centralized enterprise student management\nsystem with a MaivenPoint platform. This would strengthen our role as a key provider of\ninnovative and mission-critical systems that meet the evolving needs of the higher education\nsector. While it's clear our solutions position organizations to deliver meaningful business\noutcomes in the future, we also can show them a substantial return on their investments right\naway.\nA great example of this is a leading global design and engineering consultancy based in the\nUK, which was utilizing a staggering one petabyte of data. This overuse was not only costly, but\nalso unsustainable, and they embarked on a rigorous selection process evaluating solutions\nfrom six different vendors. They ultimately choose the secure data protection and information\nmanagement solutions from our resilient suite, enabling them to quickly reduce their backup\ncosts as well as archive and delete their redundant and obsolete data.\nThis will immediately translate to substantial cost savings and a more streamlined data\nmanagement process. And we're already discussing additional products like tyGraph to further\nenhance their data management capabilities. This partnership exemplifies how the breadth of\nPage 4 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nour platform allows us to address multiple complex data challenges while delivering both\nimmediate and long-term value.\nTo conclude, AvePoint is uniquely positioned to address the critical challenges of data security,\ngovernance, and resilience. Our platform approach and our ongoing innovation differentiates\nus from the point tools in the market and ensures that our clients can drive transformative\noutcomes while effectively navigating a complex multi-SaaS digital landscape. I am extremely\nproud of the team's accomplishments this quarter, and we're excited for a strong close to the\nyear.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nThank you, TJ. And thank you to everyone for joining this afternoon as we report another\nquarter of strong results. This strength is evident not only as we review our performance against\nour guided metrics of revenue and operating income, but also as we go a level deeper and\nlook at our top-line results by geography, customer segment, and vertical, where the team's\nbroad-based execution translated into record net new ARR of nearly $19 million in the quarter.\nWe achieved this while closely managing every P&L line and driving significant year-over-year\noperating leverage, delivering record quarterly non-GAAP operating income of $17.8 million.\nAnd in turn, our improved profitability position has led to record cash flow generation as year-\nto-date we have generated $56.1 million in operating cash flow, and $53.8 million in free cash\nflow.\nI'll discuss these items in more detail shortly, but suffice to say, we are investing in profitable\ngrowth, executing on our strategic priorities, and strengthening our brand, all of which leave us\nwell-positioned to continue delivering value to AvePoint shareholders while we progress toward\nour Rule of 40 and GAAP profitability targets in 2025.\nWith that, let's turn to our results. For the third quarter ended September 30th, total revenues\nwere $88.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 22%, an acceleration from the second\nquarter and above the high end of our guidance. SaaS continues to be the driver of our overall\nbusiness. And in the third quarter, SaaS revenue was $60.9 million, growing 45% year-over-year,\nthe highest growth rate we have delivered in 11 quarters. We are also pleased that on a\nsequential basis, SaaS revenue grew 13%, the highest rate we have delivered as a public\ncompany. And in Q3, SaaS comprised 69% of total revenues compared to 58% a year ago.\nMoving to our other revenue lines, term license and support was $14.1 million, continuing its\nexpected decline, but representing a higher percentage of total revenues than in the first two\nquarters, given the typically higher demand for term license that we see from our North\nAmerica public sector customers in Q3. Maintenance revenue, which to remind you, is tied to\nour legacy perpetual licenses, also declined as expected year-over-year, both in dollars and as a\npercentage of revenues, and represented 3% of total Q3 revenues.\nPage 5 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nLastly, services revenue was $10.8 million, and represented 12% of total Q3 revenues, and\ncontinues to trend closer to our longer term target of 10%. And because services is our only\nnon-recurring revenue stream, our recurring revenue mix in the third quarter was 88%,\nrepresenting another record for the business.\nSwitching now to our regional performance, where the balance of our geographic footprint is\none of the many things that makes AvePoint unique within enterprise software. Today,\napproximately 40% of our revenues come from North America, 30% from EMEA, and 30% from\nAPAC. In the third quarter, we saw strong performance across the board, driven by our SaaS\nbusiness, which grew above 40% in all three regions. In North America, SaaS revenues grew\n46% year-over-year, and represented 70% of total North America revenues, which in turn grew\n19% year-over-year. In EMEA, SaaS revenues grew 41% year-over-year, and represented 84% of\ntotal EMEA revenues, which in turn grew 21% year-over-year.\nAnd in APAC, SaaS revenues grew 50% year-over-year, and represented 50% of total APAC\nrevenues, which in turn grew 29% year-over-year. The same broad-based strength is apparent\nwhen looking at our year-over-year growth in regional ARR, a metric we began disclosing this\nyear to provide a better view of the underlying momentum of the business everywhere we\noperate.\nIn Q3, North America ARR grew 20%, EMEA ARR grew 25%, and APAC ARR grew 27%, as each\nregion was a strong contributor to the 23% consolidated ARR growth we reported. Continuing\nnow with total ARR and other key metrics we assess on a quarterly basis. As of September 30th,\ntotal ARR surpassed the $300 million mark, ending the quarter at $308.9 million. As mentioned,\nthis represented year-over-year growth of 23%. As a result, net new ARR in Q3 was a record\n$18.8 million and grew 31% year-over-year, the highest organic growth rate we have delivered as\na public company.\nAdditionally, we ended Q3 with 629 customers with ARR of over $100,000, a 21% increase from\nthe prior year, and a net addition of 35 such customers from Q2, which represented the most\nwe have ever added in a single quarter. As of the end of Q3, 53% of total ARR came through the\nchannel, compared to 50% a year ago. And for Q3 specifically, 68% of our incremental ARR\ncame through the channel, compared to 61% for Q2 of 2024, and 72% for Q3 of 2023.\nTurning now to our customer retention rates. Adjusted for the impact of FX, our trailing 12-\nmonth gross retention rate for the third quarter increased to 88%. And we are pleased to see\nthis key metric improved to the highest AvePoint has reported to date. At the same time, our FX-\nadjusted net retention rate for the third quarter was 110%, an improvement from the 108% we\ndelivered a year ago and in line with Q2. On a reported basis, Q3 GRR was 87%, compared to\n85% in Q3 of 2023, and a one-point improvement from the prior quarter. Q3 reported NRR was\n109%, compared to 107% in Q3 of 2023, and in line with Q2.\nTurning back to the income statement, gross profit for Q3 was $68.4 million, representing a\ngross margin of 77%, compared to 73.7% in Q3 of 2023, and to 76.2% in Q2 of 2024. Similar to\nthe first half of the year, the improvement in our gross margin is primarily the result of our\nproduct mix in Q3 as we again had more SaaS revenue and less services revenue as a\nPage 6 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\npercentage of our overall revenue. In addition, we saw improved SaaS margins this quarter\ncompared to last year.\nMoving down the income statement, operating expenses for Q3 totaled $50.5 million or 57% of\nrevenues compared to $44.3 million or 61% of revenues a year ago. As a result, Q3 operating\nincome was $17.8 million or an operating margin of 20.1%, a year-over-year improvement of\nmore than 720 basis points. Q3 operating income was well ahead of our guidance and similar\nto last quarter, the outperformance was primarily driven by two factors. First, the meaningful\nrevenue beat, most of which flowed to the bottom line, and second, improved sales efficiency\nand prudent expense management across the business.\nThese areas of focus were most pronounced at the sales and marketing line, which represented\n31% of Q3 revenues and when looking at our total operating expenses, which as mentioned was\n57% of Q3 revenues. Both of these percentages were the healthiest we have reported as a\npublic company. Taken together, our ongoing commitment to profitable growth resulted in\nanother step on our path to full-year GAAP profitability and to this point we are pleased to have\nachieved GAAP profitability in the third quarter as well as for the first nine months of 2024 with\ncumulative GAAP operating income of $2.3 million. This compares to a GAAP operating loss of\n$16.2 million in the first nine months of 2023.\nTurning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, we ended the third quarter with $250\nmillion in cash and short-term investments and as mentioned, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30th, cash generated from operations was $56.1 million, while free cash flow was\n$53.8 million. This compares to cash generated from operations of $13.3 million and free cash\nflow of $11.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. During the three months ended September\n30th, we repurchased 219,000 shares for a total cost of approximately $2.6 million.\nI would now like to turn to our financial outlook, where for the full-year we are pleased to again\nraise our expectations for total ARR, total revenues, and non-GAAP operating income. For the\nfourth quarter, we expect total revenues of $86.5 million to $88.5 million, or approximately 17%\nyear-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income of $12.6 million\nto $13.6 million. And for the full year, we now expect total ARR of $324.9 million to $326.9\nmillion, or approximately 23% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This implies net new ARR\nfor the year of $61.4 million, or year-over-year growth of 23% at the midpoint. We now expect\ntotal revenues of $327.8 million to $329.8 million, or approximately 21% year-over-year growth at\nthe midpoint.\nAnd given these higher top-line expectations, again coupled with our outperformance on\nprofitability this quarter, we now expect full-year non-GAAP operating income of $45.8 million\nto $46.8 million, or an operating margin of 14% at the midpoint, which represents a year-over-\nyear expansion of 590 basis points. Lastly, on a rule of 40 basis, which for AvePoint is the sum of\nARR growth and non-GAAP operating margin, our updated guidance today reflects a 37. This\ncompares to the 29 that we initially guided for the year in February, to the 31 we guided to in\nMay, and to the 33 that we guided to in August. In summary, we are proud of our Q3 results,\nand the team remains laser-focused on profitable growth and continued execution as we\ndeliver value to organizations around the world.\nPage 7 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nThanks for joining us today, and with that, we would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator?\nQuestions And Answers\nOperator\n(Question And Answer)\nYes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) At\nthis time, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And the first question comes from\nJason Ader with William Blair.\nQ - Jason Ader {BIO 1878505 <GO>}\nYes, thank you. Hey, good afternoon, guys. First question, I guess, is if you would be kind\nenough to provide any relative growth rates across the different suites that you sell, that would\nbe helpful.\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nHey, Jason, it's Jim Caci. Thanks for the question. So I know that's something that we're\nproviding on an annual basis. I would say that for at least this point, at this point in the year, we\nwould expect to see the suites relatively similar to last year in terms of comparison. We are\nseeing additionally, and TJ even mentioned it in the script, much more focus around control\nfrom our customers. So we would expect to see improvement there. But overall, similar to what\nwe've seen in the past with, again, a little bit more focus on control.\nQ - Jason Ader {BIO 1878505 <GO>}\nOkay. Excellent. And then quick follow-up maybe for you, TJ, just as we think about the net new\nARR performance and the growth area of year, which was well above the total ARR growth. How\nwould you kind of summarize what's going well for you guys right now that's driving this net\nnew ARR performance?\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nHi, Jason. Thank you for your question. Yes, we are very excited to see the net new incremental\nARR growth. We have multiple strong segments. Historically, we're very strong in enterprise. We\nremain so. And as discussed in the past calls, our strongest, highest growth segmentation come\nfrom the SMB segment with our very laser focus on managed service providers as a\nsegmentation. So that continued to drive outsized net new logo acquisitions, as well as net new\nARR. And just go back to your previous point that Jim answered. So governance and security\nreally go hand in hand together. And governance is really our control suite. And security is really\nexemplified by the resilience suite. So we see a lot more of our platform strength and play that's\nhelping us really win in the market.\nPage 8 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nQ - Jason Ader {BIO 1878505 <GO>}\nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And the next question comes from Brett Knoblauch with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nQ - Brett Knoblauch {BIO 20597300 <GO>}\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the great quarter. It seems like\neverything is hitting on all cylinders. TJ, I was wondering if you could maybe point to one or two\nthings that you think is really allowing you guys to deliver the growth you're getting across all\nregions. It seems like all customer sizes. Is there any one or two things maybe the proliferation\nof AI that you could point to? Or how should we think about the continued strength there?\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nHi, Brett. Yes, that's a good question. We really do see consistent growth, high growth across all\nof our major three geographies in North America, EMEA and APAC. What's driving a lot of\ngrowth continue to be what we discussed in the previous quarters of this need for data\ngovernance and control. And, of course, around security and resiliency. So these things are\ncontinuing to be very, very strong growth vectors for us.\nAnd lastly, we also have our data migration, integration play in modernization that continue to\nbe a massive door opener for us. We see a lot more uptake in Microsoft, Gen AI capabilities. So\nthat led to migration opportunities as well from other clouds. So that would never end the\nmigration path between multi-cloud environments, between multi-hyperscalers. And even\nwithin same cloud platforms, there's always divestitures, M&As, and re-consolidation of tenants\nand split up tenants. So that continued to be the tip of the spear for us. So yes, we're pleased to\nsee all three major product suites and function areas on our SaaS competence platform to grow\nvery strongly across our regions.\nQ - Brett Knoblauch {BIO 20597300 <GO>}\nPerfect, thanks. And Jim, a question for you on the gross retention. I think it was the first time we\nsaw that tick up since you guys first started disclosing it a little bit ways back. Any thing you can\npoint to that kind of drove that tick up? And is that something we should expect to continue to\nimprove over the immediate term? Or I guess your 90% target there over what timeframe\nshould we expect that?\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nYes, great question. So you're right, that 90% target is, I would say at this point, probably a\nmedium term. So we're looking at the next couple of years of trying to get to that 90%. So we\nwere definitely encouraged to see us tick up here 1% to get to 88%. I think we're seeing good\nperformance really from each region. Strong performance in Q3 in our public sector, which\nPage 9 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\ncontinues to outperform kind of the consolidated results both in GRR and NRR. So that was a\ngood contributor.\nWe've also made some changes this year in terms of how we think about the long tail, kind of\nthat ARR base that doesn't receive dedicated CS is maybe a little bit lower in terms of ARR\nbalance. But we've done a bunch of things around pulled CS really focusing on how we can\nservice that team and that really customer base better. And we've seen already the first nine\nmonths of this year, we've seen improvement, and we've seen some meaningful improvement\nin terms of that GRR base. So that was definitely a contributor. And we're again, we're investing\nheavily there. So we would expect to see that continue. So I think we've made good progress\ntoward that 90%. And we're going to continue to work toward that and hopefully in the next\ncouple of years, we get there.\nQ - Brett Knoblauch {BIO 20597300 <GO>}\nPerfect, thanks. I really appreciate it. And congrats again on the quarter.\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nThanks, Brett.\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nThanks, Brett.\nOperator\nThank you. And the next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.\nQ - Nehal Chokshi {BIO 16526682 <GO>}\nYes. Thank you. Congrats on the great results. Hey, TJ, so you've talked about how Gen AI\ntransforms security needs to be data security centric, which I believe is more focused on your\nresilience suite. And I get that you say that they are the resiliency and control suite work hand in\nhand with respect to AI. But how does Gen AI transform privilege access from user centric to\ndata centric, which would be more focused around your control suite?\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nHey, Nehal, great question. So there's actually a lot of access control and privilege access\nflavors when it comes to specifically Microsoft 365 Copilot. So because, that's actually it's very\nmuch tied to the Office graph. So the access of particular assets in the cloud and what kind of\nassets you have, it's very important. And that's what drives the Copilot recommendations to a\nparticular user.\nSo we've seen very large, obviously, experimentations, but also now increasingly a few large\nenterprise wide deployments of Microsoft 365 Copilot on the premises of deploying our\nPage 10 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\ncontrol suite. So we actually announced this in the previous earning as well with a major global\nfinancial institution. And in this quarter, we continue to see that with a major customer take up.\nSo it does go together both from a permission management, lifecycle governance, as well as\nsecurity in the resilience side. So they do really it's not just the actual data itself, the quality\ncontrol, essentially maintaining a high quality data state, but also the access rights management\nof that too.\nQ - Nehal Chokshi {BIO 16526682 <GO>}\nOkay. And then thanks. Thanks, TJ. Jim, did you give the what was the FX impact on the\nreported ARR?\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nThe FX impact? No, we didn't disclose that, but it's about 1%. The ARR would have been slightly\nhigher by about 1%.\nQ - Nehal Chokshi {BIO 16526682 <GO>}\nGreat. Thank you.\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nThanks, Nehal.\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nGreat. Thanks, Nehal.\nOperator\nThank you. And the next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nQ - Kirk Materne {BIO 5771115 <GO>}\nYes. Thanks very much and congrats on the results. TJ, I don't know if you would parse this out,\nbut I was curious, how much do you think the acceleration is sort of you all getting reprioritized\nhigher in the IT spending budget versus budgets just getting a little bit more more unlocked.\nI'm sure there's a little bit of perhaps both going on, but I was just kind of curious how much of\nthis is really about your products getting pulled faster to the top of the spending list versus sort\nof a little bit of a macro unlock potentially?\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nYes, Kirk, that's a great question. There is, you're definitely right. There's definitely a little bit of\nboth. Initially, when you talk about AI experimentations, a lot of firms actually using a separate\nbucket of budget outside of traditional IT spend to do the experimentation. And once that\nPage 11 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nhappens to the extent that the firm decided to do a firm wide rollout, especially around a\n(inaudible) Copilot that's tied to their Office 365, Microsoft Office Cloud spend, then it actually\nprimarily goes into a primary bucket.\nSo it's happening on both sides of the house. It does highlight the need for the importance of\ngovernance and control and lifecycle management, something that traditionally only regulated\nindustry, enterprises and government care a lot about, but also everybody cares about it\nbecause as we know, your AI is only as good as the quality of your data. So that's definitely\nraising the priority for all the companies that want to deploy AI to be mindful of their data\nquality and data state. We actually cited a number of statistics from Gartner's and others to say\nthe quality of the AI experimentation and success rates that folks are seeing are really directly\ntied to their overall data management posture. So this is definitely raising the awareness across\nindustries.\nQ - Kirk Materne {BIO 5771115 <GO>}\nOkay. And Jim, just a quick one for you. The implied guide for, or just the guide for fourth\nquarter operating margins, is that sort of a baseline to think about as we think about next year,\njust in terms of how you want to start the year? I wasn't sure if there's any, obviously revenue\nwould be dropped down this quarter. So the guide's lower for next quarter. Just how should we\nthink about sort of incremental expenses coming into next quarter and perhaps sort of how we\nshould think about to start counter '25, knowing you're not giving official guidance?\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nYes, great point. Yes, we'll provide the guidance for next year, probably in February, but it's a\ngood point. We definitely are guiding lower for operating income in Q4. I don't know if I'd read\na ton into that in terms of the expectation moving forward. I think if you look historically, Q4 for\nus has been a higher spend quarter, and that's a combination really of how we budget and how\nsome of our, what we refer to as programmatic spend.\nWe definitely have more marketing spend in Q4 and some other initiatives. It's just not\nnecessarily linear throughout the year. So there's definitely some ebbs and flows and Q4\nhistorically has been a higher spend quarter, and that's going to continue this year. So that's\nreally a function. We also mentioned that we had about a million dollars of spend moved from\nQ3 into Q4. So that's also a contributing factor.\nQ - Kirk Materne {BIO 5771115 <GO>}\nThank you.\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nThanks, Kirk.\nOperator\nThank you. And the next question comes from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\nPage 12 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nQ - Analyst\nGreat. Thanks, guys. This is Cole on for Derrick. Great quarter. TJ, one for you. There's been a lot\nof buzz around AI agents the past couple of months. How do you think these are going to\nshape demand for control suite going forward? Do you see adoption of agents as kind of this\nincremental driver on top of Copilot? I'd love to get more color on that.\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nYes, that's a great question. Agents will continue to evolve. It's still in very, very early stages. If\nyou can't get a good quality output from your current AI deployments, given poor data,\ndeploying agents would just make it even worse because there's so much more automation\nintroduced. I would say that what this actually new development and new areas and trending,\nit's very exciting for us as overall a B2B SaaS provider in that I really think in the next three to\nfive years, fundamentally, the way software are being deployed, not only just developed, now\neveryone is using GitHub, Copilot, those type of AI-accelerated dev tools, it's going to change\nwith agents introduction.\nSo, the way software is actually going to be deployed out there will change drastically in the\nnext few years. But right now, we're still in very early endings of agents. And again, it points to if\nyou want to introduce more automation, intelligent automation, you need to get a core and\nfoundation right. This is why we're becoming more mission critical with that whole data estate\nmanagement and quality management.\nQ - Analyst\nGreat. Really helpful. And then, Jim, maybe one for you. Good margin on performance. You\ncalled out in the prepared remarks a couple of points. I just want to dig in on the improved\nsales efficiency. Is that just kind of a natural step as reps get more ramped and get more\nproductive? Are there any kind of specific initiatives that are driving this? Thanks.\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nYes, no, great question. And I think it's a little bit of everything you just said. We definitely are\nseeing better productivity from our reps. I think we pointed that out in the prior two quarters as\nwell. We've seen that in terms of rep productivity of our longer term reps, but also our newer\nreps ramping faster and getting the first sale faster. So, that's definitely been a factor. And then I\nthink it's also the continued maturing of our channel strategy. We pointed out, obviously, more\nand more business coming through the channel. And I think for us, that's a much more efficient\nplay as well. And I think you're seeing all of that kind of play into our progress.\nQ - Analyst\nGreat, thanks guys. Congrats again.\nA - Jim Caci {BIO 18051667 <GO>}\nPage 13 of 14\nFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-11-07\nAvePoint Inc (AVPT US Equity)\nThank you.\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the\nconference back over to TJ Jiang for any closing comments.\nA - Tianyi Jiang {BIO 20151191 <GO>}\nThank you for joining us today. Our strong third quarter results underscore our ability to help\ncustomers and partners achieve AI driven transformation with comprehensive and scalable data\nmanagement and governance solutions. Our platform approach and ongoing innovation\nuniquely positioned AvePoint to tackle the critical challenges of data security, governance and\nresilience in today's complex multi SaaS digital landscape.\nIn meeting with our management teams, customers and partners worldwide over the last\nseveral weeks, I'm confident we have the right market position, technology and people to close\n2024 strong and seize the massive opportunities ahead of us. We look forward to speaking with\nyou more this quarter. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Our unmatched ability to meet this demand with the AvePoint Confidence Platform positions us well to capitalize on the tremendous market opportunity ahead of us and provides us the confidence to again raise our full-year expectations.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (including percentage of revenue figures), non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, and key metrics include annual recurring revenue, dollar-based gross retention rate, and dollar-based net retention rate. The company has included a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures provides a better representation as to its overall operating performance. The presentation of AvePoint’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for its financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and AvePoint’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n_Annual Recurring Revenue_. This metric is calculated as the annualized sum of contractually obligated Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) from SaaS, term license and support, and maintenance revenue sources from all active customers at the end of a reporting period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, and the active contracts used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. The company believes this metric further enables measurement of its business performance, is an important metric for financial forecasting and better enables strategic decision making. Because this metric does not have the effect of providing a numerical measure that is different from any comparable GAAP measure, the company does not consider it a non-GAAP measure.\n\n_Dollar-based Gross Retention Rate_. This metric is calculated by starting with the ARR from all active customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period ARR. The company then calculates ARR from these same customers as of the current period end, or Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes net contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. The company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based gross retention rate. The company uses this metric as a measure of its ability to retain existing customers, and believes it is useful to investors for the same reason. Because this metric does not have the effect of providing a numerical measure that is different from any comparable GAAP measure, the company does not consider it a non-GAAP measure.\n\n_Dollar-based Net Retention Rate._ This metric is calculated by starting with the ARR from all active customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period ARR. The company then calculates ARR from these same customers as of the current period end, or Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes net expansion over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. The company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. The company uses this metric as a measure of its ability to expand business with existing customers, and believes it is useful to investors for the same reason. Because this metric does not have the effect of providing a numerical measure that is different from any comparable GAAP measure, the company does not consider it a non-GAAP measure.\n\n**Disclosure Information**\n\nAvePoint uses the [https://ir.avepoint.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LDdRu2_Wdz3VCU40176f2eVaqI7oIvSlBKlhT9ufvM1mSgL7WsGcRBk73dzgc51yNoxLv87MsiT_CnfMJFbMXYdR2G5Itg7xzRNd4PophxjRj3P7ssBvABVGynSs_veX_Pb5UteIQjwHtX_itZBDNHQt_PS9R3Z-fWbA6EaQZMUz6NQRfIYZf5EBJb0UlP96tXhNraVymueUaO98hJEl6sPffuZKOG3dp4jfTUCnpAIFTkdtMb7LYFcMIcHM3ELLf2Q2OGvPiyOzIzH089KnDGYVOzBYKD6-kAyaZwSJVTM=) website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws including statements regarding the future performance of and market opportunities for AvePoint.
