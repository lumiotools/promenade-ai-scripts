This proxy statement describes the proposals that will be presented for consideration by the\nshareholders at the Annual Meeting. It also provides information concerning those proposals to assist you in making\nan informed decision.\nWhy did you receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of paper copies\nof the proxy materials?\nWe are using the SEC notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy materials on the internet to\nour shareholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each shareholder. As a result, beginning on or\nabout April 5, 2024, we sent our shareholders the Notice by mail with instructions on how to access our proxy\nmaterials on the internet and vote online. The Notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If\nyou received the Notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the\nmaterials by following the instructions on the Notice or on the website referred to in the Notice.\nWho may vote at the Annual Meeting?\nThe proxy materials are provided to holders of record of our common stock on the Record Date. Only the\ncommon shareholders of record on the Record Date may vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there\nwere 43,354,718 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nHow can you vote?\nYou may own your shares of our common stock in one or more of the following ways:\n• Directly in your name as shareholder of record; or\n• Indirectly through a broker, bank, or other holder of record (your “nominee”), commonly referred\nto as in “street name.”\nFor shares of which you are the shareholder of record, you may vote your shares on the internet, by\ntelephone, or by requesting a proxy card and completing, signing, and returning it in the postage-paid envelope that\nwill be provided. Simply follow the instructions provided on the Notice or proxy card. You may also vote during the\nAnnual Meeting. Execution of a proxy card or voting via the internet or by telephone will not affect your right to\nattend the Annual Meeting.\nHowever, if your shares are held in street name, please follow the instructions provided by your nominee\non the voting instruction form or Notice in order to vote your shares. The method by which you may vote your\nshares (e.g., by internet or telephone) may depend on the voting process of your nominee. If you desire to vote at the\nAnnual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your nominee. Please contact your nominee for instructions\nregarding obtaining a legal proxy. As provided above, the Annual Meeting will be in person and there will not be a\nvirtual meeting.\nWhat happens if you do not give specific voting instructions?\nShareholders of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and you (a) indicate when voting on the internet\nor by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board or (b) sign and return a proxy card without\ngiving specific voting instructions, then the persons named as proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner\nrecommended by the Board on all proposals presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may\ndetermine in their judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting.\nShares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in street name and you do not provide your nominee\nwith specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, your nominee may generally vote on routine matters\nbut cannot vote on non-routine matters. If your nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your\nshares on a non-routine matter, your nominee will inform us that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter\nwith respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.” For the Annual Meeting, each of the\n2\nelection of directors and say-on-pay advisory vote are considered a non-routine matter but the ratification of the\nappointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter.\nCan you change your vote after you return the proxy card or after voting electronically?\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before it is\nvoted. Prior to the applicable cutoff time, you may change your vote using the internet, in which case only your\nlatest internet proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. You may also revoke your proxy and\nchange your vote by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form dated as of a later date, or by\nattending the meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the meeting will not automatically revoke\nyour proxy unless you properly vote at the Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked\nby delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary prior to the Annual Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in street name, you may revoke your proxy by following instructions provided by\nyour nominee.\nNo notice of revocation or later-dated proxy will be effective until received by our Secretary at or prior to\nthe Annual Meeting.\nWhat options do you have in voting on each proposal?\nYou may vote “FOR” or “WITHHOLD” with respect to the election of each director nominee.\nYou may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST,” or “ABSTAIN” with respect to the say-on-pay advisory vote, the\nratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and any other matter that may\nproperly be brought before the meeting.\nWhat is the quorum required for each proposal?\nThe holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the Record Date, represented\nin person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for purposes of such proposal at the Annual Meeting. If less than a\nmajority of the shares of our common stock are represented at the meeting, a majority of the shares represented may\nadjourn the meeting at any time.\nAs of the Record Date, there were 43,354,718 shares of our common stock outstanding. Therefore, at least\n21,677,340 shares need to be represented to constitute a quorum.\nHow many votes are needed for approval of each proposal?\nOur directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. This means that the\nnominees for director receiving the largest number of votes cast “FOR” will be elected up to the maximum number\nof directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve until the Company’s 2025 annual meeting of shareholders\nand until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation, removal, or\ndeath.\nRatification of the selection of FORVIS, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm requires\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. If the appointment of FORVIS, LLP is not\nratified, the matter of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm will be considered by\nthe Board’s Audit Committee.\nHow are abstentions and broker non-votes treated?\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are counted in determining the votes present at the Annual Meeting.\nHowever, a nominee has limited authority to vote on the election of directors and say-on-pay, but is not limited as to\nthe ratification of the selection of FORVIS, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWith respect to the election of directors, abstentions, broker non-votes, and votes to “WITHHOLD” for a\nnominee will result in such nominee receiving fewer votes but will not affect the outcome of the election. With\nrespect to say-on-pay and the ratification of the selection of FORVIS, LLP, abstentions and broker non-votes have\nthe same effect as a vote against the proposal.\n3\nWho will pay for the costs involved in the solicitation of proxies?\nWe will pay all costs of preparing, assembling, and distributing the proxy materials, including printing and\nmailing any copy of this proxy statement requested by a shareholder. In addition to solicitations by mail, directors\nand officers of the Company and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies personally, by telephone, email, or in person,\nbut such persons will not be specially compensated for their services.\nOther Matters Related to the Meeting\nOnly matters brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with our Second Amended and Restated\nBy-Laws (“By-Laws”) will be considered. Aside from the items listed above in the Notice of Annual Meeting, we\ndo not know of any other matters that will be presented at the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters\nproperly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment, the proxy holders will vote them in accordance with\ntheir best judgment.\nEach of the Board’s nominees for director has consented to serving as a director of the Company. Should\nany nominee for director become unable or unwilling to accept nomination or election, the persons acting under the\nproxy intend to vote for the election of another person recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee and nominated by the Board. We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees for director will be\nunable or unwilling to serve if elected to office.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nGenerally, the Board oversees our business and monitors the performance of our management. In\naccordance with our corporate governance procedures, the Board does not involve itself in our day-to-day\noperations, which are monitored by our executive officers and management. Our directors fulfill their duties and\nresponsibilities by attending regular meetings of the Board, with additional special meetings held from time to time.\nOur directors also discuss business and other matters with our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Petrie, and\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunlap, and other key executive officers, as well as our principal\nexternal advisers (legal counsel, auditors, and other consultants) at times other than regularly scheduled meetings\nwhen appropriate.\nThe Board has four (4) established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its\nresponsibilities. These committees are: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Risk. The\nBoard also may establish such other committees as it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable laws and\nregulations and our Articles and By-Laws.\nThe Board held six (6) regularly scheduled and special meetings during 2023. In 2024, the Board intends to\nmeet at least four (4) times, with additional special meetings held from time to time when necessary, and through\ncommittee membership, which is discussed below. During 2023, all directors attended at least 75 percent of the\nmeetings of the Board and the committees on which they served. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding\ndirector attendance at the annual meeting, we encourage and expect all of our directors to attend. All of the directors\nwere present at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.\nIn addition to meetings of the Board, our directors voluntarily attend regular meetings of management level\ncommittees to gain insight into our businesses’ current and future activities and strategies.\nDirector Independence\nUnder the rules of Nasdaq and the SEC, the Board has determined that six (6) of the current eleven\n(11) directors qualify as independent directors: Ms. Catchings, Ms. Gilroy, Mr. Juster, Mr. O’Brien, Ms. Sellers, and\nMr. Shane.\nMessrs. Petrie, Dunlap, and Evans do not qualify as independent directors because each is an executive\nofficer. Mr. Rogers does not qualify as an independent director because he is an employee. Mr. Dinwiddie does not\nqualify as an independent director because he is a partner at Dinsmore & Shohl, LLP, a law firm with which we\nhave a substantial relationship.\nA director or nominee that is not employed by us is referred to as a “Non-Executive Director.”\n4\nThe Board has a Chairman whose duties are described in our By-Laws. The Board may select any of its\nmembers as its Chairman and has no formal policy as to whether our Chief Executive Officer will serve as Chairman\nor whether any other director, including a non-employee or independent director, may be elected to serve as\nChairman. At present, the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are both held by Mr. Petrie. The Board\nbelieves that Mr. Petrie, as a co-founder, is best situated to serve as Chairman because of his familiarity with the\nCompany’s business and because he is the most capable of effectively identifying strategic opportunities and leading\nthe execution of our business strategy.\nHowever, the Board has adopted a written charter to govern in the event the positions of Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer are held by the same individual. This “Independent Lead Director Charter” was developed\nto describe the responsibilities of the Independent Lead Director if the same individual is Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer. This charter states that the Independent Lead Director will be a member of the Board who\nsatisfies the requirements for independent directors under the Nasdaq rules. Mr. Juster is our current Independent\nLead Director.\nAs described in the charter, the Independent Lead Director has responsibility for, among other things:\n• consulting with the Chief Executive Officer for Board schedules and agendas, including advising the\nChief Executive Officer as to the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the information submitted by\nMerchants’ management;\n• organizing meetings of the independent directors as necessary to, in part, ensure they have adequate\nresources for decision making and to serve as the principal liaison between the independent directors\nand the Chief Executive Officer;\n• conducting exit interviews with all departing executive officers, as appropriate; and\n• handling other such matters that are specifically delegated to the Independent Lead Director by the\nBoard from time to time.\nBoard’s Role in Risk Management\nRisk is inherent in any business; as is the case with other management functions, our senior management\nhas the primary responsibility for managing the risks we face. However, as a financial institution, our business\ninvolves financial risks that do not exist, or that are more extensive than the risks that exist, in some other types of\nbusinesses. We are subject to extensive regulation that requires us to assess and manage those risks, and our\nregulators assess our performance in that regard during their examinations. As a result, the Board is actively\ninvolved in overseeing our risk management programs.\nWhile the full Board is charged with ultimate oversight responsibility for risk management, various\ncommittees of the Board and members of management also have responsibilities with respect to our risk oversight.\nIn particular, the Audit Committee oversees and assesses our financial risk and the Risk Committee monitors our\ncredit, operational, and compliance risks, including our enterprise risk management program, and each receives\nregular reports from senior management regarding comprehensive risk as well as particular areas of concern. The\nCompensation Committee monitors and assesses the various risks associated with compensation policies and\noversees incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking consistent with our overall strategy.\nFurther, our Chairman meets regularly with senior management to discuss strategy and the risks we face.\nSenior management attends Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the\nBoard on risk management and any other matters.\nBoard Committees\nEach of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are comprised\nsolely of directors that meet the definition of “independent director” under the Nasdaq rules, and as to the Audit\nCommittee, also satisfy the requirements of SEC Rule 10A-3. All members of the Risk Committee are independent\ndirectors with the exception of Mr. Dinwiddie. Each committee meets at such times as determined to be necessary.\nEach committee has a written charter which sets forth the committee’s duties and responsibilities and is\nreviewed by that committee on a regular basis. The current charters of the committees are available on our website\n(investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under the corporate profile – governance documents section.\n5\nThe following table identifies the committee members.\nNominating and\nCorporate\nDirector Audit Compensation Governance Risk\nTamika D.

In addition, the Board has determined that each of\nMr. Juster, Ms. Sellers, and Mr. Shane qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” as that term is defined under\nthe applicable SEC rules.\nAs described in its charter, the Audit Committee has responsibility for, among other things:\n• selecting and reviewing the performance of our independent auditors and approving, in advance, all\nengagements and fee arrangements;\n• reviewing the independence of our independent auditors;\n• reviewing actions by management on recommendations of the independent auditors and internal\nauditors, including reviewing and approving the internal audit plan and budget on an annual basis;\n• meeting with management, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors to review the\neffectiveness of our system of internal control and internal audit procedures and results;\n• reviewing earnings releases, financial statements, and reports to be filed with the SEC or otherwise;\n• reviewing and approving transactions for potential conflicts of interest under our Code of Conduct; and\n• handling other such matters that are specifically delegated to the Audit Committee by the Board from\ntime to time.\nCompensation Committee\nAs described in its charter, the Compensation Committee has responsibility for, among other things:\n• overseeing executive compensation and management succession plans; personnel policies, benefits\nprograms, and incentive compensation as they relate to our executive officers; and ensuring the\ncompetitiveness thereof;\n• establishing performance goals and objectives relative to the compensation of our executive officers;\n• determining the annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer;\n• recommending to the Board the compensation of all other executive officers, including annual base\nsalary, annual or short-term incentive opportunities, long-term incentive opportunities, employment,\nseverance, and/or change-in-control agreements, and any perquisites or special benefits;\n• reviewing the talent development and executive succession planning process with our Chief Executive\nOfficer;\n• preparing the Compensation Committee report that may be required by SEC rules to be included in our\n6\nannual reports and proxy statements; and\n• handling such other matters that are specifically delegated to the Compensation Committee by the\nBoard from time to time.\nWhile the Compensation Committee maintains the authority to engage any compensation consultant at any\ntime as it deems necessary or appropriate, it generally has not engaged outside compensation consultants in\ndetermining or recommending the amount or form of executive officer or director compensation. Instead, the\nCompensation Committee has primarily relied on publicly available data and internal resources, such as our human\nresources department. However, as discussed further in the Compensation and Discussion Analysis section below, in\nJune 2022, the Compensation Committee engaged Aon’s Human Capital Solutions practice, a division of Aon plc\n(“Aon”), as its independent compensation consultant and to conduct a review of our executive compensation\namounts and structure, and advise our Compensation Committee on its decisions and recommendations for 2023.\nDuring 2023, Aon provided services related to director compensation (as discussed in Director Compensation\nbelow) but did not provide any services with respect to executive compensation.\nExecutive officers may participate in discussions with the Compensation Committee regarding our\ncompensation practices. The Compensation Committee regularly requests recommendations from and then has\ndiscussions with Messrs. Petrie and Dunlap, regarding other executive officers’ compensation. However, no\nexecutive officer is present during the Compensation Committee’s vote on such executive officer’s compensation.\nAdditionally, on an annual basis, the Compensation Committee reviews the material incentive compensation plans\nfor non-executive employees to help ensure that the proper behavior is being encouraged and payouts align with our\nactual financial results.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nAs described in its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has responsibility for,\namong other things:\n• recommending persons to be selected by the Board as nominees for election as directors or to fill any\nvacancies on the Board;\n• monitoring the functioning of our standing committees and recommending any changes, including the\ncreation or elimination of any committee;\n• reviewing and assessing the standard for determining director independence consistent with the\nrequirements of applicable laws, regulations, and the Nasdaq rules;\n• annually assessing the independence of directors and recommending action to the Board to effect\nchanges in incumbent directors (if deemed appropriate by the Committee);\n• recommending to the Board on an annual basis an independent director to serve as Chairman or Lead\nIndependent Director, as applicable;\n• reviewing shareholder proposals properly submitted, including any proposed amendments to our\nArticles or By-Laws; and\n• generally advising the Board on corporate governance matters, including reviewing and assessing the\nCompany’s compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, including state and\nfederal banking laws and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Nasdaq rules.\nAdditionally, as provided for in its charter, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has\nthe power and authority to conduct certain activities as it deems appropriate, including:\n• advising and making recommendations to the Board on the appropriate size and composition of the\nBoard; and\n• making recommendations to the Board with respect to the qualifications and independence of members\nof the Board, committee member qualifications, and committee structure and operations.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not currently have any specific minimum\nrequirements for a nominee recommended by it. Additionally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee does not currently have a policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director\n7\nnominees. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee works diligently to ensure that it has\nidentified and recommended nominees that will provide appropriate oversight and bring a variety of perspectives,\nwhether from personal or business experiences.\nRisk Committee\nAs described in its charter, the Risk Committee has responsibility for, among other things:\n• establishing the strategy, policy-setting, centralized oversight, communication, and reporting to\nmanagement and the Board regarding our Enterprise Risk Management Program;\n• exercising oversight and monitoring of major risk types (i.e., strategic, credit, operational, fraud,\ncompliance, reputational, interest rate, and market risks) against established key risk indicators and risk\ntolerances to monitor the direction and potential trends, including risk mitigation efforts;\n• reviewing management’s risk management framework and associated procedures for effective\nidentification and oversight of the major risk types;\n• making periodic reports to the Board and coordinating with other Board-level and management-level\ncommittees, as appropriate, concerning risk management issues within the other committees’\nrespective areas of responsibility; and\n• reviewing results of examinations by regulatory agencies, including any significant observations or\ncommunications by regulatory agencies, and reviewing and monitoring management’s response to\naddress reported issues.\nShareholder Communication with the Board, Nomination, and Proposal Procedures\nGeneral Communications with the Board.

Shane 65,000 50,093 115,093\n(1) For 2023, our directors were eligible to receive up to four (4) installments of a number of shares of our common\nstock equal $12,500, with each installment to be paid immediately following each of our regularly scheduled board\nmeetings in February, May, August, and November, so long as they were serving on the Board as of the date of such\nmeeting. The number of shares for each installment was based on the closing price of our common stock on the day\nimmediately prior to the issuance of such shares, rounded up to the next whole share. The February installment was\nbased on a closing price of $30.63 on February 15, 2023, the May installment was based on a closing price of $23.80\non May 17, 2023, the August installment was based on the closing price of $30.10 on August 16, 2023, and\nNovember installment was based on the closing price of $32.28 on November 14, 2023.\nDirectors’ Fees\nUnder the Compensation Committee’s charter, the Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing\nand making recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of Non-Executive Directors. For 2023, our\nNon-Executive Directors were compensated consistent with our 2021 Director Compensation Structure described\nbelow. Each of our directors also serves as director of our wholly owned subsidiary, Merchants Bank of Indiana\n(“Merchants Bank”).\nIn late 2020, our Chairman recommended to the Compensation Committee that there be a review of the\noverall compensation, including total amount and structure, for Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman’s\nrecommendation was based on a variety of factors, including that the most recent review of director compensation\nwas in early 2018, shortly after our 2017 initial public offering, that it is in the best interest of our shareholders to\nensure that that we are able to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on the Board, and that Non-Executive\nDirector compensation be commensurate with the level of responsibility and expectations placed on the Board.\nFollowing the Chairman’s recommendation, the Compensation Committee conducted a thorough review of\nNon-Executive Director compensation. The Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation structure for the\nboards of directors of the same peer group as used by the Compensation Committee at that time to review executive\ncompensation and the compensation structure for the boards of directors of other publicly traded companies based in\nthe Indianapolis area. Although the other publicly traded companies based in the Indianapolis area may not\nnecessarily compete with us for financial services, they may compete with us for the services of individuals to serve\non their boards of directors. Additionally, the Compensation Committee discussed our strategic objectives, growth,\nand other relevant circumstances with Mr. Petrie, Mr. Dunlap, and our General Counsel, Terry A. Oznick.\nIn early 2021, the Compensation Committee completed its review and recommended to the Board certain\nchanges to our Non-Executive Director compensation. The Board then considered and ultimately adopted those\nrecommendations and the changes to became effective immediately following the Company’s 2021 annual meeting\nof shareholders. This “2021 Director Compensation Structure” provides for Non-Executive Directors to receive:\n• $100,000 annual retainer, comprised of $50,000 in cash and a number of shares of restricted common\nstock equal to $50,000, to be paid in equal quarterly installments (with each installment of common\nstock rounded up to the nearest whole share) so long as the Non-Executive Director remains on the\nBoard at the time of payment;\n• $15,000, $10,000, $7,500, and $15,000 annual cash retainer for the Chairpersons of the Audit,\nCompensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Risk Committees, respectively, to be\nprorated if changes in committee leadership are made mid-year; and\n10\n• No additional compensation for service as a director of Merchants Bank or any of our other\nsubsidiaries or for attendance at any meeting.\nWe did not make any changes in the 2021 Director Compensation Structure from the time it was\nimplemented, through 2023.\nHowever, in 2023 the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to conduct a thorough\nreview of our Non-Executive Director compensation with the assistance of our compensation consultant, Aon. The\nCompensation Committee determined that, similar to that of our executive officers, in recent years the expectations\nand responsibilities of our Non-Executive Directors had increased, especially considering the Company’s growth in\nassets and increased complexity.\nThe Compensation Committee engaged Aon, who in August 2023 provided certain reports regarding the\ncompensation of the board of directors of our current peer group (provided below in Executive Compensation). The\nCompensation Committee believed that this peer group was appropriate for reviewing director compensation as well\nas executive compensation because directors in the peer group are more likely to be responsible for overseeing\norganizations that engage in similar business activities, have portions of their business activities that are more\ncomplex than traditional bank holding companies, and are subject to a similar level of regulatory scrutiny. Among\nother information provided in its reports, Aon provided details on the total amounts and cash and equity proportions\nof retainers for directors generally, as well as committee chairs and lead independent directors, where applicable.\nThese reports provided that in we were in the bottom tenth percentile in our peer group in each of total\ncompensation and the amounts of cash and equity paid to directors.\nThe Compensation Committee also reviewed the compensation structure for the boards of directors of other\npublicly traded companies based in the Indianapolis area, which, as noted above, may not necessarily compete with\nus for financial services but may compete with us for the services of individuals to serve on their boards of directors.\nOur directors’ total compensation ranked among the bottom of Indianapolis based publicly traded companies.\nAdditionally, the Compensation Committee discussed our strategic objectives, growth, and other relevant\ncircumstances with Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, and Oznick.\nUpon the completion of its review in November 2023, the Compensation Committee believed it was\nappropriate to make changes to the director compensation structure and recommended the below “2024 Director\nCompensation Structure” to the Board.\n• Compensation for service on the Board will only be paid to Non-Executive Directors.\n• No additional compensation for service as a director of Merchants Bank or any of our other\nsubsidiaries or for attendance at any meeting.\n• A $140,000 annual retainer, comprised of $70,000 in cash and a number of shares of restricted\ncommon stock equal to $70,000, to be paid in equal quarterly installments (with each installment of\ncommon stock rounded up to the nearest whole share) so long as the Non-Executive Director remains\non the Board at the time of payment.\n• $17,500 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Audit Committee.\n• $17,500 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Risk Committee.\n• $12,500 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Compensation Committee.\n• $10,000 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee.\n• If the Company’s positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person and the\nBoard has elected a Lead Independent Director, $15,000 annual cash retainer for the Lead Independent\nDirector.\n• Committee Chair and Lead Independent Director retainers will be prorated if there is any change in\nsuch position between annual meetings of shareholders.\nThe Board reviewed the Compensation Committee’s recommendation and approved the 2024 Director\nCompensation Structure in November 2023 and it became effective in January 2024.\n11\nPROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nAt the Annual Meeting, shareholders entitled to vote will elect eleven (11) directors to serve until our 2025\nannual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her\nearlier resignation, removal, or death.

Petrie, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer;\n• Michael J. Dunlap, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and President and Chief\nExecutive Officer of Merchants Bank;\n• Michael R. Dury, President and Chief Executive Officer of Merchants Capital;\n16\n• John F. Macke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and\n• Martin A. Schroeter, President – Warehouse Lending.\nRegulatory Impact on Compensation\nAs a publicly traded financial institution, we are subject to various regulations when considering and\nimplementing compensation-related decisions. Although these regulations do not set specific parameters within\nwhich compensation decisions must be made, they do require that we be mindful of the risks associated with\ncompensation programs designed to incentivize the achievement of better than average performance.\nIn particular, the federal bank regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”),\nhave long held that excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice. In describing a\nframework to determine whether compensation is excessive, the FDIC has indicated that financial institutions should\nconsider whether aggregate cash amounts paid, or noncash benefits provided, to employees are unreasonable or\ndisproportionate to the services performed by an employee. The FDIC encourages financial institutions to review an\nemployee’s compensation history and to consider internal pay equity, and, as appropriate, to consider benchmarking\ncompensation to peer groups. Finally, the FDIC provides that, in order to give proper context, such an assessment\nmust be made in light of the institution’s overall financial condition.\nAdditionally, we must also take into account the joint agency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation\nPolicies, which sets forth a framework for assessing and mitigating risk associated with incentive compensation\nplans, programs, and arrangements maintained by financial institutions.\nOther matters, such as accounting, tax, and SEC requirements regarding risk assessment are also considered\nby the Compensation Committee and Board as part of its compensation design and annual decisions.\nThe SEC adopted final “clawback” rules in October 2022, as directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, which\nNasdaq implemented in 2023. In November 2023, we revised our clawback policy and it, among other things,\nrequires that we recover excess incentive-based compensation from executive officers if we are required to prepare\nan accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under securities\nlaws. A copy of our clawback policy can be found on our website (investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under the\ncorporate profile – governance documents section.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nWhile we are headquartered in and most of our executive officers are located in Indiana, we compete and\nmeasure our performance on both local and national levels. We strive to be among the top performing banks in the\nnation. Our compensation philosophy reflects this strategy and expectation. In establishing our executive\ncompensation program, the Compensation Committee considers the practices of our peers, but does not set\ncompensation at a specific percentile of our peers. Instead, the Compensation Committee views peer data as one tool\navailable to them for consideration, along with market conditions and the executive officer’s current and future\nresponsibilities, among other factors.\nWe structure our executive compensation program to align with our overall expectations and to motivate\nour NEOs to drive actual results, but at the same time not encourage excessive risk taking behaviors. In particular:\nWhat We Do What We Do Not Do\n• Consider peer group information in • Provide for single-trigger payments\ncompensation decisions upon change in control\n• Only provide for double-trigger severance • Reprice equity awards\npayments upon a change in control\n• Vest equity awards ratably over multiple years • Provide tax gross-ups\n• Tie equity awards to overall Company • Guarantee cash awards – incentive\nperformance using measures that are compensation may be reduced to zero if\nimportant to shareholders (e.g., revenue, threshold performance measures are not\nreturn on equity, and earnings per share) met\n17\nPrior Year’s Say-on-Pay Vote\nAt our 2023 annual meeting, our shareholders had the opportunity to provide a non-binding, advisory vote\non the compensation paid to our NEOs, or a “say-on-pay” vote, for the first time. Over 84 percent of the votes cast\nby our shareholders were in favor of the compensation provided to our NEOs. This result affirmed majority\nshareholder support of our approach to executive compensation, and informed the Compensation Committee’s\ndiscussions during the year, which resulted in no significant changes.\nAdditionally, at our 2023 annual meeting, our shareholders had the opportunity to provide a non-binding,\nadvisory vote on the frequency of our say-on-pay vote, for the first time. Over 98% of the votes cast by our\nshareholders were in favor of having a say-on-pay vote every year. In recognition of that vote, a non-binding,\nadvisory say-on-pay vote will occur at the Annual Meeting so that any shareholder concerns about executive pay can\nbe acknowledged and considered in a timely manner.\nThe Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from this year’s say-on-pay advisory\nvote and future advisory votes on executive compensation and any related feedback received from our shareholders\nvia other channels when making its compensation decisions.\nGeneral Discussion of Board, Compensation Committee, and Executive Roles in Compensation Decisions\nThe Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility for evaluating the compensation plans and\npractices for all of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and determines the\ncompensation of our Chief Executive Officer and makes a recommendation to the Board for the compensation of our\nother NEOs.\nThe Compensation Committee generally completes its annual review in January following the fiscal year-\nend and meets in that same month to determine the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and make\nrecommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of our other NEOs for the upcoming fiscal year, in each\ncase including both the specific components and amounts of such compensation. In determining the Chief Executive\nOfficer’s compensation and making recommendations to the Board regarding the other NEOs’ compensation, the\nCompensation Committee members meet with members of senior management and review materials prepared by\nboth the Company and third parties to, among other reasons, ensure that the Compensation Committee understands\nthe NEO’s current role and future plans the Company may have for such NEO and the broader market for such\nNEO’s services. Additionally, the Compensation Committee solicits input from Mr. Petrie and Mr. Dunlap,\nincluding their assessment of each NEO’s performance and contributions to the Company’s strategic objectives.\nHowever, no NEO is present during the Compensation Committee’s deliberation or vote to approve any\nrecommendation to the Board regarding any NEOs’ compensation.\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the target performance measures for all cash\nincentive awards and equity incentive awards and the payout ranges therefor for all NEOs. The Compensation\nCommittee believes that including payout ranges is more in line with market practice and provides proper incentive\nfor outstanding performance, without encouraging overly risky behavior. Additionally, for the equity incentive\nawards, the Compensation Committee generally uses the closing share price of the Company’s common stock on\nDecember 31st of the prior fiscal year (or other date that is the last trading day of that year) for determining the\namount of the payout. The Compensation Committee believes that using such date takes into account the Company’s\nperformance through the fiscal year and more closely aligns the NEOs’ awards to the shareholders’ return.\nCompensation Consultants\nThe Compensation Committee’s charter gives it the authority to hire consultants to further its objectives\nand responsibilities. Historically, the Compensation Committee’s practice has been to not hire any consultants. This\nis largely because in the Board’s experience it has been difficult for consultants and similar third parties to fully\nunderstand our business model, which is unlike most traditional banks, or find appropriate peer institutions or find\nother executive officers whose roles align with those of our executive officers. Instead, the Compensation\nCommittee has generally relied upon market data provided by internal parties that the Compensation Committee\ndeems reasonable and appropriate, including our internal human resources department, and survey data from\nindustry resources. However, in January 2022, the Compensation Committee determined that it would be\nappropriate and helpful to the Compensation Committee to hire a consultant to review current compensation\npractices and levels and make recommendations for 2023.\nAfter issuing a request for proposal and considering bids for services from several compensation\n18\nconsultants, in June 2022 the Compensation Committee hired Aon as its independent compensation consultant. The\nCompensation Committee believed that Aon had the best grasp of our business and the mortgage banking business\ngenerally, had the best data available, and would be best equipped to review our current practices and make\nrecommendations that would be useful both immediately and long-term. In its engagement of Aon, the\nCompensation Committee considered the independence of its compensation advisors under applicable SEC and\nNasdaq listing rules and concluded there was no conflict of interest with respect to this engagement.\nAon’s specific services to the Compensation Committee included support in the Compensation\nCommittee’s effort to review our then existing peer group and develop a new peer group, if appropriate, review\npotential risks associated with our compensation programs, and analyze our executive officer compensation levels,\nincluding based on the new peer group, if one was determined to be appropriate. As part of its services, the\nCompensation Committee expected Aon to provide information that would be useful for the Compensation\nCommittee in evaluating potential changes to executive compensation for 2023, including overall compensation\namounts and compensation structures.\nDuring this review process the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to develop a\nnew peer group. In particular, the Compensation Committee noted that in recent years we have grown significantly\nmore than most of the members of that 2022 peer group, including in asset size, net income, and the complexity of\nour business model.\nIn developing an appropriate new peer group, the Compensation Committee believed it was important that\nour unique characteristics be considered. In particular, that we have a limited physical branch network but operate\nnational businesses and that we primarily offer mortgage and real estate centric products, with a particular focus on\nmultifamily mortgage banking. With Aon’s assistance, we primarily considered institutions:\n• with annual revenues between $300 million and $860 million (as of June 30, 2022);\n• with multifamily loans being more than 7% of their total loan portfolio; and/or\n• which are otherwise close competitors in geography or business model.\nIn September 2022, the Compensation Committee selected the following group of 26 publicly traded\ncompanies as its new peer group:\nBanc of California Inc. First Busey Corp.* Pacific Premier Bancorp\nBanner Corp. First Financial Bancorp Provident Financial Services\nBerkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. First Foundation Inc.* QCR Holdings Inc.\nBrookline Bancorp Inc. First Merchants Corp.* S&T Bancorp Inc.\nCustomers Bancorp Inc.* HomeStreet Inc.* The Bancorp\nCVB Financial Corp. Independent Bank Corp. TriCo Bancshares\nDime Community Bancshares Inc.* Lakeland Financial Corp.* Walker & Dunlop Inc.\nEagle Bancorp Inc NBT Bancorp Inc. Washington Federal Inc.\nEastern Bankshares Inc. OceanFirst Financial Corp.\n*denotes company that was also in our peer group in 2022.\nAfter developing this new peer group, Aon provided the Compensation Committee with certain reports\ndetailing how our executive compensation practices compared, including in total amounts of compensation, mix of\ncash and equity, and overall compensation structure. While we do not set compensation to a specific percentile of\nour peers, the Compensation Committee believed it was noteworthy that several of our NEOs were among the\nbottom tenth percentile in total compensation.\nIn December 2022, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed these reports with Aon\nrepresentatives and discussed our historical and future performance and strategic objectives with our management,\nincluding Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, and Oznick. In January 2023, the Compensation Committee established our Chief\nExecutive Officer’s 2023 compensation and made its recommendation to the Board regarding the other NEOs’ 2023\ncompensation. The Board approved such recommendations in January 2023.\n19\nCompensation Components\nWe compensate our NEOs through a combination of base salary, cash bonus awards, cash incentive\nawards, equity incentive awards, and other benefits. Our compensation packages for our NEOs focus on rewarding\nperformance as measured against established corporate goals. Additionally, in the case of Messrs. Dury and\nSchroeter we provide compensation for the performance of the lines of business they manage, Merchants Capital\nand mortgage warehouse, respectively. Each element of our NEOs’ compensation is designed to achieve a specific\npurpose and to contribute to a total package that is competitive with similar packages provided by other institutions\nthat compete for the services of individuals like our NEOs. The Compensation Committee also believes that awards\n(including commissions, in the case of Mr. Dury) that relate to the performance of the Company and/or the NEO’s\nline of business should be an equal or greater percentage than salary of a NEO’s total compensation to ensure that\nsuch NEO has appropriate levels of compensation at risk if results are not achieved and is therefore properly\nmotivated and aligned with shareholders.\nFor 2023, the Compensation Committee ultimately established, in the case of Mr. Petrie, and recommended\nto the Board, in the case of our other NEOs, the following salaries and target cash and equity incentives:\nTarget Target\nName Salary\nCash Incentive (1) Equity Incentive (2)\nMichael F. Petrie $900,000 $900,000 $900,000\nMichael J. Dunlap $800,000 $800,000 $800,000\nMichael R. Dury $300,000 - $210,000\nJohn F. Macke $400,000 $200,000 $200,000\nMartin A. Schroeter $400,000 $200,000 $200,000\n(1) This table does not include any commissions or discretionary bonuses a NEO may be eligible for which are discussed\nbelow in this CD&A.\n(2) Mr. Schroeter’s equity incentive was ultimately replaced with a discretionary cash award further described in this\nCD&A.\nThe Compensation Committee established total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average\ntotal equity as the performance measures for all cash incentive awards and equity incentive awards for each NEO.\nThe Compensation Committee established a target for each of the performance measures based on a Board approved\nbudget for 2023. Each performance measure was equally weighted, and the incentives had a payout range of 75% to\n125% of target. The Compensation Committee believes that these performance measures are meaningful and the\ntargets are challenging without encouraging excessive risk and help ensure that NEOs’ incentives are aligned with\nthe benefits and return received by shareholders.\nAfter reviewing the Compensation Committee’s recommendations, the Board approved of such\nrecommendations. However, after the conclusion of our 2023 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee\nrecommended changes to Mr. Schroeter’s compensation structure, replacing his equity incentive award with a\ndiscretionary cash award that more closely aligned his compensation to the success of our mortgage warehouse\nbusiness. The Compensation Committee believed this was appropriate considering the success of the mortgage\nwarehouse business in 2023 notwithstanding the challenging market conditions for single family mortgages caused\nby interest rates that continued to rapidly rise in 2023, among other factors. In particular, our mortgage warehouse\nsegment had net income of $73.5 million in 2023 as compared to $48.6 million in 2022, despite a decrease in single\nfamily mortgage volume across the industry of approximately 30 percent.\nBase Salary\nBase salary is the only component of compensation that is not subject to the achievement of performance or\nvesting criteria. Base salary is designed to provide a fixed level of cash compensation for performing the\nresponsibilities associated with an executive’s position. We review base salaries annually and adjust them effective\nas of January 1st of each year to take into account such factors as market changes, changes in duties, individual\nperformance, and experience.\nAs described above, after consulting with Aon and reviewing data related to our new peer group, the\nCompensation Committee determined that the total compensation of our NEOs was well below market. Considering\nthis information and each NEOs role at the company, the Compensation Committee believe it was appropriate to\n20\nincrease our NEOs’ salaries. The following table provides the salary increases for our NEOs from 2022 to 2023.\n2022 2023 Percentage\nName\nSalary Salary Increase\nMichael F. Petrie $850,000 $900,000 5.9%\nMichael J. Dunlap $650,000 $800,000 23.1%\nMichael R. Dury $260,000 $300,000 15.4%\nJohn F. Macke $325,000 $400,000 23.1%\nMartin A. Schroeter $300,000 $400,000 33.3%\nCash Bonus and Cash Incentive Awards\nIf a cash incentive award is established for a NEO, it is generally tied to our achievement of certain\nperformance measures established by the Compensation Committee for that fiscal year and generally not tied to\nindividual goals. Further, the performance measures established generally must be consistent with those permitted\nunder our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”) and the Compensation Committee is responsible for\ndetermining the level of achievement of those performance measures. For 2023, the Committee established total\nrevenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total equity as the performance measures for the cash\nincentive award.\nIf a cash incentive award is established for a NEO, in addition to establishing the relevant performance\nmeasures, the Compensation Committee establishes a target and weight for each performance measure and payout\npercentage for above target performance. Additionally, all cash incentives are conditioned upon Merchants Bank\nbeing well capitalized under applicable FDIC regulations at the end of each quarter of that calendar year.\nAs provided above in this CD&A, for 2023 cash incentive awards, the Compensation Committee\nestablished:\n• Performance Measures: total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total\nequity.\n• Weighting: equal weighting to each performance measure.\n• Payout Percentages: between 75% to 125% of target; provided, however, payouts could be\nreduced to zero percent if threshold performance measures were not met and/or Merchants Bank\nfailed to be well capitalized for any quarter in 2023.\nFor 2023, Mr. Dury did not have an established target cash incentive award. The Compensation Committee\nand Board believed that his compensation was appropriately structured in other ways to ensure that he was properly\nmotivated and aligned with shareholder interest. In particular, he was compensated with commissions on fees the\nCompany received on certain loans he was responsible for closing and also with a volume bonus based on the\noverall business generated by Merchants Capital (as further described in Executive Compensation - Employment\nAgreements below). Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Macke, and Schroeter each had a target cash incentive award\nestablished in 2023.\nAt each fiscal year-end, the Compensation Committee reviews our overall performance as compared to the\nestablished targets for the performance measures, reviews whether Merchants Bank maintained well capitalized\nstatus for each quarter, and determines whether the NEO is entitled to receive a payout of such cash incentive. For\n2023, if the 75% of target threshold for a performance measure was not met, none of Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Macke,\nand Schroeter would receive a payout with respect to the portion of their cash incentive award associated with that\nperformance measure. Also, Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Macke, and Schroeter would not receive a payout if Merchants\nBank was not well capitalized at the end of any quarter in 2023.\nIn January 2024, the Compensation Committee completed its review and determined we achieved the\nfollowing results and that Merchants Bank maintained well capitalized status for each quarter of 2023 and approved\nthe following payouts for cash incentive awards.\n21\nActual Percentage\nPerformance Measure Target\nResults of Target\nTotal Revenue $508,397,000 $522,508,000 103%\nEarnings Per Common Share $5.17 $5.64 109%\nReturn on Average Total Equity 16.56% 17.63% 106%\nPayout Percentage 106%\nIn addition to the target cash incentive award described above, the Compensation Committee and the Board\nhave authorized Mr. Petrie and Mr. Dunlap to make a discretionary cash bonus award to any NEOs (other than to\nthemselves or, in the case of Mr. Dunlap, to Mr. Petrie) based on exceptional individual performance (e.g.,\nperformance of business unit well beyond budget). The amount of any such cash bonus may not exceed 10% of such\nexecutive’s target total compensation, or in the case of Mr. Dunlap and Mr. Dury may not exceed $200,000, without\nthe Board’s prior approval. Mr. Petrie or Mr. Dunlap must provide the details of any such cash bonus to the\nCompensation Committee promptly after the award.\nFor 2023, neither Mr. Petrie nor Mr. Dunlap awarded any discretionary cash bonuses to any NEO.\nHowever, as provided above, the Compensation Committee recommended, and Board approved of replacing Mr.\nSchroeter’s target equity incentive with a discretionary cash bonus award. Mr. Schroeter was awarded a\ndiscretionary cash bonus of $588,000 related to the performance of our mortgage warehouse business.\nIn addition to the cash incentives and cash bonuses described above, each of our NEOs are eligible to\nreceive certain nominal cash incentive awards to the same extent as all other employees, such as for completing\ncertain training. For 2023, each NEO each received $100 in such nominal cash incentives.\nEquity Awards\nUnder our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”), we have the ability to award a variety of instruments,\nbut to date have only issued restricted stock units, with each restricted stock unit subject to vesting requirements\nestablished by the Compensation Committee. We believe that other instruments, such as options, create unnecessary\ncomplexity and do not align with the best interest of our shareholders. Additionally, we do not pay dividends or any\nother form of compensation on restricted stock units prior to vesting.\nIf an equity incentive award is established for a NEO, it is tied to our achievement of certain performance\nmeasures established by the Compensation Committee for that fiscal year. Further, the performance measures\nestablished must be consistent with those permitted under the 2017 Plan and the Compensation Committee is\nresponsible for determining the level of achievement of those performance measures.\nMessrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Dury, Macke, and Schroeter were eligible to receive an equity incentive award\nunder the 2017 Plan and had an established target award in 2023. However, as provided above, Mr. Schroeter’s\nequity incentive award was ultimately replaced with a discretionary cash bonus award. The Compensation\nCommittee established total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total equity as the\nperformance measures for all equity incentive awards in 2023.\nIn the same manner as for our cash incentives, as provided above in this CD&A, for 2023 equity awards the\nCompensation Committee established:\n• Performance Measures: total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total\nequity.\n• Weighting: equal weighting to each performance measure.\n• Payout Percentages: between 75% to 125% of target; provided, however, payouts could be\nreduced to zero percent if threshold performance measures were not met and/or Merchants Bank\nfailed to be well capitalized for any quarter in 2023.\nAlso in the same manner as for our cash incentives, after our fiscal year-end the Compensation Committee\nreviews our overall performance as compared to the established performance measures, reviews whether Merchants\nBank maintained well capitalized status for each quarter, and determines whether the NEO is entitled to receive a\npayout of such cash incentive. For 2023, if the 75% of target threshold for a performance measure was not met, no\n22\nNEO would receive a payout with respect to the portion of their equity incentive award associated with that\nperformance measure. Also, no NEO would receive a payout if Merchants Bank was not well capitalized at the end\nof any quarter in 2023.\nAs provided above in this CD&A, at its January 2024 meeting, the Compensation Committee determined\nthat for 2023 we achieved an average of 106% of the target performance measures, and Merchants Bank was well\ncapitalized at the end of each quarter, and therefore each of Messers. Petrie, Dunlap, Dury, and Macke received a\npayout of 106% of their respective target equity incentive award in the form of restricted stock units, rounded up to\nthe nearest whole share. Each award vests ratably over a three (3) year period, with the first portion vesting on the\nFebruary 1st after the first anniversary date of the award (i.e., for 2023 equity incentive awards, the first portion will\nvest on February 1, 2025). The Compensation Committee believes the vesting period for equity incentive awards is a\nvaluable retention tool for the services of our NEOs.\nMr. Schroeter did not receive any equity incentive compensation in 2023. The Compensation Committee\nand Board determined his compensation was appropriately structured in other ways to ensure that he was properly\nmotivated and aligned with shareholder interest. In particular, that his compensation should be primarily tied to the\nperformance of our mortgage warehouse business.\nBenefits and Other Perquisites\nOur NEOs are eligible to participate in the same benefit plans designed for all of our employees, including\nhealth, dental, vision, disability, and basic group life insurance coverage. We also provide our employees, including\nour NEOs, with various retirement benefits. Our retirement plans are designed to assist our employees in planning\nfor retirement and securing appropriate levels of income during retirement. The purpose of our retirement plans is to\nattract and retain quality employees, including executives, by offering benefit plans similar to those typically offered\nby our competitors. We generally do not provide perquisites to our NEOs with the exception of country club\nmembership dues for Mr. Petrie. These plans and perquisites are described in Executive Compensation — Benefits\nbelow.\nStock Ownership and Hedging\nWe do not currently require our directors or executive officers to maintain any particular level of ownership\nof any of our securities. However, our directors receive a portion of their retainer in the form of our common stock\nand our NEOs are each eligible to receive and/or have received in prior years, awards of restricted stock units as part\nof their compensation. Additionally, we do not currently have any prohibition on our directors, executive officers, or\nemployees hedging or pledging any securities they may own. However, all of our directors, executive officers, and\nemployees are subject to our Code of Conduct and insider trading policies and directors and executive officers in\nparticular are required to seek the approval of our General Counsel prior to engaging in any transaction in our\nsecurities.\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\nWe have reviewed and discussed the CD&A with management. Based on our review and discussion with\nmanagement, we have recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this proxy statement and in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors\nof Merchants Bancorp\nPatrick D.

For 2023, we\nawarded restricted stock units in January 2024 after the Compensation Committee reviewed our full year performance.\nThe amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock awards for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.\n(3) Amounts represent certain nominal incentive awards and cash incentive awards to the NEO as described in the CD&A.\n(4) For Messrs.

For Mr. Petrie, the amount consisted of a contribution under our 401(k) Plan, an allocation\nunder our ESOP, and monthly country club dues and assessments. For 2023:\nESOP 401(k) Country Club Dues and\nName Allocation ($) Contribution ($) Assessments ($)\nMichael F. Petrie 4,000 9,900 17,537\nMichael J. Dunlap 4,000 9,900 -\nMichael R. Dury 4,000 9,900 -\nJohn F. Macke 4,000 9,900 -\nMartin A. Schroeter 4,000 9,900 -\nEmployment Agreements\nWe do not have employment agreements with any of our NEOs other than an “at will” employment\nagreement with Mr. Dury and change in control agreements described below. We believe that not having employee\nagreements provides us with more flexibility and adaptability when making annual compensation decisions.\nAs of January 1, 2021, we entered into that First Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (“2021\nEmployment Agreement”) with Mr. Dury. Under the 2021 Employment Agreement, Mr. Dury receives commission\ncompensation on origination fees received by us from a particular group of Merchants Capital’s customers. He does\n24\nnot receive commission related to any mortgage servicing rights or gain on sale. Mr. Dury also receives a volume\nbonus of 5% of Merchants Capital’s total fee income (the calculation of total fee income excludes any fees received\nrelated to customers for which Mr. Dury receives a commission).\nAs part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee reviews the 2021 Employment Agreement and\nmakes a recommendation to the Board as to whether it should remain in effect. For 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee recommended that the 2021 Employment Agreement remain in effect and the Board approved of such\nrecommendation. We believe the 2021 Employment Agreement, among other things, closely associates Mr. Dury’s\ncompensation to the overall success of Merchants Capital.\nUnder the 2021 Employment Agreement, Mr. Dury receives a base salary, which may be adjusted by Mr.\nDunlap as Chief Executive Officer of Merchants Bank, earns the 5% volume bonus, and earns the following\ncommissions:\nFees on Loans to Designated Borrowers\nOriginated by Mr. Dury Commissions Earned by Mr. Dury\nUnder an amount equal to 2x base salary None\n20% of the portion of the fees that exceeds 2x\nExceed 2x base salary but less than $750,000\nbase salary but does not exceed $750,000\n25% of the portion of the fees that exceeds\nExceeds $750,000 but less than $1,000,000\n$750,000 but does not exceed $1,000,000\n30% of the portion of the fees that exceeds\nExceeds $1,000,000\n$1,000,000\nThe loan fees on which Mr. Dury earns commissions are determined in our sole discretion and do not\ninclude fees paid prior to or after closing, or fees paid by any party other than the borrower.\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement includes certain restrictive covenants, including a 12-month non-\ncompetition and non-solicitation period.\nChange in Control Agreements\nIn January 2020, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board concluded that it\nwas in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, to take reasonable steps to compensate key executives,\nincluding our NEOs other than Mr. Petrie, in the event of a change in control event. With these agreements in place,\nif we should receive takeover or acquisition proposals from third parties, we will be able to call upon these key\nexecutives for their advice and assessment of whether such proposals are in the best interests of shareholders, free of\nthe influences of their personal employment situations. The Compensation Committee determined that it would not\nbe appropriate or in the best interest of shareholders to offer a change in control agreement to Mr. Petrie, in\nparticular because of the significant amount of our common stock Mr. Petrie beneficially owns.\nEach change in control agreement contains identical terms and, in particular: (a) provides for a severance\npayment of an amount equal to two times base salary plus two times the target cash incentive award most recently\napproved by the Board in the event both (1) there is a change in control event and (2) employment is terminated by\n(i) us for any reason other than cause or (ii) by the executive with good reason, within a period between 120 days\nprior to an announcement of the change in control event and 18 months after the change in control event becomes\neffective; (b) contains customary restrictive covenants regarding confidentiality; (c) contains a clawback provision\nshould any benefit thereunder be subject to recapture under any Company policy or applicable law; and (d)\nprohibits, for a 12-month period, (1) competing with us in any commercial banking, mortgage lending, or any\nsimilar lending or banking services provided by us anywhere in, or for any person whose principal office is located\nin, any county in which we maintain an office, after receipt of their severance payment and (2) soliciting our\ncustomers or employees, regardless of whether a severance payment is received. Severance payments will be made\nonly if the executive fully releases all claims against us.\nAs part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee reviews the change in control agreements and\nmakes a recommendation to the Board as to whether they should remain in effect. For 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee recommended that the change in control agreements remain in effect and the Board approved of such\nrecommendation.\n25\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nEquity-based incentive awards are currently made under the 2017 Plan. As provided in the CD&A,\nalthough the 2017 Plan permits us to issue various types of awards, to date we have only issued restricted stock\nawards under the 2017 Plan.\nMerchants Bancorp 2017 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe 2017 Plan was adopted by the Board on June 22, 2017 and approved by our shareholders on July 5,\n2017. The 2017 Plan was designed to ensure availability of equity awards that will assist us in attracting, retaining,\nand rewarding key employees, directors, and other service providers. Pursuant to the 2017 Plan, a committee of the\nBoard (the “Committee,” for which the Compensation Committee has been appointed by the Board to serve in such\nrole) is allowed to grant awards to eligible persons in the form of qualified and non-qualified stock options,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other incentive awards. Up to 2,250,000 shares\nof common stock are available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. To date, we have issued 268,874 shares of common\nstock under the 2017 Plan.\nAwards vest, become exercisable, and contain such other terms and conditions as determined by the\nCommittee and set forth in individual agreements with the participants receiving the awards. Awards to our Chief\nExecutive Officer must have a vesting period of at least three (3) years. The 2017 Plan enables the Committee to set\nspecific performance criteria, in compliance with the United States Treasury Department’s final “Guidance on\nSound Incentive Compensation Policies,” that must be met before an award vests under the 2017 Plan. In\nestablishing criteria, the Committee must attempt to balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not\nencourage participants to expose us to unnecessary or excess risks. At least 50% of any award to the Chief\nExecutive Officer must be performance-based. An award agreement with the Chief Executive Officer also must\nstipulate that the Chief Executive Officer will hold shares of stock received for at least a 12-month period after\nvesting requirements are satisfied, unless the Chief Executive Officer incurs a termination of service, in which case\nthe holding period ends on the termination date.\nThe 2017 Plan allows for acceleration of vesting and exercise privileges of grants if a change in control\noccurs and a participant incurs a termination of service without cause following the change in control. Our awards\ndo not currently provide for vesting upon death, disability, or retirement, although it would be permitted under the\n2017 Plan. If a participant’s employment is terminated for any reason, then all unvested awards expire at the date of\ntermination, unless otherwise approved by the Committee.\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards\nThe following table provides information on the incentive compensation and equity grants awarded to our\nNEOs in 2023.

Other than in connection with a change in control, our NEOs are not\nentitled to any payments if their employment is terminated for any reason, including for death, disability, or\nretirement.\nThe following table provides information on the potential payments and benefits our NEOs would be\nentitled to under our compensation programs and benefits plans, including the change in control agreements, upon a\nhypothetical termination of employment as of December 31, 2023. For the purposes of estimating the value of\naccelerated vesting of equity awards, we have assumed a per share price of $42.58 based on the closing price of our\ncommon stock on December 29, 2023.\n27\nTermination, by the Company Other\nthan for Cause, or by the Executive\nfor Good Reason, in Connection with\nName Type of Payment (1) Change in Control ($) (2)(3)\nCash Severance Payment -\nMichael F.

Schroeter\nOutstanding Equity Awards 621,668\n(1) For each NEO, the cash severance payment represents a payment under their change in control agreement and the\noutstanding equity award represents amounts that would automatically vest under the 2017 Plan.\n(2) These are gross amounts payable and are subject to a reduction if such amounts would exceed certain thresholds under\nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.\n(3) The amounts do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to\nsalaried employees generally upon termination of employment, or amounts that are fully vested under the terms of the\napplicable plan, such as accrued salary and vacation pay and distributions of plan balances under our 401(k) Plan and\nESOP.\nBenefits\n401(k) Plan. Our 401(k) Plan is designed to provide retirement benefits to all eligible full-time and part-\ntime employees (including those of our subsidiaries). The 401(k) Plan provides employees with the opportunity to\nsave for retirement on a tax-favored basis. NEOs, all of whom were eligible during 2023, may elect to participate in\nthe 401(k) Plan on the same basis as all other employees. Employees may defer between 1% and 100% of their\ncompensation to the 401(k) Plan, up to the applicable IRS limit. In 2023, for each employee we made a discretionary\ncontribution equal to 3% of an employee’s eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan each pay period regardless\nof whether such employee also contributes to the 401(k) Plan, up to the applicable IRS limit. Our contribution is in\nthe form of cash and is invested according to the employee’s current investment allocation.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan. In 2020, we established the Merchants Bancorp Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan (“ESOP”) in order to reward employees for their contributions towards our success and to help\nensure that our employees’ interests are more aligned with our shareholders. Under the ESOP, from time to time we\nmay make a contribution of newly issued shares of our common stock or cash to purchase shares of our common\nstock, which is then allocated to eligible employees. The ESOP contribution is completely funded by the Company,\nis in addition to all other wages, incentives, and benefits, and requires nothing from our employees other than their\nongoing hard work and dedication. An employee’s allocation in the ESOP vests ratably over a five (5) year service\nperiod with credit for service prior to the ESOP’s adoption. ESOP participants are entitled to vote and receive\ndividends on all shares allocated to them in the ESOP, including any portion of their respective allocation that has\nnot vested. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the ESOP to the same extent as all other employees. For 2023, we\nmade a contribution of newly issued shares of our common stock to the ESOP equal to 2% of all participants’\neligible wages. A participant’s eligible wages includes salary and commissions but excludes bonuses and other one-\ntime payments (e.g., sign-on bonus, cash bonus, cash incentive, and equity incentive awards), up to a maximum of\n$200,000. Each NEO received an allocation within the ESOP equal to $4,000 (as of December 31, 2023).\nHealth and Welfare Benefits. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our standard health and welfare\nbenefits program, which offers medical, dental, vision, life, accident, and disability coverage to all of our eligible\nemployees. We do not provide the NEOs with any health and welfare benefits that are not generally available to our\nother employees.\n28\nPerquisites. We pay monthly dues and assessments for country club memberships for Mr. Petrie, which he\nuses primarily to entertain current and prospective customers. We do not provide any other perquisites to our NEOs.\nTo date, we have not established any supplemental executive retirement plans or deferred compensation\nplans other than as described above.\nChief Executive Officer Pay Ratio\nIn the table below is a comparison of the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee\nand the annual total compensation of our CEO. In determining our median compensated employee, we used a roster\nof employees as of the close of business on December 29, 2023 (the last business day of 2023) and excluded our\nCEO. This roster included 621 employees.\nWe used base salary, commissions, cash bonuses, cash incentive awards, equity incentive awards, and\nemployer contributions to our 401(k) plan in determining total compensation. The amount of any benefit that is\ngenerally available to all employees and does not vary depending on an employee’s compensation, such as the value\nof health insurance benefits, was not included. This methodology is consistent with how we determined our CEO’s\ntotal compensation in the Summary Compensation Table above. Additionally, we annualized salaries for those\nemployees who were not employed for the full year of 2023, with the exception of temporary employees. No full-\ntime equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.\nMedian Employee Total Compensation $94,028\nCEO Total Annual Compensation $2,839,538\nRatio of CEO to Median Employee Compensation 30 to 1\nPay Versus Performance Table\nReturn\non\nValue of initial fixed $100 average\nAverage investment based on: Net income equity\nsummary Average\nSummary compensation compensation Peer group\nCompensation Compensation table total for actually paid Total total\ntable total for actually paid non-CEO to non-CEO shareholder shareholder\nYear CEO (1) to CEO NEOs (2) NEOs return return (3)\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i)\n2023 (4) $ 2,839,538 $ 4,982,645 $ 2,768,869 $ 3,191,500 $ 340 $ 109 $279,234,000 17.63%\n2022 (5) $ 1,908,889 $ 2,317,600 $ 3,038,319 $ 3,227,061 $ 192 $ 99 $219,721,000 17.21%\n2021 (6) $ 1,549,064 $ 2,159,020 $ 4,922,427 $ 5,895,969 $ 246 $ 120 $227,104,000 22.07%\n2020 (7) $1,578,683 $1,842,387 $2,984,136 $3,225,454 $ 143 $ 87 $180,533,000 25.09%\n(1) Our Chief Executive Officer for each of 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was Mr. Petrie.\n(2) Our Non-Chief Executive Officers for 2023 and 2022 were Messrs.

We have included this\nsay-on-pay for consideration at the Annual Meeting pursuant to the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange\nAct. In a nonbinding, advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes held at our 2023 annual meeting, our\nshareholders voted in favor of conducting say-on-pay votes annually. In light of this result, and other factors\nconsidered by our Board, our Board determined that we would hold say-on-pay votes on an annual basis until the\nnext advisory vote on such frequency, which we expect to take place at our 2029 annual shareholders meeting\nAs described in more detail in the CD&A, the overall objectives of the Company’s compensation program\nhave been to align NEO compensation with the success of meeting strategic and financial goals. Shareholders are\nurged to read the CD&A, Executive Compensation, Summary Compensation Table, and other related compensation\ntables and narrative disclosure that describe the compensation of our NEOs in 2023. The Compensation Committee\nand Board believe that the information provided regarding the compensation of our NEOs in this Proxy Statement\ndemonstrates that our executive compensation program was designed appropriately and is working to maximize\nshareholder return while mitigating risk and aligning managements’ interests with our shareholders. Accordingly,\nthe Board recommends that shareholders approve the following advisory resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that Merchants Bancorp’s shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, its executive\ncompensation paid to its Named Executive Officers as disclosed and described in its 2024 Proxy Statement,\nincluding the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Executive Compensation, and Summary Compensation\nTable, and other related compensation tables and narrative disclosure.”\nApproval of this resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the\nAnnual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. While this advisory vote is required, it is not binding on our\nBoard and may not be construed as overruling any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation Committee\nwill take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation arrangements.\nThe Board recommends that you vote to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs by voting\n“FOR” this proposal.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe below table sets forth the following information as of the Record Date regarding the beneficial\nownership of our common stock for:\n• each shareholder known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock;\n• each of our directors and nominees;\n• each of our NEOs; and\n• all of our directors, nominees, and executive officers as a group.\nWe have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally\nprovide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the\nvoting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities, or has the right to acquire such powers\nwithin 60 days. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this table, we believe that each person identified in the table\nhas sole voting and investment power over all of the shares shown opposite such person’s name.\nThe percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 43,354,718 shares of our common stock outstanding as\nof the Record Date.\n32\nThe address for each shareholder listed in the table below is: c/o Merchants Bancorp, 410 Monon\nBoulevard, Carmel, Indiana, 46032.\nAmount and Nature of\nBeneficial Ownership (1)\nName Num ber %\n5% shareholders:\nJody J.

Our directors and executive officers are also required to furnish us with copies of all such\nSection 16(a) reports they file. These reports are available on our website (investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under\nthe filings section.\nBased on a review of these reports, and on written representations from our reporting persons, we believe\nthat all such Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors and executive officers were satisfied during\n2023 with the exception of a Form 4 for Mr. Petrie that was not filed on time for a bona fide gift of our common\nstock made by his spouse.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described in Executive\nCompensation above, the following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2023, to which we have been a\nparty in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive\nofficers, or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or their immediate family members or entities\naffiliated with them, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nEmployment Relationships with Related Parties\nWe employ Matt Kaercher, the son-in-law of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael J. Petrie,\nas Senior Vice President – Midwest/Correspondent Lending of Merchants Capital. Mr. Kaercher’s compensation for\n2023 totaled $1,347,092, which consisted of a base salary, production bonus, and benefits.\nPayment for Services of Related Parties\nWe retain the services of various law firms, including Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, a law firm where one of our\nnominees, Thomas W. Dinwiddie, is a partner. In 2023, Dinsmore & Shohl LLP received $9.4 million in total fees\nrelated to our businesses, primarily related to the documentation of loan originations and loan collections for\nMerchants Bank. However, of such amount, only $2.2 million was paid directly by us while the remaining $7.2\nmillion was paid by third parties, such as by borrowers in connection with closing their loans.\nOrdinary Banking Relationships\nCertain of our directors, officers, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, and their\nassociates were customers of, and had transactions with, us in the past and additional transactions with these persons\n34\nare expected to take place in the future. All outstanding loans and commitments to loan with these persons were\nmade in the ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to us, and did not involve\nmore than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. All such loans are approved by the\nboard of directors of Merchants Bank in accordance with bank regulatory requirements. Similarly, all certificates of\ndeposit and depository relationships with these persons were made in the ordinary course of business and involved\nsubstantially the same terms, including interest rates, as those prevailing at the time for comparable depository\nrelationships with persons not related to us.\nPolicies and Procedures Regarding Related Party Transactions\nTransactions by us, Merchants Bank, and certain of our other subsidiaries with related parties, are subject to\ncertain regulatory requirements and restrictions, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (which\ngovern certain transactions by Merchants Bank with its affiliates) and the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System’s Regulation O (which governs certain loans by Merchants Bank to its executive officers, directors,\nand principal shareholders).\nUnder applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules, related party transactions are transactions in which we are a\nparticipant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest. Our related parties include directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive officers, 5%\nshareholders, and the immediate family members of these persons or entities affiliated with them. In accordance\nwith our Audit Committee Charter, related party transactions are evaluated in accordance with our Code of Conduct.\nIn determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee will consider, among other\nfactors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or indirect nature of the related party’s interest in the\ntransaction, the appearance of an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer taking into\naccount the size of the transaction and the financial position of the related party, whether the transaction would\nimpair a Non-Executive Director’s independence, the acceptability of the transaction to our regulators, and the\npotential violations of other corporate policies.\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nOur management is responsible for the internal control over financial reporting. The independent\nregistered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial\nstatements and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee oversees our internal controls and\nfinancial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee has met and held discussions with\nmanagement and the independent registered public accounting firm on these matters. Management represented to the\nAudit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the\nconsolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The\nAudit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed\nby Auditing Standard 1301, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including the quality,\nand not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the\nclarity of the disclosures in the financial statements.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent\nregistered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm’s independence\nfrom us and our management. In concluding that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent,\nthe Audit Committee considered, among other factors, whether the non-audit services provided by the firm were\ncompatible with its independence.\nThe Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope\nand plans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with\nand without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of our internal control\nover financial reporting, and the overall quality of our financial reporting process.\n35\nIn performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts only in an oversight capacity. In its\noversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of our management, which has the primary\nresponsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the independent registered public accounting firm who, in\nits report, expresses an opinion on the conformity of our financial statements to accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee’s oversight does not provide it with an independent\nbasis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or\npolicies, or appropriate internal control over financial reporting designed to assure compliance with accounting\nstandards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee’s considerations and discussions\nwith management and the independent registered public accounting firm do not assure that our financial statements\nare presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, that the\naudit of our financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board, or that our independent registered public accounting firm is, in fact, “independent.”\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the\nBoard, and the Board has approved, the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC. The Audit Committee has appointed,\nsubject to shareholder ratification, FORVIS, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2024.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nof Merchants Bancorp\nAndrew A.

Business.\nCompany Overview\nMerchants Bancorp (the “Company,” “Merchants,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), an Indiana corporation formed in\n2006, is a diversified bank holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana and registered under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended. We currently operate in multiple business segments, including Multi-family\nMortgage Banking that offers multi-family housing and healthcare facility financing and servicing (through this segment\nwe also serve as a syndicator of low-income housing tax credit and debt funds); Mortgage Warehousing that offers\nmortgage warehouse financing, commercial loans, and deposit services; and Banking that offers portfolio lending for\nmulti-family and healthcare facility loans, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, agricultural lending,\nSmall Business Administration (“SBA”) lending, and traditional community banking. As of December 31, 2023, we had\n$17.0 billion in assets, $14.1 billion of deposits and $1.7 billion of shareholders’ equity.\nWe were founded in 1990 as a mortgage banking company, providing financing for multi-family housing and\nsenior living properties. The shared vision of our founders, Michael Petrie and Randall Rogers, was to create a\ndiversified financial services company, which efficiently operates both nationally through mortgage banking and related\nservices, and locally through a community bank. We have primarily grown organically and strategically built our\nbusiness model in a way that we believe offers insulation from cyclical economic and credit swings and provides\nsynergies across our lines of business.\nMerchants Bank of Indiana (“Merchants Bank”), one of our wholly owned banking subsidiaries, operates under\nan Indiana charter and provides traditional community banking services, as well as portfolio lending for multi-family and\nhealthcare facility loans, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, SBA lending, and agricultural lending.\nMerchants Bank has six depository branches located in Carmel, Indianapolis, Lynn, Spartanburg, and Richmond,\nIndiana. Until all of its branches were sold to unaffiliated third parties and its remaining charter was merged into\nMerchants Bank in January 2024, Farmers-Merchants Bank of Illinois (“FMBI”), our other wholly owned banking\nsubsidiary, operated under an Illinois charter and provided traditional community banking services and agricultural\nlending. FMBI had four depository branches located in Joy, Paxton, Melvin, and Piper City, Illinois.\nOur business consists primarily of funding fixed rate, low risk loans meeting underwriting standards of\ngovernment programs, under an originate to sell model, while retaining adjustable rate loans as held for investment to\nreduce interest rate risk. The gain on sale of loans and servicing fees generated from the multi-family rental real estate,\nresidential, and SBA loans, as well as fees and fair market value adjustments to servicing related assets, contribute to\nnoninterest income. The funding source is primarily from mortgage custodial, municipal, retail, commercial, and\nbrokered deposits, as well as short-term borrowings. We believe that the combination of net interest income based on\nshort duration assets and liabilities and noninterest income from the sale of low risk profile assets results in lower than\nindustry charge-offs and a lower expense base, which serves to maximize net income and higher than industry\nshareholder return.\nOur Business Segments\nWe have several lines of business and provide various banking and financial services through our subsidiaries.\nOur business segments are defined as multi-family mortgage banking, mortgage warehousing, and banking.\n3\nMulti-Family Mortgage Banking\nMerchants Capital Corp. (“MCC”) and Merchants Capital Servicing, LLC (“MCS”), subsidiaries of Merchants\nBank, are primarily engaged in mortgage banking, specializing in originating and servicing loans for affordable\nmulti-family rental housing and healthcare facility financing. Our mortgage servicing portfolio consists primarily of\nMerchants Bank balance sheet loans, Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”) loans, and affordable Federal National\nMortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) loans. Our\norigination platform and servicing portfolio are significant sources of our noninterest income and deposits. Other\noriginations that are referred to the Banking segment including bridge financing products to refinance, acquire, or\nreposition multi-family housing projects, construction lending for market rate and affordable housing developments, and\nfinancing of need-based healthcare facilities. In some environments, these originations referred to in the Banking\nsegment can represent a significant portion of the Multi-Family Mortgage Banking total origination volume.\nConsistently one of the top ranked agency lenders in the nation, our licenses with FHA and affordable Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac, coupled with our bank financing products, provide sponsors custom beginning-to-end financing\nsolutions that adapt to an ever-changing market. We are also an approved United States Department of Agriculture\n(“USDA”) Rural Housing 538 lender. This cost-effective, reliable funding source is a powerful tool in expanding the\navailability of affordable housing in rural markets that often have the greatest need. We also offer customized loan\nproducts for need-based skilled nursing facilities, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care. A\nvariety of loan products are available to accommodate acquisition, rehabilitation, and refinancing of healthcare\nproperties throughout the country. These loans are underwritten with the intent to convert FHA permanent loans within\nthree years.\nIn addition to the loans originated directly through our Multi-Family Mortgage Banking segment, we also fund\nloans brought to us by non-affiliated entities and service or sub-service loans for a fee.\nMCC is also a fully integrated tax credit equity syndicator. Our syndication platform, paired with our\ncomprehensive suite of debt offerings, allows us to deliver financing on all aspects of affordable housing transactions.\nThe tax credit equity team specializes in tax-advantaged affordable housing projects with Section 42 Low-Income\nHousing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”), Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, and State tax credits. The investors in MCC’s\nsyndicated funds are institutional investors comprised of banks, insurance companies, and large publicly traded\ncorporations. All funds are underwritten and serviced in-house.\nAdditionally, through Merchants Asset Management, LLC (“MAM”), we serve as a registered investment\nadvisor that deploys third party investor capital into high quality assets originated by MCC. These debt investment\nvehicles ultimately support the mission of MCC by creating additional lending capacity and competitive loan terms for\nclients. We also optimize our capital position and manage our balance sheet through credit risk transfer vehicles and\nsecuritizations.\nThrough the Multi-Family Mortgage Banking segment, many of our fixed rate originated loans are sold to\ngovernment agencies as mortgage-backed securities within approximately 30 days. As these loans are sold, servicing\nrights are traditionally retained. We believe that MCC is one of the largest government agency servicers in the country\nbased on aggregate loan principal balance. Our capital markets team also has expertise in facilitating larger scale\nsecuritization initiatives, both privately and with government agencies, to successfully manage our capital efficiency,\nmaximize liquidity, and minimize credit risk on our balance sheet.\nOne of the segment’s primary sources of funding is the national secondary mortgage market of federally\nchartered agencies and the federal government. Another primary source of funding is our Banking segment. Investors in\nthe secondary market are primarily large financial institutions, brokerage companies, insurance companies and real\nestate investment trusts. These programs facilitate secondary market activities in order to provide funding for the\nmulti-family mortgage market.\nMortgage Warehousing\nWe started the warehouse lending business in 2009 because of dislocation in the market. Merchants Bank\ncurrently has warehouse repurchase agreements, loan participations, operating lines of credit collateralized by mortgage\n4\nservicing rights, and custodial deposits with some of the largest non-depository financial institutions and mortgage\nbankers in the industry.\nOur Mortgage Warehousing segment provides asset-based financing in the form of warehouse facilities to\neligible non-depository financial institutions and mortgage bankers, which enables them to fund and inventory\nresidential and multi-family mortgage loans until they are sold and purchased in the secondary market by an approved\ninvestor. The warehouse financing facilities are secured by residential and multi-family mortgage loans underwritten to\nstandards approved by Merchants Bank that are generally comparable to those established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,\nFHA and Veterans Affairs (“VA”).\nMortgage Warehousing funded $78.3 billion of loan principal in 2021, $33.2 billion in 2022 and $33.0 billion\nin 2023. The primary source of liquidity is provided by custodial and corporate deposits of its customers.\nBanking\nThe Banking segment includes retail banking, commercial lending, agricultural lending, retail and\ncorrespondent residential mortgage banking, and SBA lending. Retail banking operates primarily in central Indiana and\nRichmond. Our correspondent mortgage banking business, like Multi-family Mortgage Banking and Mortgage\nWarehousing, is a national business. Our SBA lending is currently a regional business with offices in four states. The\nBanking segment has a well-diversified customer and borrower base and has experienced significant growth over the\npast three years.\nCommercial Lending and Retail Banking\nMerchants Bank holds loans in its portfolio comprised of multi-family and healthcare bridge loans and multi-\nfamily construction loans referred by MCC, owner occupied commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial\nloans, agricultural loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Merchants Bank receives deposits from\ncustomers located primarily in Hamilton, Marion, Randolph and surrounding counties in Indiana and from the escrows\ngenerated by the servicing activities of MCC and MCS. Until its branches were sold in January 2024, FMBI received\ndeposits from and made loans to customers located through multiple branches in Illinois.\nAgricultural Lending\nMerchants Bank’s Lynn and Richmond, Indiana offices primarily offer agricultural loans within its designated\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) assessment area of Randolph and Wayne counties in Eastern Indiana and nearby\nDarke County, Ohio. FMBI primarily provided agricultural loans within its designated CRA assessment area of Mercer\nCounty in Western Illinois and Ford County in East Central Illinois. Merchants Bank offers operating lines of credit for\ncrop and livestock production, intermediate term financing to purchase agricultural equipment and breeding livestock\nand long-term financing to purchase agricultural real estate. Merchants Bank is approved to sell agricultural loans in the\nsecondary market through the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and uses this relationship to\nmanage interest rate risk within the agricultural loan portfolio. Merchants Bank is also a Certified Lender with the Farm\nService Agency to offset credit risk inherent in the Agriculture loan portfolio.\nSingle-Family Mortgage Lending, Correspondent Lending and Servicing\nMerchants Mortgage is the branded division of Merchants Bank that is a single-family mortgage origination and\nservicing platform. Merchants Mortgage is both a retail and correspondent mortgage lender. Merchants Mortgage is an\napproved originator of FHA, VA, and USDA loans and approved seller servicer by Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (“Ginnie Mae”), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Merchants Mortgage offers agency eligible, jumbo fixed and\nhybrid adjustable-rate mortgages for purchase or refinancing of single-family residences. Other products include\nconstruction, bridge and lot financing, and first-lien home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”). Loans held for sale\ngenerate revenues from fees charged to borrowers, interest income during the warehouse period, gain on sale of loans to\ninvestors, and servicing fee income. There are multiple investor outlets, including direct sale capability to Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Indianapolis, and other third-party investors to allow Merchants\nMortgage a best execution at sale. Merchants Mortgage also originates loans held for investment and earns interest\nincome over the life of the loan.\n5\nSBA Lending\nMerchants Bank participates in the SBA’s 7(a), 504 and Express programs to meet the needs of our small\nbusiness communities and help diversify our retail revenue stream. In January 2018, Merchants Bank was awarded\nPreferred Lender Program status, the SBA’s highest level of approval that a lender can hold. This designation provides\nus delegated loan approval, closing and servicing authority that enables loan decisions to be made more rapidly. In\nDecember 2019, the Company added a new team of SBA originators, located in Illinois and Indiana, and expanding into\nOhio and Texas, to help broaden our reach to small business owners in and around these states.\nStrategy for Complementary Segments\nOur segments diversify the net income of Merchants Bank and provide synergies across the segments. Strategic\nopportunities come from MCC and MCS, where loans are funded by the Banking segment and the Banking segment\nprovides Ginnie Mae custodial services to MCC and MCS. LIHTC syndication and debt fund offerings complement the\nlending activities of new and existing multi-family mortgage customers. The securities available for sale and held to\nmaturity funded by MCC custodial deposits or purchases of securitized loans originated by MCC are pledged to FHLB\nto provide advance capacity during periods of high residential loan volume for Mortgage Warehousing. Mortgage\nWarehousing provides leads to Correspondent Residential Lending in the Banking segment. Retail and commercial\ncustomers provide cross selling opportunities within the banking segment. Merchants Mortgage is a risk mitigant to\nMortgage Warehousing because it provides us with a ready platform to sell the underlying collateral to secure\nrepayment. These and other synergies form a part of our strategic plan.\nSee Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -\nOperating Segment Analysis for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022” and Note 26: Segment Information for\nfurther information about our segments.\nCompetition\nWe compete in several areas, including commercial and retail banking, SBA, residential mortgages, warehouse\nlending, and multi-family FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac affordable loan originations in the multi-family and\nhealthcare sectors. These industries are highly competitive, and the Company faces strong direct competition for\ndeposits, loans, and loan originations and other financial-related services. We compete with other non-depository\nfinancial institutions and community banks, thrifts and credit unions. Although some of these competitors are situated\nlocally, others have statewide or regional presence. In addition, we compete with large banks and other financial\nintermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage banking companies, business leasing\nand finance companies, insurance companies, multi-family loan origination businesses, securities firms, mutual funds\nand certain government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and\nother financial services. Additionally, we face growing competition from online businesses with few or no physical\nlocations, including online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated\nretirement and investment service providers. We believe that the range and quality of products that we offer, the\nknowledge of our personnel and our emphasis on building long-lasting relationships, along with our diversified business\nmodel, sets us apart from our competitors.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 618 employees located in multiple states, including 364\nemployees in Central Indiana. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to\na collective bargaining agreement.\nWe regularly solicit feedback from our employees to gain a better understanding of why they may enjoy\nworking at Merchants and what areas of improvement there may be. Feedback from such surveys is reviewed by senior\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and the leader of each of our business units, and is generally used to\ndevelop ways in which our employees’ experiences can be improved and/or work can become more efficient. We\nbelieve that our relations with employees are positive. For example, we were named to the list of “Best Places to Work\nin Indiana” by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce every year from 2016 to 2022 and were named as a “Top Workplace”\nby The Indianapolis Star in 2023 and in 2023 our turnover rate was only 10%. Additionally, in order to reward\nemployees for their contributions towards our success and to help ensure that our employees are more aligned with our\n6\nshareholders, in 2020 we established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”). Under the ESOP, from time to time\nwe may make a contribution of newly issued shares of our common stock or cash to purchase shares of our common\nstock, which is then allocated to eligible employees. The ESOP contribution is completely funded by the Company and\nis in addition to all other wages, incentives, and benefits, and requires nothing from our employees other than their\nongoing hard work and dedication. We make a discretionary contribution equal to 3% of an employee’s eligible\ncompensation under our 401(k) plan each pay period regardless of whether such employee also contributed. Our\ncontribution is in the form of cash and is invested according to the employee’s current investment allocation.\nAdditionally, while the health and safety of our employees is always the highest priority, we continuously\nevaluate our efforts and we make changes or accommodations to help ensure employees remain healthy, safe, and\nproductive.\nEnvironment, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Activities\nAs a mission-driven company committed to incorporating ESG into its business framework, we manage with a\nstrong focus on sustainable, long-term growth and value creation. We believe our ESG approach underscores this\ncommitment and provides tangible benefits for our customers, employees, and shareholders.\nAs one of the largest government-sponsored entity multi-family lenders in the country, a significant portion of\nour business has been centered on supporting the financing needs of affordable housing projects as well as need-based\nskilled nursing for seniors and related healthcare facilities.\nTo further demonstrate our ESG commitment to sustainable cities and communities, Merchants Bank has\nacquired private equity interests in affordable housing projects that generate low-income housing tax credits through its\ntax credit equity funds. The affordable housing projects target low-income individuals. MCC has a commitment to\nenvironmental and social risk mitigation, disclosures around project selection and evaluation, management of proceeds,\nand reporting on allocation and impact metrics. The Company received a second-party opinion from Sustainalytics\nstating that our ESG focused Tax Credit Equity Fund framework is credible, impactful and will deliver overall positive\nsocial impacts.\nA foundation of our culture is our approach to employee engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion\n(“DEI”). We embrace diversity and inclusion, which we believe fosters creativity, innovation and thought leadership\nthrough the infusion of new ideas and perspectives. Our commitment to DEI also led to the creation of an employee level\ncommittee focused on DEI and our hiring of an individual who leads our DEI efforts, including such committee. Some\nactivities that have been launched include regular educational events for all employees and an open forum for DEI topics\nof discussion. We also have highly engaged leadership in our Board that is made up of diverse members and\ndemonstrates our dedication to this area of focus in our company. Additionally, our Board meets all Nasdaq diversity\nrequirements.\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 410 Monon Blvd., Carmel, Indiana 46032, and our telephone\nnumber at that address is (317) 569-7420. Through our website at www.merchantsbancorp.com under “Investors,” we\nmake available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on\nForm 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”). Those filings can also be obtained on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additionally, from time to time we\nmay post other press releases, news, investor presentations and stories regarding our business on the News and\nPresentation sections of our website’s Investor page. The information contained on our website is not a part of, or\nincorporated by reference into, this report.\n7\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nInsured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law.\nAs a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general\neconomic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of\nvarious bank regulatory agencies, including the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (“IDFI”), Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service\nand state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\nanti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) and mortgage related\nrules, including with respect to loan securitization and servicing by HUD and agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae,\nand Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules\nare significant to our operations and results, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes\naffecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.\nFederal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on\nthe operations of financial institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection\nof the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and\nthe regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the\nkinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature\nand amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings\nwith insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. The Company has been subject to continuous monitoring since\nit exceeded $10 billion in total assets.\nThis supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination\nby their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly\navailable, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance,\nearnings, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad\ndiscretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine,\namong other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise\ninconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.\nThe following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to\nus. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the\nrequirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular\nstatutory and regulatory provision.\nMerchants Bancorp\nBank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended\nWe, as the sole shareholder of Merchants Bank are a bank holding company (“BHC”) within the meaning of the\nBank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a BHC, we are subject to the supervision,\nexamination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of Federal Reserve. The BHC Act requires a\nBHC to file an annual report of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require.\nAcquisition of Banks\nGenerally, the BHC Act governs the acquisition and control of banks and nonbanking companies by BHCs.\nA BHC’s acquisition of 5% or more of the voting shares of any other bank or BHC generally requires the prior\napproval of the Federal Reserve and is subject to applicable federal and state law. The Federal Reserve evaluates\nacquisition applications based on, among other things, competitive factors, supervisory factors, adequacy of financial\nand managerial resources, and banking and community needs considerations.\n8\nThe BHC Act also prohibits, with certain exceptions, a BHC from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares of any “nonbanking” company unless the Federal Reserve finds the\nnonbanking activities be “so closely related to banking . . . as to be a proper incident thereto” or another exception\napplies. The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of a BHC or its nonbank subsidiaries.\nThe BHC Act and Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, prohibit acquisition of\n“control” of a bank or BHC without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators. The BHC Act defines “control,” in\ncertain cases, as the acquisition of as little as 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting stock. Furthermore,\nunder certain circumstances, a BHC may not be able to purchase its own shares where the gross consideration will equal\n10% or more of the Company’s net worth, without obtaining approval of the Federal Reserve.\nThe Federal Reserve Act subjects banks and their affiliates to certain requirements and restrictions when\ndealing with each other (affiliate transactions include transactions between a bank and its BHC).\nPermitted Activities\nUnder the BHC Act, a BHC and its nonbank subsidiaries are generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct\nor indirect control of the voting shares of companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities that the Federal\nReserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including:\n• factoring accounts receivable;\n• making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the\nforegoing;\n• leasing personal or real property under certain conditions;\n• operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association;\n• engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law;\n• financial and investment advisory activities;\n• discount securities brokerage activities;\n• underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments;\n• providing specified management consulting and counseling activities;\n• performing selected data processing services and support services;\n• acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with\ncredit transactions; and\n• performing selected insurance underwriting activities.\nThe Federal Reserve may order a BHC or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its\nownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the BHC’s continued ownership,\nactivity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank\nsubsidiaries. A qualifying BHC that elects to be treated as a financial holding company may also engage in, or acquire\ndirect or indirect control of the voting shares of companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental\nto such financial activity or are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and\nsoundness of the institution or the financial system generally. We have not elected, and presently do not intend to elect,\nto be treated as a financial holding company.\n9\nSupport of Subsidiary Institutions\nThe Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. Pursuant to such regulations a BHC should stand ready to use\nits resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity.\nRepurchase or Redemption of Shares\nA BHC is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of\nits own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with\nthe net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or\nmore of the Company’s consolidated net worth. Additionally, under the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Q, a BHC is\nrequired to obtain the Federal Reserve’s approval prior to the repurchase or redemption of any shares of our preferred\nstock. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would\nconstitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or\nany condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an\nexception to this approval requirement for repurchase or redemptions of common stock for well-capitalized BHCs that\nmeet certain conditions.\nIf the Company elects to repurchase or redeem its equity securities, it will generally incur a 1% excise tax on\nthe fair market value of any stock of the corporation that is repurchased, as required in the Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022. However, the Company may not be subject to such excise tax to the extent it issues an equal to or greater than\namount of stock (based on fair market value) in the same calendar year.\nMerchants Bank\nMerchants Bank is an Indiana chartered, non-Federal Reserve member bank subject to supervision and\nregulation by the FDIC and IDFI.\nBank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), enacted as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, requires\nfinancial institutions to maintain records of certain customers and currency transactions and to report certain domestic\nand foreign currency transactions, which may have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory\ninvestigations or proceedings. This law requires financial institutions to develop a BSA compliance program.\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct\nTerrorism Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”), is comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation. Title III of the Patriot Act requires\nfinancial institutions to help prevent and detect international money laundering and the financing of terrorism and\nprosecute those involved in such activities. The Treasury has adopted additional requirements to further implement Title\nIII.\nThese regulations have established a mechanism for law enforcement officials to communicate names of\nsuspected terrorists and money launderers to financial institutions, enabling financial institutions to promptly locate\naccounts and transactions involving those suspects. Financial institutions receiving names of suspects must search their\naccount and transaction records for potential matches and report positive results to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (“FinCEN”). Each financial institution must designate a point of contact to receive information\nrequests. These regulations outline how financial institutions can share information concerning suspected terrorist and\nmoney laundering activity with other financial institutions under the protection of a statutory safe harbor if each financial\ninstitution notifies FinCEN of its intent to share information. The Treasury has also adopted regulations to prevent\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing through correspondent accounts that U.S. financial institutions maintain on\nbehalf of foreign banks. These regulations also require financial institutions to take reasonable steps to ensure that they\nare not providing banking services directly or indirectly to foreign shell banks. In addition, banks must have procedures\nto verify the identity of their customers.\nMerchants Bank established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the BSA and a customer\nidentification program pursuant to the Patriot Act. Merchants Bank also maintains records of cash purchases of\n10\nnegotiable instruments, file reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and report\nsuspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the BSA.\nMerchants Bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements.\nFDIC Improvement Act of 1991\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) amended the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act to require, among other things, federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective\naction” with respect to banks which do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers:\nwell capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\nThe FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA.\n“Undercapitalized” banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan.\nThe bank’s BHC is required to guarantee that the bank will comply with the plan and provide appropriate assurances of\nperformance. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly\nundercapitalized. “Significantly undercapitalized” banks are subject to one or more restrictions, including an order by the\nFDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cease\nreceipt of deposits from correspondent banks, and restrictions on compensation of executive officers. “Critically\nundercapitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming “critically undercapitalized,” make any\npayment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt or extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction or enter\ninto any transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, “critically undercapitalized” institutions are\nsubject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. Any bank that is not “well capitalized” is subject to limitations, and\na prohibition in the case of any bank that is “undercapitalized,” on the acceptance, renewal, or roll over of any brokered\ndeposit.\nCurrently, a “well capitalized” institution is one that has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1\nrisk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital\nratio of at least 6.5%, and is not subject to regulatory direction to maintain a specific level for any capital measure.\nCurrently, a “well capitalized with Basel III capital conservation buffer” institution is one that has a total\nrisk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.5%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at\nleast 5%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 7%, and is not subject to regulatory direction to\nmaintain a specific level for any capital measure.\nAt December 31, 2023, Merchants Bank was well capitalized, and also well capitalized with the Basel III\ncapital conservation buffer, as defined by applicable regulations.\nCapital Requirements and Basel III\nApart from the capital levels for insured depository institutions that were established by FDICIA for the prompt\ncorrective action regime discussed above, the federal regulators have issued rules that impose minimum capital\nrequirements on both insured depository institutions and their holding companies. Although the rules contain certain\nstandards applicable only to large, internationally active banks, many of them apply to all banking organizations,\nincluding Merchants Bank. The institutions and companies subject to the rules are referred to collectively herein as\n“covered” banking organizations. By virtue of a provision in The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) known as the Collins Amendment, the requirements must be the same at both the\ninstitution level and the holding company level. The minimum capital rules have undergone several revisions over the\nyears. The current requirements, which began to take effect in 2015, are based on the international Basel III capital\nframework. These requirements apply to all covered banking organizations (including us) with some requirements\nphasing in over time.\nHowever, on November 21, 2017, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and\nFDIC finalized a joint proposal and adopted a final rule (the “Transitions Rule”) pursuant to which the current regulatory\ncapital treatment then in place for servicing rights, certain temporary difference deferred tax assets, and significant\ninvestments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions was indefinitely extended in anticipation of a\nsubsequent notice of proposed rulemaking by such regulators to simplify the regulatory capital treatment of such items\n11\n(the “Simplification Rule”). The extension of the capital rules with respect to servicing rights was the only portion of the\nTransitions Rule that was material to the Company.\nOn July 9, 2019, the federal regulators finalized and adopted the final Simplification Rule. Under the prior\nrules, including the Transitions Rule, servicing rights, net of related deferred tax liabilities, that are in excess of 10% of\ncommon equity or when combined with certain other deduction items are in excess of 15% of common equity are\ndeducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Under the Simplification Rule, on January 1, 2020, this threshold was\nraised to 25% of common equity. However, the non-deducted portion of servicing rights must be risk weighted at 250%.\nOn November 13, 2019, the federal regulators finalized and adopted a regulatory capital rule establishing a new\ncommunity bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. Eligibility criteria to utilize\nCBLR included having total assets less than $10 billion and off-balance sheet exposures that were less than 25% of total\nassets, among others. The Company, Merchants Bank, and FMBI elected to begin using CBLR in the first quarter of\n2020 and utilized this measure of reporting through June 30, 2022.\nAt September 30, 2022 the Company’s total assets exceeded $10 billion, off-balance sheets exposures exceeded\n25% of total assets, and the allowable grace periods under the CBLR rules expired. Accordingly, the Company began\nreporting fully phased-in Basel III risk-based capital ratios as of September 30, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the most recent notifications from the Federal Reserve categorized the Company as\nwell capitalized and most recent notifications from the FDIC categorized Merchants Bank as well capitalized under the\nregulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that\nmanagement believes have changed the Company’s or Merchants Bank’s category.\nDeposit Insurance Fund and Financing Corporation Assessments\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures the deposits of Merchants Bank up to $250,000 per\ndepositor, qualifying joint accounts, and certain other accounts. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository\ninstitutions an insurance premium. The FDIC’s risk-based assessment system requires insured institutions to pay deposit\ninsurance premiums based on the risk that each institution poses to the DIF. The rate is applied to the institution’s total\naverage consolidated assets during the assessment period less average tangible equity (i.e., Tier 1 capital).\nIn 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all insured depository institutions, to increase initial base\ndeposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment\nperiod of 2023. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the Designated Reserve Ratio (“DRR”) for the DIF at 2% for\n2023. The increase in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF\nreaches the statutory minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The new assessment rate\nschedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2% in order to support growth in the\nDIF in progressing toward the FDIC’s long-term goal of a 2% DRR. Progressively lower assessment rate schedules will\ntake effect when the reserve ratio reaches 2%, and again when it reaches 2.5%.\nBeginning in 2023, large banks (generally, those with $10 billion or more in assets) are assigned an individual\nrate based on a scorecard. The scorecard combines the following measures to produce a score that is converted to an\nassessment rate:\n• CAMELS component ratings that evaluate five critical elements of a credit union's operations:\n(C)apital adequacy, (A)sset quality, (M)anagement, (E)arnings, and (L)iquidity and asset-liability\nmanagement,\n• financial measures used to measure a bank's ability to withstand asset-related and funding-related\nstress, and\n• a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in\nthe event of the bank's failure.\nBecause the Company is classified as a large bank under the new assessment structure, deposit insurance\npremiums are expected to be higher than in previous years.\n12\nIn December 2023, the FDIC also imposed a special assessment on banks with assets over $5 billion to\nreplenish its deposit insurance fund, which was depleted with the collapses of several banks in March 2023. Banks will\nbe assessed a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points for a projected total of eight quarters on uninsured deposits over $5\nbillion, subject to various adjustments. Merchants Bank has not been subject to this special assessment, as it has less than\n$5 billion in uninsured deposits.\nDividends\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from Merchants Bank. There are various legal limitations on the\nextent to which Merchants Bank can supply funds to us. Our principal source of funds consists of dividends from\nMerchants Bank. State and federal law restrict the amount of dividends that banks may pay to its shareholders or BHC.\nThe specific limits depend on a number of factors, including the bank’s type of charter, recent earnings, recent\ndividends, level of capital and liquidity, and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain\ncircumstances are required, to prohibit the payment of dividends or other distributions if the regulators determine that\nmaking such payments would be an unsafe or unsound practice. For example, a bank is generally prohibited from\nmaking any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) to its BHC if the distribution would cause the bank to\nbecome undercapitalized.\nIn addition, under Indiana law, Merchants Bank must obtain the approval of the IDFI prior to the payment of\nany dividend if the total of all dividends declared by Merchants Bank during the calendar year, including any proposed\ndividend, would exceed the sum of its net income for the year to date combined with its retained net income for the\nprevious two years.\nCapital regulations also limit a depository institution’s ability to make capital distributions if it does not hold\ncapital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the required minimum risk-based capital ratios. Regulators also review and\nlimit proposed dividend payments as part of the supervisory process and review of an institution’s capital planning. In\naddition to dividend limitations, Merchants Bank is subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to us, on\ninvestments in our shares or other securities and in taking such shares or securities as collateral for loans.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe CRA requires that the federal banking regulators evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting\nthe credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Regulators also consider\nthese factors in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet\nthese criteria could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on Merchants Bank. The Company\nis currently operating under an approved CRA strategic plan through 2025.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act represented a sweeping\nreform of the U.S. supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions and capital markets in the\nwake of the global financial crisis, certain aspects of which are described below in more detail. In particular, and among\nother things, the Dodd-Frank Act: (i) created a Financial Stability Oversight Council as part of a regulatory structure for\nidentifying emerging systemic risks and improving interagency cooperation; (ii) created the CFPB, which is authorized\nto regulate providers of consumer credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services;\n(iii) narrowed the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws enjoyed by national banks and federal savings\nassociations and expanded the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection\nlegislation; (iv) imposed more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies and subjected certain activities,\nincluding interstate mergers and acquisitions, to heightened capital conditions; (v) with respect to mortgage lending,\n(a) significantly expanded requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property, (b) imposed\nstrict rules on mortgage servicing, and (c) required the originator of a securitized loan, or the sponsor of a securitization,\nto retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securitized exposures unless the underlying exposures are qualified residential\nmortgages or meet certain underwriting standards; (vi) repealed the prohibition on the payment of interest on business\nchecking accounts; (vii) restricted the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for issuers with $10 billion in\nassets or greater; (viii) in the so-called “Volcker Rule,” subject to numerous exceptions, prohibited depository\ninstitutions and affiliates from certain investments in, and sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds and from\nengaging in proprietary trading; (ix) provided for enhanced regulation of advisers to private funds and of the derivatives\n13\nmarkets; (x) enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies; and (xi) prohibited banking agency requirements tied to credit\nratings. These statutory changes shifted the regulatory framework for financial institutions, impacted the way in which\nthey do business and have the potential to constrain revenues. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically\nimportant financial service providers, their influence is expected to filter down in varying degrees to smaller institutions\nover time.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\nMerchants Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for\nmaintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws\nrequire banks to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and\npermitting customers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain\ncircumstances. They also impact a bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for\nmarketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, banks are required\nto implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical\nsafeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information.\nTo combat the ever-present cyber risks, the Company maintains a comprehensive Information Security\nProgram, which includes annual risk assessments, an Incident Response Plan, and a layered control environment meant\nto protect, detect, respond, and limit unauthorized or harmful actions across our information technology (“IT”)\nenvironment. Standards over information security are Board-approved and various types of control testing is conducted\nthroughout the year, by internal and external parties. Recommendations are implemented and reported to various\ncommittees. These security and privacy policies and procedures, for the protection of personal and confidential\ninformation, are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations.\nConsumer Financial Services\nThe structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial\nproducts and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to oversee and\nenforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection\nlaws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including Merchants Bank, as well as the authority to\nprohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over\ninsured depository institutions and their holding companies that have more than $10 billion in assets for at least four\nconsecutive quarters. Merchants Bank had four consecutive quarters during 2023.\nBecause abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the financial\ncrisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage-related\nproducts, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting\nrequirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating\npredatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new\nstandards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly\nencourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain\n“qualified mortgages.” In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic\ninterest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer\nissues, if the loans do not comply with the ability-to-repay standards described below. The risk retention requirement\ngenerally is 5%, but could be increased or decreased by regulation. Merchants Bank does not currently expect the\nCFPB’s rules to have a significant impact on its operations, except for higher compliance costs.\nS.A.F.E. Act\nRegulations issued under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the “S.A.F.E.\nAct”) require residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of institutions regulated by the foregoing\nagencies, including national banks, to meet the registration requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act. The S.A.F.E. Act requires\nresidential mortgage loan originators who are employees of regulated financial institutions to register with the\nNationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nand the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators\n14\nby the states. The S.A.F.E. Act generally prohibits employees of regulated financial institutions from originating\nresidential mortgage loans unless they obtain and annually maintain registration as a registered mortgage loan originator.\nMortgage Origination\nThe CFPB’s “ability to repay” rule, among other things, requires lenders to consider a consumer’s ability to\nrepay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer, and limits prepayment penalties. The rule also\nestablishes certain protections from liability for mortgage lenders with regard to the “qualified mortgages” they\noriginate. This rule includes within the definition of a “qualified mortgage” a loan with a borrower debt-to-income ratio\nof less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they\noperate under federal conservatorship or receivership (“GSE Patch”), and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the\nFHA, VA or USDA. However, on December 10, 2020 the CFPB adopted a new final rule removing the 43% debt-to-\nincome ratio and GSE Patch from the definition of a “qualified mortgage” and replacing it with an annual percentage\nrate limit, while still requiring the consideration of the debt-to-income ratio, which became effective for all loans\napplications after June 30, 2021. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not: (i) contain excess upfront points and fees;\n(ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest−only or negative amortization payments. The rule has not\nhad a significant impact on our mortgage production operations since most of the loans Merchants Bank currently\noriginates would constitute “qualified mortgages” under the rule, including under the revised definition that became\neffective on June 30, 2021.\nMortgage Servicing\nAdditionally, the CFPB has issued a series of final rules as part of an ongoing effort to address mortgage\nservicing reforms and create uniform standards for the mortgage servicing industry. The rules increase requirements for\ncommunications with borrowers, address requirements around the maintenance of customer account records, govern\nprocedural requirements for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, and provide guidance\naround servicing of delinquent loans, foreclosure proceedings and loss mitigation efforts, among other measures. Since\nbecoming effective in 2014, these rules have increased the costs to service loans across the mortgage industry, including\nour mortgage servicing operations.\nSeveral state agencies overseeing the mortgage industry have entered into settlements and enforcement consent\norders with mortgage servicers regarding certain foreclosure practices. These settlements and orders generally require\nservicers, among other things, to: (i) modify their servicing and foreclosure practices, for example, by improving\ncommunications with borrowers and prohibiting dual-tracking, which occurs when servicers continue to pursue\nforeclosure during the loan modification process; (ii) establish a single point of contact for borrowers throughout the\nloan modification and foreclosure processes; and (iii) establish robust oversight and controls of third party vendors,\nincluding outside legal counsel, that provide default management or foreclosure services. Although we are not a party to\nany of these settlements or consent orders, we, like many mortgage servicers, have voluntarily adopted many of these\nservicing and foreclosure standards due to competitive pressures.\nConsumer Laws\nMerchants Bank must comply with a number of federal consumer protection laws, including, among others:\n• the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires a bank to maintain privacy with respect to certain consumer\ndata in its possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters;\n• the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposed a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial\nrecords and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;\n• the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of debt collection\ncommunications;\n• the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z thereunder, which requires certain disclosures to consumer\nborrowers regarding the terms of their loans;\n15\n• the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the credit\nhistory of consumers;\n• the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B thereunder, which prohibits discrimination on the basis\nof age, race and certain other characteristics, in the extension of credit;\n• the Homeowners Equity Protection Act, which requires, among other things, the cancellation of mortgage\ninsurance once certain equity levels are reached;\n• the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C thereunder, which require mortgage lenders to report\ncertain public loan data;\n• the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin,\nand certain other characteristics;\n• the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X thereunder, which imposes conditions on the\nconsummation and servicing of mortgage loans;\n• the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD thereunder, which requires certain disclosures to depositors\nconcerning the terms of their deposit accounts; and\n• the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E thereunder, which governs various forms of electronic\nbanking. This statute and regulation often interact with Regulation CC of the Federal Reserve Board, which\ngoverns the settlement of checks and other payment system issues.\nFuture Legislation and Executive Orders\nIn addition to the specific legislation described above, the administration may sign executive orders or\nmemoranda that could directly impact the regulation of the banking industry. Congress is also considering legislation to\nreform certain government sponsored entities (“GSEs”), including ending the federal government’s conservatorship of\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The orders and legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in\nsubstantial and unpredictable ways by increasing or decreasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding\npermissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other\nfinancial institutions.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of and are\nintended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These\nforward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial\nperformance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,”\n“might,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,”\n“estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “goal,” “target,” “outlook,” “aim,” “would,” “annualized” and “outlook,” or\nthe negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These\nforward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections\nabout our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their\nnature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution that any such forward-looking\nstatements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties\nthat are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are\nreasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied\nby the forward-looking statements.\nA number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these\nforward-looking statements, including the following:\n• business and economic conditions, particularly those affecting the financial services industry and our\nprimary market areas;\n16\n• our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses on\nloans;\n• factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in\nour primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers and the success of construction\nprojects that we finance, including any loans acquired in acquisition transactions;\n• liquidity issues, including fluctuations in the fair value and liquidity of the securities we hold for sale and\nour ability to raise additional capital, if necessary;\n• compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, relating to banking, consumer protection,\nsecurities and tax matters;\n• our ability to maintain licenses required in connection with residential and multi-family mortgage\norigination, sale and servicing operations;\n• our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks, fraud and systems errors;\n• our ability to effectively execute our strategic plan and manage our growth;\n• changes in our senior management team and our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel;\n• governmental monetary and fiscal policies, and changes in market interest rates;\n• effects of competition from a wide variety of local, regional, national and other providers of financial,\ninvestment and insurance services;\n• the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our\nreputation; and\n• changes in federal tax law or policy.\nThe foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other\ncautionary statements included in this report. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is\nmade, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of\nnew information, future developments or otherwise.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below, together with all other information included in this report should be carefully\nconsidered. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nMortgage Banking and Community Banking Risks\nDecreased residential and multi-family mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors, and\nchanges in interest rates, may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe currently operate a residential and multi-family mortgage origination, warehouse financing, and servicing\nbusiness. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our\nmortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale or portfolio of loans, revenues received from servicing such\nloans and the valuation of our servicing rights.\n17\nOur mortgage banking profitability could significantly decline if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume\nof mortgage loans.\nMortgage production, especially refinancing activity, declines in rising interest rate environments. Interest rates\nhad been historically low in recent years, but the market has seen interest rate increases throughout 2023. Moreover, if\ninterest rates increase further, there can be no assurance that our mortgage production will continue at current levels.\nBecause we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate and purchase, the profitability of our mortgage\nbanking business also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them at a gain in\nthe secondary market. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon\n(i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. If\nour level of mortgage production declines, the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs\ncommensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations.\nIn addition, our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the\nprograms offered by government agencies (“agency”), such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, and other\ninstitutional and non-institutional investors. Any significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the agencies could\nmaterially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be\nchanged from time to time by the sponsoring entity, which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan\noriginations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors,\nincluding our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria.\nThe ability for us and our warehouse financing customers to originate and sell residential mortgage loans\nreadily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn\ndepends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by agencies and other institutional and\nnon-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential\nmortgage loans. Because the largest participants in the secondary market are agencies whose activities are governed by\nfederal law, any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these agencies could, in turn, adversely\naffect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S.\ngovernment. The federal government has for many years considered proposals to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\nbut the results of any such reform, and their impact on us, are difficult to predict. To date, no reform proposal has been\nenacted.\nIf we violate HUD requirements, our multi-family FHA origination and servicing business could be adversely\naffected.\nWe originate, sell and service loans under HUD programs, and make certifications regarding compliance with\napplicable requirements and guidelines. If we were to violate these requirements and guidelines, or other applicable\nlaws, or if the FHA loans we originate show a high frequency of loan defaults, we could be subject to monetary penalties\nand indemnification claims and could be declared ineligible for FHA programs. Any inability to engage in our\nmulti-family FHA origination and servicing business would lead to a decrease in our net income.\nReal estate construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project.\nThese estimates may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nReal estate construction loans involve additional risks because funds are advanced upon security of the project,\nwhich is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate\nmarkets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the\ncompleted project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate\naccurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction\nloans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the\nultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or\nguarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or\nmarket values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of\nconstruction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, we may\nnot be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and\nholding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold\nthe property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it.\n18\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking, mortgage,\nleasing, and providers of multi-family agency financing and servicing, which could harm our business.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other\nfinancial institutions. Our operations consist of offering banking and residential mortgage services, and we also offer\nmulti-family agency financing to generate noninterest income. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider\nvariety of, banking and related financial services within our market areas. These competitors include national banks,\nregional banks and community banks, as well as many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan\ninstitutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial\nintermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices or\notherwise solicit deposits in our market areas. Additionally, we face growing competition from online businesses with\nfew or no physical locations, including online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms. Increased\ncompetition in our markets may result in reduced loans, deposits and commissions and brokers’ fees, as well as reduced\nnet interest margin and profitability. There has also been a rise in financial technology companies that develop new\ntechnology to compete with traditional financial methods in the delivery of financial services. Ultimately, we may not be\nable to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking and\nmortgage customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our business, and our financial condition and results of\noperations may be adversely affected.\nMany of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities\nand may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The financial services industry could become even more\ncompetitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition,\nsome of our current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for\ncredit facilities larger than we may be able to accommodate. Our inability to compete successfully in the markets in\nwhich we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the federal government shuts down or otherwise fails to fully fund the federal budget, our multi-family FHA\norigination business could be adversely affected.\nDisagreement over the federal budget has caused the U.S. federal government to shut down for periods of time\nin recent years. Federal governmental entities, such as HUD, that rely on funding from the federal budget, could be\nadversely affected in the event of a government shut-down, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nmulti-family FHA origination business and our results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may\nmaterially adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nWe are a community bank and known nationally for multi-family and warehouse financing, as well as\ncorrespondent mortgage banking, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such,\nwe strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and\nretaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior\nservice to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the\nactions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results and the value of our stock may\nbe materially adversely affected.\nCredit and Financial Risks\nA decline in general business and economic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States,\ngenerally, and particularly Indiana. If the national, regional or local economies experience worsening economic\nconditions, including high levels of unemployment, our growth and profitability could be constrained. Additionally, our\nability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers is made more complex by uncertain business and economic\nconditions. Weak economic conditions are characterized by, among other indicators, deflation, elevated levels of\nunemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on mortgage, commercial and\nconsumer loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines, increases in nonperforming assets and\n19\nforeclosures, lower home sales and commercial activity, and fluctuations in the multi-family FHA financing sector.\nAdditionally, 2022 and 2023 had elevated levels of inflation and interest rates; if these conditions persist, it could also\ncause increased volatility and uncertainty in the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and\nour clients’ ability to repay indebtedness. All of these factors are generally detrimental to our business. Our business is\nsignificantly affected by monetary and other regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and\ngovernment-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other\nfactors that are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we do not effectively manage our credit risk, we may experience increased levels of delinquencies, nonperforming\nloans and charge-offs, which could require increases in our provision for credit losses.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks\nof nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service\ndebt and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. We cannot guarantee that our credit\nunderwriting, credit monitoring, and risk management procedures will adequately reduce these credit risks, and they\ncannot be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks. If the overall economic climate in the United States,\ngenerally, or our market areas, specifically, declines, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans,\nand the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the\nprovision for credit losses, which would cause our net income, return on equity and capital to decrease.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on\nnonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity,\nincreasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in\nforeclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may\nresult in a loss. These nonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the level of\ncapital our regulators believe is appropriate for us to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming\nassets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other\nresponsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, our net interest income\nmay be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect\non our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\nOur allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACL-Loans”) may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our\nloan portfolio.\nThe Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"CECL\") on January 1, 2022. CECL\nreplaces the previous “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” standard for measuring credit losses. We establish our\nACL-Loans and maintain it at a level that management considers adequate to absorb probable loan losses based on an\nanalysis of our portfolio, the underlying health of our borrowers, and general economic conditions. The ACL-Loans\nrepresents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant\ninformation available to us. The ACL-Loans and maintain it at a level that management considers adequate to absorb\nprobable loan losses based on an analysis contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to\nspecific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are\nnot specifically identified. Additions to the ACL-Loans, which are charged to earnings through the provision for credit\nlosses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience\nand an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market areas. The determination of the appropriate level of the\nACL-Loans is inherently subjective and requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding current\ncredit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by\nchanges in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, which may be beyond our control, and such\nlosses may exceed current estimates.\nAlthough management believes that the ACL-Loans is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may\nbecome uncollectible, we may be required to take additional provisions for credit losses in the future to further\n20\nsupplement the ACL-Loans, either due to management’s decision to do so or because our banking regulators require us\nto do so. Our bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our ACL-Loans and the value attributed to nonaccrual\nloans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure and may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these\nitems. These adjustments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe small to midsized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments,\nwhich may impair a borrower’s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe serve the banking and financial service needs of small to midsized businesses. These businesses generally\nhave fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller\nmarket shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional\ncapital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a\nborrower’s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the\nmanagement talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation\nof one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If\ngeneral economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses\nare adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may\nrely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and\nother financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and\ncompleteness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers’ representations\nthat their financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on\ncustomer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants’ reports, with respect to the business and\nfinancial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could\nbe negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nIf the goodwill that we have recorded or may record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it\ncould require charges to earnings.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets we\nacquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. We review goodwill for impairment at least\nannually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be\nimpaired.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an\nimpairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of\noperations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2023, our goodwill totaled $15.8 million.\nWhile we have not recorded any impairment charges since we initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance\nthat our future evaluations of our existing goodwill or goodwill we may acquire in the future will not result in findings of\nimpairment and related write-downs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOn January 26, 2024, the Company sold its Farmers-Merchants Bank of Illinois branches to Bank of Pontiac\nand CBI Bank &Trust and merged its banking charter into Merchants Bank. The transaction included the extinguishment\nof $7.8 million in goodwill.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern\nthe preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting\nand reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or\n21\noutside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes\nmay be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial\ncondition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard\nretrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to\nrevise or restate prior period financial statements.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\nwhich require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an\nannual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting.\nIf we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply\nwith the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is\neffective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting, investors, counterparties and customers may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports; our liquidity, access to capital markets and\nperceptions of our creditworthiness could be adversely affected; and the market price of our common stock could\ndecline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed,\nthe SEC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, IDFI, IDFPR, CFPB or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional\nfinancial and management resources. These events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or\nestimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make\njudgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report, describe those significant\naccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider\n“critical” because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or regulatory views concerning such analysis differ\nsignificantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or\nassumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, in each case\nresulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements, cause damage to our reputation and the\nprice of our common stock, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDowngrades to the credit rating of the U.S. government or of its securities or any of its agencies by one or more of the\ncredit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions, as well as our business.\nDowngrades of the U.S. federal government’s sovereign credit rating, and the perceived creditworthiness of\nU.S. government-backed obligations, could affect our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected\ninstruments and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Such downgrades could also affect the pricing\nof funding, when funding is available. A downgrade of the credit rating of the U.S. government, or of its agencies or\nrelated institutions or instrumentalities, may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments and, further,\nexacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nDowngrades to the credit rating of the Company or its subsidiaries by one or more of the credit rating agencies could\nhave a material adverse effect on the cost of or our ability to raise additional capital for future growth.\nDowngrades of the Company’s credit rating, and its perceived creditworthiness, could affect our ability to\nborrow funds and/or access capital markets on favorable terms. Such downgrades could adversely affect the future\nborrowings or capital raised, including substantially raising the costs and could cause creditors and business\ncounterparties to raise collateral requirements. A downgrade of the credit rating may also adversely affect the market\n22\nvalue of such instruments and, further, exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects\non our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Downgrades could result from general industry-wide or\nregulatory factors not solely related to the Company, including conditions and factors caused by events that the\nCompany has little or no control over.\nOperational Risks\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to\nmanage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and\ncompliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management\nassumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not\nadequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We\nmay also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe are highly dependent on our management team, and the loss of our senior executive officers or other key\nemployees could harm our ability to implement our strategic plan, impair our relationships with customers and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur success is dependent, to a large degree, upon the continued service and skills of our executive management\nteam, particularly Michael Petrie, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Dunlap, our President and\nChief Operating Officer. Mr. Dunlap also serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President of Merchants Bank and\nChairman of MCC.\nOur business and growth strategies are built primarily upon our ability to retain employees with experience and\nbusiness relationships within their respective market areas. We seek to manage the continuity of our executive\nmanagement team through regular succession planning. As part of such succession planning, other executives and high\nperforming individuals have been identified and are provided certain training in order to be prepared to assume particular\nmanagement roles and responsibilities in the event of the departure of a member of our executive management team.\nHowever, the loss of Mr. Petrie or Mr. Dunlap, or any of our other key personnel could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness and growth because of their skills, years of industry experience, and knowledge of our market areas, our failure\nto develop and implement a viable succession plan, the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel, or any\ndifficulties associated with transitioning of responsibilities to any new members of the executive management team.\nWhile our executive officers (except for Mr. Petrie) are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation provisions as\npart of change in control agreements entered into with them and our mortgage originators and loan officers are generally\nsubject to non-solicitation provisions as part of their employment, our ability to enforce such agreements may not fully\nmitigate the injury to our business from the breach of such agreements, as such employees could leave us and\nimmediately begin soliciting our customers. The departure of any of our personnel who are not subject to enforceable\nnon-competition and/or non-solicitation agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nOur management depends on the use of data and modeling in decision-making, and faulty data or modeling\napproaches could negatively impact decision-making or possibly subject us to regulatory scrutiny in the future.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is endemic to bank\ndecision-making, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity\nstress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, allowance for credit losses computations, mortgage servicing rights\nvaluations, and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of areas in\nwhich we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is also\nbecoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While we are not currently subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act stress\ntesting (DFAST) and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submissions, we anticipate that\nmodel-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in the future. We anticipate data-based\nmodeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities\ndeveloped to meet rigorous stress testing requirements are able to be employed more widely and in differing\napplications. While we believe these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also\n23\ncreate the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact our decision-making\nability or, if we become subject to regulatory stress-testing in the future, adverse regulatory scrutiny. Secondarily,\nbecause of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly\nresult in suboptimal decision-making.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation\nand other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to hardware and cybersecurity\nissues. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire,\npower loss, telecommunications failure, or a similar catastrophic event. We could also experience a breach by intentional\nor negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal or external sources, including our third-party vendors.\nAny damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer\nsystems and network infrastructure utilized by us, including our internet banking activities, against damage from\nphysical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users. Such\ncomputer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through\nour computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability, damage our reputation and\ninhibit the use of our mobile and internet banking services by current and potential customers. We regularly add\nadditional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of\ncybersecurity breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing.\nThe Corporation maintains a comprehensive Information Security Program, which includes annual risk\nassessments, an Incident Response Plan, and a layered control environment meant to detect, prevent, and limit\nunauthorized or harmful actions across our information technology environment. However, it is difficult or impossible to\ndefend against every risk being posed by changing technologies as well as criminal intent on committing cyber-crime.\nIncreasing sophistication of criminal organizations and advanced persistent threats make keeping up with new threats\ndifficult and could result in a breach. Controls employed by our information technology department and cloud vendors\ncould prove inadequate. A breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a\ndisruption or challenges relating to our daily operations, as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties,\nsignificant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage, any of which could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdoption of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) may present significant challenges relating to compliance risk, credit risk,\nreputation risk, and operational risk.\nAdvances in computing capacity, combined with greater availability of data and improvements in analytical\ntechniques, continue to expand opportunities for banks to leverage AI for various risk management and operational\npurposes. AI use cases have varied widely and include customer chatbots, fraud detection, and credit scoring. Generative\nAI in particular has garnered significant attention recently, following the commercial availability of large language\nmodel tools that have made the use of generative AI more widely accessible.\nThe potential for further benefits and risks as AI gains more widespread adoption could be\nsignificant. Developments in the technology may reduce costs and increase efficiencies; improve products, services, and\nperformance; strengthen risk management and controls; and expand access to credit and other banking services. Many\nrisks can arise from all types of AI, such as lack of accountability and explainability, reliance on large volumes of data,\npotential bias, privacy concerns, third-party risk, cybersecurity risks, and consumer protection concerns.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services\nor fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically,\nwe receive core systems processing, mortgage servicing, online wire processing, mobile and online banking, essential\nweb hosting and other internet systems, deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service\nproviders. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to\nreplace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a\nsignificant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps\n24\nmaterially. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement\nnew technology or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new\ntechnology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology\nincreases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our\nability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy\ncustomer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow\nand expand our market area. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology\nenhancements, or seek to implement them across all of our offices and business units, which could result in us not fully\nrealizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such\nchallenges in a timely manner.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.\nAs a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would\nput us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, a risk exists that we will not be able to effectively implement new\ntechnology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures\nand errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and/or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory\nsanctions and seriously harm our reputation or financial performance. Misconduct by our employees could include, but\nis not limited to, hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers\nor improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the\nprecautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also\nsubject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks,\nincluding data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to\nprevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to overcome the integration and other risks associated with acquisitions, which could have an\nadverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy.\nAlthough we plan to continue to grow our business organically, we also intend to pursue acquisition\nopportunities that we believe complement our activities and have the ability to enhance our profitability and provide\nattractive risk-adjusted returns. Our future acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number\nof risks, including the following:\n• intense competition from other banking organizations and other acquirers for potential merger candidates;\n• market pricing for desirable acquisitions resulting in returns that are less attractive than we have\ntraditionally sought to achieve;\n• incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and\nnegotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our\nexisting business;\n• using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with\nrespect to the target institution or assets;\n• potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire, including\nconsumer compliance issues;\n25\n• the time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n• experiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations;\n• losing key employees and customers;\n• reputational issues if the target’s management does not align with our culture and values;\n• significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the target;\n• integration of acquired customers into our financial and customer product systems; or\n• regulatory timeframes for review of applications may limit the number and frequency of transactions we\nmay be able to consummate.\nDepending on the condition of any institution or assets or liabilities that we may acquire, that acquisition may,\nat least in the near term, adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated with our\norganization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. We may not be successful in overcoming these\nrisks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions, and any acquisition we\nmay consider will be subject to prior regulatory approval. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse\neffect on our ability to implement our business strategy, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nMarket, Interest Rate, and Liquidity Risks\nFluctuations in interest rates may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nNet interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the\ninterest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. When interest rates rise, the rate of interest we pay on our liabilities,\nsuch as deposits, could rise more quickly than the rate of interest that we receive on our interest-bearing assets, such as\nloans, which may cause our profits to decrease. The impact on earnings is more adverse when short-term interest rates\nincrease more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates,\nleading to similar yields between short-term and long-term rates. Many factors impact interest rates, including\ngovernmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply and international\neconomic weaknesses and disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the\npotential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by any\nreduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in\nprepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their mortgages and other indebtedness at lower rates.\nOur multi-family servicing rights assets typically have a ten year call protection, but as interest rates decrease,\nthe potential for prepayment increases and the fair market value of our servicing rights assets may decrease. Our ability\nto mitigate this decrease in value is largely dependent on our ability to refinance the loan and retain servicing rights.\nWhile we have previously been successful in our servicing retention, we may not be able to achieve the same level of\nretention in the future.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest\nrates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in\nnonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid\ninterest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is\nreflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in\nthe amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nRising interest rates will result in a decline in value of the fixed-rate debt securities we hold in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. The unrealized losses resulting from holding securities available for sale would be recognized in\nother comprehensive income (loss) and reduce total shareholders’ equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively impact our\n26\nregulatory capital ratios; however, tangible common equity and the associated ratios would be reduced. If debt securities\nin an unrealized loss position are sold, such losses become realized and will reduce our regulatory capital ratios.\nAlternatively, certain securities, for which a fair value option has been elected, will require the company to recognize\ngains or losses into income currently as there are changes in value.\nThe slope of the yield curve affects our net interest income and we could experience net interest margin\ncompression if our interest earning assets reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates fail to decline in\ntandem. This would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.\nNegative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral\nsecuring our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary\ncomponent of collateral. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could increase\nthe credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in\na short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes\naffecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk\nassociated with our loan portfolio, significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our\nability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses, which could result in losses that would\nadversely affect profitability. Such declines and losses would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations and growth prospects. In addition, if hazardous or toxic substances are found on properties pledged as\ncollateral, the value of the real estate could be impaired. If we foreclose on and take title to such properties, we may be\nliable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to\nincur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit\nour ability to use or sell the affected property.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans\nand/or investment securities and from other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. A source of\nour funds consists of our customer deposits, including escrow deposits held in connection with our multi-family\nmortgage servicing business. These deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to\ncertain factors that may be outside of our control, such as a loss of confidence by customers in us or the banking sector\ngenerally, customer perceptions of our financial health and general reputation, increasing competitive pressures from\nother financial services firms for consumer or corporate customer deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other\ninvestment classes. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively\nlow cost source of funds, which would require us to seek wholesale funding alternatives in order to continue to grow,\nthereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nA significant portion of our total deposits are concentrated in large mortgage non-depository financial\ninstitutions. These concentration levels expose us to the risk that one of these depositors will experience financial\ndifficulties, withdraw its deposits after providing Merchants Bank with any contractually required prior notice (typically\n180 days), or otherwise lose the ability to generate custodial funds due to business or regulatory realities. However, these\ninstitutions also have warehouse funding arrangements, providing us the opportunity to mitigate this risk by electing not\nto participate or fund an institution’s loans in the event such institution removes its deposits. Nonetheless, failure to\neffectively manage this risk and subsequent reduction in the deposits of our customers could have a material impact on\nour ability to fund lending commitments or increase cost of funds, thereby decreasing our revenues.\nAdditional liquidity is provided by brokered deposits and our ability to pledge and borrow from the FHLB and\nFederal Reserve. Brokered deposits may be more rate sensitive than other sources of funding. In the future, those\ndepositors may not replace their brokered deposits with us as they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest\nto keep those deposits or to replace them with other deposits or other sources of funds. Not being able to maintain or\nreplace those deposits as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, if Merchants Bank does not\nmaintain its well-capitalized position, it may not accept or renew any brokered deposits without a waiver granted by the\nFDIC. We also may borrow from third-party lenders from time to time. Our access to funding sources in amounts\nadequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that\n27\naffect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or\nnegative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAdditionally, as a BHC we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries as our primary source of income.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to certain legal and regulatory limitations on their ability to pay us dividends. Any reduction\nor limitation on our subsidiaries abilities to pay us dividends could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and in\nparticular, affect our ability to repay our borrowings.\nAny decline in available funding, including a decrease in brokered deposits, could adversely impact our ability\nto continue to implement our strategic plan, including our ability to originate loans, fund warehouse financing\ncommitments, meet our expenses, declare and pay dividends to our shareholders or to fulfill obligations such as repaying\nour borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our\nliquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we breach any of the representations or warranties we make to a purchaser of our mortgage loans, we may be\nliable to the purchaser for certain costs and damages.\nWhen we sell or securitize mortgage loans in the ordinary course of business, we are required to make certain\nrepresentations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated.\nUnder these agreements, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans if we have breached any of these\nrepresentations or warranties, in which case we may record a loss. In addition, if repurchase and indemnity demands\nincrease on loans that we sell from our portfolios, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be\nadversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through\ntransactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks,\ninvestment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more\nfinancial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and\ncould lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Additionally, if our competitors\nwere extending credit on terms we found to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believed did not warrant\nthe credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our business volume and could experience deteriorating financial\nperformance.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to\nlosses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations,\nability to grow, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. Although we raised\nsignificant funds through our October 2017 initial public offering and $362.1 million, net of expenses and repurchases,\nthrough several preferred stock offerings between 2019 and 2022, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to\nprovide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could\ninclude the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, we, on a consolidated basis, and Merchants Bank on a\nstand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly,\nregulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or\ncontract our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic\nconditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market\nconditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide\nassurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain\ncapital to meet regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially\nand adversely affected.\n28\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business,\ngovernance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on bank holding companies;\nchanged the base for the FDIC insurance assessments to a bank’s average consolidated total assets minus average\ntangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to\n$250,000; and expanded the FDIC’s authority to raise insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB\nas an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority\nover consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and\ncredit cards and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters, such as steering incentives, determinations as to a\nborrower’s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act are required for\ninstitutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as Merchants Bank.\nCompliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations has and will continue to result in\nadditional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, new proposals for legislation may be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further\nsubstantially increase regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and impose restrictions on the\noperations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which\nexisting regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws\napplicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require\nmore oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing,\nattract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs, including\nincreased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources\nto make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nNew regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage\nmarkets which we would utilize to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more\ndifficult to operate a residential and multi-family mortgage origination and servicing business.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements because we exceed $10 billion in assets.\nAt December 31, 2023 we had total assets of $17.0 billion. We expect to continue to exceed $10 billion in total\nassets in the future. Upon crossing that threshold, we became subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and expectations\nimposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with the standards imposed by our regulators because of such scrutiny and\nexpectations could increase our operational costs. Our regulators may also consider our compliance with their standards\nwhen examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make.\nPreviously, while Merchants Bank was subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, the FDIC was primarily\nresponsible for examining Merchants Bank’s compliance with consumer protection laws and the CFPB’s regulations.\nHowever, in 2023, after exceeding $10 billion in total assets for four consecutive quarters, Merchants Bank became\nsubject to direct examination of the CFPB. We cannot be certain how such direct examination will continue to impact us.\nAdditionally, institutions over $10 billion are also subject to limits on interchange fees paid by merchants when debit\ncards are used as payment. However, any such limitation would have a minimal effect on us because interchange fees are\nnot a material portion of our fee income.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements and failure to meet such requirements could limit our activities.\nThe Basel III regulatory capital reforms, or Basel III, not only increased most of the required minimum\nregulatory capital ratios, but also introduced a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the concept of a capital\nconservation buffer. Basel III also expanded the definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital\ninstruments must meet to be considered additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. In order to be a “well-capitalized”\ndepository institution under Basel III, an institution must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more;\n29\na Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a total capital ratio of 10% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Institutions\nmust also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital.\nThe failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators\nplacing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of\nnew activities, and could affect customer and investor confidence, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our\nability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations\nand financial conditions, generally.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the\npolicies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit\nconditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market\npurchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks’ reserve\nrequirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic\ngrowth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged\non loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating\nresults of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies\nupon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe Federal Reserve, FDIC, IDFI, IDFPR, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, RHS, and Ginnie Mae periodically\nexamine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking\nagency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management,\nliquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or\nregulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the\npower to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any\nviolation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital,\nto restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that\nsuch conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance\nand place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and\nfailure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations\nprohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking\nagencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A challenge to an\ninstitution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions and/or\ndirectives, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions\nactivity, restrictions on expansion, restrictions on entering new business lines, and to make certain community\ninvestments or other costly expenditures, such as opening new branch offices. Private parties may also challenge an\ninstitution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAdditionally, the CFPB was created to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection and has broad\nrulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with\nrespect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized\nto prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that\nare “unfair, deceptive, or abusive” in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product\nor service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rulemaking powers of the\nCFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial\nproducts or services. The CFPB may propose new rules on consumer financial products or services, which could have an\n30\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if any such rules limit our ability to provide\nsuch financial products or services. The Company currently has an approved CRA strategic plan.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money\nlaundering statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to\ninstitute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports\nand currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements.\nThe federal banking agencies and FinCEN are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of\nthose requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial\nservices providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service.\nWe are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nIf our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and\nregulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory\napprovals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing\ncould also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support Merchants Bank.\nA BHC is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit\nresources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the “source of strength” doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a\nBHC to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the BHC with engaging in unsafe and\nunsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times\nwhen the BHC may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise\ncapital. Any loans by a BHC to its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other\nindebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any\ncommitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank.\nMoreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment\nover the claims of the BHC’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any\nborrowing that must be done by us to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\nMerchants Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for\nmaintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws\nrequire banks to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and\npermitting customers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain\ncircumstances. They also impact a bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for\nmarketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, banks are required\nto implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical\nsafeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nTo combat the ever-present cyber risks, the Company maintains a comprehensive Information Security Program\n(“ISP”), which includes annual risk assessments, an Incident Response Plan, and a layered control environment meant to\n31\nprotect, detect, respond, and limit unauthorized or harmful actions across our information technology environment.\nStandards over information security are Board-approved and various types of control testing is conducted throughout the\nyear, by internal and external parties. Recommendations are implemented and reported to various committees. These\nsecurity and privacy policies and procedures, for the protection of personal and confidential information, are in effect\nacross all businesses and geographic locations. Board-approved policies are in place to effectively mitigate risks linked\nto third-party service providers, encompassing factors such as availability, confidentiality, and governance and\ncompliance.\nThe Company employes a defense and depth posture, designed to safeguard information, prevent unauthorized\naccess, detect, and respond to threats, and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The ISP\nestablishes controls across many domains including but not limited to: Information Security Governance, Inventory and\nControl of Enterprise Assets and Software, Data Protection, Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software,\nAccount and Access Control Management, Continuous Vulnerability Management, Audit Log Management, Email and\nWeb Browser Protections, Malware Defenses, Data Recovery, Network Infrastructure Management, Network\nMonitoring and Defense, Security Awareness and Skills Training, Service Provider Management, Application Software\nSecurity, Incident Response Management, and Penetration Testing.\nRecognizing people as a key component of an effective information security program, the Merchants\nInformation Security Program strives to enhance education and awareness at all levels of the Company. One critical\ncomponent of education and awareness is an internal cybersecurity committee, comprised of employees from all levels\nand departments, who act as embedded security representatives for their business units.\nHowever, it is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies as well\nas criminal intent on committing cyber-crime. Increasing sophistication of criminal organizations and advanced\npersistent threats make keeping up with new threats difficult and could result in a breach. Controls employed by our\ninformation technology department and cloud vendors could prove inadequate. A breach of our security that results in\nunauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations, as well as\nto data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage,\nany of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company\nhas set the conditions to quickly respond to a cyber incident, ensuring a resilient, digital environment.\nGovernance\nThe Board established an IT Committee to assist executive management and the Board of Directors of the Bank\nin fulfilling their oversight responsibilities related to information security. The IT committee membership includes senior\nmanagement from business units, as well as information security risk experts such as the Information Security Officer,\nexperts from Enterprise Risk Management, Internal Audit, and Information Technology Leaders. At the IT Committee\nmeetings, security-related policies and standards are reviewed and approved, annual risk assessment results and action\nplans are noted, annual penetration test reports shared, current security incidents discussed, emerging threats reported on,\nand relevant cyber risks and trends are presented. The IT Committee is responsible for governing the assessment and\ntreatment of cyber risks. The Committee reports its activities, key conclusions, and recommendations to the Board on a\nquarterly basis.\nThe Chief Administrative Officer is responsible for the appointment of the Information Security Officer. The\nInformation Security Officer serves as the focal point for the information security program and is responsible and\naccountable for its implementation and monitoring, and management of the Information Security team. The current\nInformation Security Officer has over a decade of experience in the cyber security field, including critical roles in\nsecurity operations, security governance, risk, and compliance, and cyber threat intelligence. They have multiple\nindustry leading certifications, including nine Global Information Assurance Certifications (“GIAC”), Certified\nInformation Systems Security Professional (“CISSP”) from the International Information System Security Certification\nConsortium (“ISC2”) and a Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity Policy and Compliance.\nThe Information Security Officer presents an Annual Information Security Review to the board which\nsummarizes the previous year’s threat landscape, risk assessment, service provider, and audit testing activities, results of\nsecurity incidents, information security program changes, and future strategies and recommendations.\n32\nItem 2. Properties.\nThe Company owns its headquarters building, which includes a Merchants Bank branch at 410 Monon Blvd. in\nCarmel, Indiana. Its headquarters is currently in the process of being expanded. Employees of all three of our segments\nhave operations in this location. There are also several other branches and small offices in Indiana and other states. We\nbelieve that our facilities are in good condition and are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nThere are no material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business\nwhich we operate.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNone.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities.\nOur common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “MBIN” on\nOctober 27, 2017. Prior to that date, there was no public market for our common stock. On March 1, 2024, the closing\nprice of our common stock was $42.57. As of March 1, 2024, there were 43,331,304 shares of our common stock\noutstanding and 32 shareholders of record. A substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are “street\nname” or beneficial holders, whose shares are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.\nDividend Policy\nIt has been our policy to pay quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock, and we intend to continue\npaying dividends. Our dividend policy and practice may change in the future, however, and our board of directors may\nchange or eliminate the payment of future dividends at its discretion, without notice to our shareholders. Any future\ndetermination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will depend on our results of operations, financial\ncondition, capital requirements, banking regulations, payment of dividends on our preferred stock, contractual\nrestrictions and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nDividend Restrictions\nUnder the terms of each class of our preferred stock, we are not permitted to declare or pay any dividends on\nour common stock unless the dividends have been declared and paid on the shares of all our classes of preferred stock\nfor the period since the last payment of dividends.\nAs a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the policies and enforcement powers of the Federal\nReserve. In addition, because we are a BHC, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, and\nprimarily Merchants Bank, to us as our principal source of funds to pay dividends in the future, if any, and to make other\npayments. Merchants Bank is also subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions on its ability to pay\ndividends and make other distributions and payments to us. See Part I, Item 1 - “Supervision and Regulation—\nMerchants Bank – Dividends.”\n33\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock from December\n31, 2018 through December 31, 2023. The graph compares our common stock with the Nasdaq Composite Index and the\nNasdaq Bank Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100.00 in our common stock and each index on December\n31, 2018 and reinvestment of all quarterly dividends.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction\nwith “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying\nnotes included elsewhere in this report.\nDiscussion and Analysis of the Company’s financial condition and the results of operations for the year ended December\n31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 is contained in Item 7 of Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2023.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and\nuncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our expectations. Actual results and the timing of\nevents may differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements due to a number of\nfactors, including those set forth under Item 1 - “ Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements,” Item 1A -\n“Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking\nstatements.\nFinancial Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\n• Net income of $279.2 million increased $59.5 million, or 27%, compared to December 31, 2022.\n• Diluted earnings per share of $5.64 increased 26% compared to December 31, 2022.\n• The $59.5 million, or 27%, increase in net income compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was\nprimarily driven by a $129.5 million, or 41% increase in net interest income that was partially offset by a $38.6\nmillion, or 28% increase in noninterest expense, a $22.9 million, or 133%, increase in provision for credit\nlosses, and an $11.3 million, or 9% decrease in noninterest income.\n• Total assets of $17.0 billion increased $4.3 billion, or 34%, compared to December 31, 2022.\n• As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion, or 36% of total assets, in unused borrowing capacity\nwith the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Discount window, based on available collateral,\ncompared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2022.\n• The Company’s most liquid assets are in unrestricted cash, short-term investments, including interest-bearing\ndemand deposits, mortgage loans in process of securitization, loans held for sale, and warehouse repurchase\nagreements included in loans receivable. Taken together, with unused borrowing capacity, these totaled $10.6\nbillion, or 62%, of the $17.0 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2023.\n• Loans receivable of $10.1 billion, net of allowance for credit losses on loans, increased $2.7 billion, or 36%,\ncompared to December 31, 2022.\n• Efficiency ratio of 31.03% increased 42 basis points compared to 30.61% at December 31, 2022.\n37\n• As of December 31, 2023, approximately 93% of the total net loans at Merchants Bank reprice within three\nmonths, which reduces the risk of market rate increases.\n• Tangible book value per common share of $27.40 increased 25% compared to $21.88 at December 31, 2022.\n• In March 2023, the Company issued and sold $158.1 million senior credit linked notes, due May 26, 2028. The\nnet proceeds of the offering were approximately $153.5 million and resulted in a reduction of risk-weighted\nassets, which have benefited regulatory capital ratios to support loan growth.\n• In August 2023, the Company completed a $303.6 million securitization of 11 multi-family mortgage loans\nthrough a Freddie Mac-sponsored Q-Series transaction.\n• Our LIHTC syndications business raised $483.7 million in equity, closing seven new multi-investor and\nproprietary funds during 2023. A total of $1.4 billion in equity has been raised since its inception in 2020.\n• In September 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Bank of Pontiac to sell its Farmers-Merchants\nBank of Illinois branch locations in Paxton, Melvin and Piper City, Illinois and an agreement with CBI Bank &\nTrust, to sell its Farmers-Merchants Bank of Illinois branch located in Joy, Illinois. The sale was completed in\nJanuary 2024.\n• The volume of warehouse loans funded during the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $33.0 billion, a\ndecrease of $193.9 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2022. This compared to the 29% industry\ndecrease in single-family residential loan volumes from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the same period\nin 2022, according to an estimate of industry volume by the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n• The total volume of loans originated and acquired through our multi-family business was $6.2 billion, a\ndecrease of $2.7 billion, or 30%, compared to $8.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Many of\nthese loans are bridge loans housed in our banking segment while borrowers await conversion to permanent\nfinancing. The volume of bridge loans was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion, or 49%, compared to $6.0\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The volume of loans originated and acquired for sale in the\nsecondary market increased by $162.4 million, or 9%, to $2.0 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nCompany and Business Segment Overview\nWe are a diversified bank holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana and registered under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956, as amended. We currently operate in multiple business segments, including Multi-family\nMortgage Banking that offers multi-family housing and healthcare facility financing and servicing, as well as syndicated\nlow-income housing tax credit and debt funds; Mortgage Warehousing that offers mortgage warehouse financing,\ncommercial loans, and deposit services; and Banking that offers portfolio lending for multi-family and healthcare facility\nloans, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, agricultural lending, Small Business Administration\n(“SBA”) lending, and traditional community banking.\nOur business consists primarily of funding fixed rate, low risk, multi-family, residential and SBA loans meeting\nunderwriting standards of government programs under an originate to sell model, and retaining adjustable rate loans as\nheld for investment to reduce interest rate risk. The gain on sale of these loans and servicing fees contribute to\nnoninterest income. The funding source is primarily from mortgage custodial, municipal, retail, commercial, and\nbrokered deposits, and short-term borrowing. We believe that the combination of net interest income and noninterest\nincome from the sale of low risk profile assets results in lower than industry charge-offs and a lower expense base which\nserves to maximize net income and higher than industry shareholder return.\nSee “Company Overview and Our Business Segments,” in Item 1 “Business”, “Operating Segment Analysis for\nthe Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022” in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and the Results of Operations”, and “Segment Information,” in Note 26: Segment Information for further\ninformation about our segments.\n38\nPrimary Factors We Use to Evaluate Our Business\nAs a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our\nfinancial condition. We evaluate the comparative levels and trends of the line items in our consolidated balance sheet\nand income statement as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios\nand financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance, and the financial condition and\nperformance of comparable financial institutions in our region.\nResults of operations\nIn addition to net income, the primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our results of operations include\nnet interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and return on average equity.\nNet interest income. Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest\nincome from interest (net of deferred origination fees received and costs paid, which are amortized over the expected life\nof the loans) and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans, investment securities, cash, and dividends on\nFHLB stock we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including\ninterest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the most significant contributor to our revenues and net\nincome. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (a) yields on our loans and other interest-earning\nassets; (b) duration on our loans, deposits, and borrowings; (c) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources;\n(d) our net interest margin; and (e) the regulatory risk weighting associated with the assets. Net interest margin is\ncalculated as the annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing\nsources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net\ninterest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources.\nChanges in market interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and interest we earn on interest-earning assets or\npay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders’ equity, usually have the largest impact on changes in our net interest\nspread, net interest margin and net interest income during a reporting period.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income consists of, among other things: (a) gain on sale of loans; (b) loan\nservicing fees; (c) fair value adjustments to the value of servicing rights; (d) mortgage warehouse fees; and\n(e) syndication and asset management fees; and (f) other noninterest income.\nGain on sale of loans includes placement and origination fees, capitalized servicing rights, trading gains and\nlosses, gains and losses on certain derivatives and other related income. Loan servicing fees are collected as payments\nare received for loans in the servicing portfolio and reduced by amortization on servicing rights. Fair value adjustments\nto the value of servicing rights are also included in noninterest income. Mortgage warehouse fees are accrued at the time\nof funding. Syndication fee income is recognized at the point in time when investor equity capital is obtained primarily\nto acquire qualifying investments in low-income housing tax credit projects for its funds. Related asset management fees\nfor syndicated low-income housing tax credit or debt funds are recognized over time. Other noninterest income includes\nthe recognition and changes in value to protective derivatives associated with certain investment securities.\nNoninterest expense. Noninterest expense includes, among other things: (a) salaries and employee benefits,\nincluding commissions; (b) loan origination and servicing expenses; (c) occupancy and equipment expense;\n(d) professional fees; (e) FDIC insurance expense; (f) technology expense; and (g) other general and administrative\nexpenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits includes commissions, other compensation, employee benefits and employer tax\nexpenses for our personnel.\nLoan origination and servicing expenses include third party processing for financing activities and loan-related\norigination expenses. Occupancy expense includes depreciation expense on our owned properties, lease expense on our\nleased properties and other occupancy-related expenses. Equipment expense includes furniture, fixtures and equipment\nrelated expenses. Professional fees include legal, accounting, consulting and other outsourcing arrangements. FDIC\ninsurance expense represents the assessments that we pay to the FDIC for deposit insurance. Technology expense\nincludes data processing fees paid to our third-party data processing system provider and other data service providers.\n39\nOther general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with servicing expense, advertising, marketing,\ntravel, meals, training, supplies, and postage, among other miscellaneous expenses.\nNoninterest expenses generally increase as we grow our business. Noninterest expenses have increased\nsignificantly over the past few years as we have grown organically, and as we have built out and modernized our\noperational infrastructure and implemented our plan to build an efficient, technology-driven mortgage banking operation\nwith significant operational capacity for growth.\nReturn on Average Equity. Return on average equity is the measure of annual net income divided by the value\nof our total shareholders’ equity, expressed as a percentage. It reflects how efficiently equity investments are turned into\nprofits. Changes in profitability and the ability to effectively manage levels of capital can influence this measure. The\nhigher the ratio, the more profitable our Company is.\nFinancial Condition\nThe primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition are asset levels, liquidity, capital\nand asset quality.\nAsset Levels. We manage our asset levels based upon forecasted closings or fundings within our business\nsegments to ensure we have the necessary liquidity and capital to meet the required regulatory capital ratios. Each\nsegment evaluates its funding needs by forecasting the fundings and sales of loans, communicating with customers on\ntheir projected funding needs, and reviewing its opportunities to add new customers.\nLiquidity. We manage our liquidity based upon factors that include: (a) our amount of custodial and brokered\ndeposits as a percentage of total deposits (b) the level of diversification of our funding sources (c) the allocation and\namount of our deposits among deposit types (d) the short-term funding sources used to fund assets (e) the amount of\nnon-deposit funding used to fund assets (f) the availability of unused funding sources; (g) off-balance sheet obligations;\n(h) the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without a material loss on the investment; (i) the amount of\ncash and cash equivalent; (j) the repricing characteristics of our assets; (k) maturity and duration of our assets when\ncompared to the repricing characteristics of our liabilities; (l) costs of available funding options; and (m) other factors.\nCapital. We manage our regulatory capital based upon factors that include: (a) the level and quality of capital\nand our overall financial condition; (b) risk weighting of our assets; (c) the trend and volume of problem assets; (d) the\ndollar amount of servicing rights as a percentage of capital; (e) the level and quality of earnings; (f) the risk exposures on\nour balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet exposures; and (g) other factors. In addition, we have continually\nincreased our capital through net income less dividends and equity issuances. Our regulatory capital ratios can be\ninfluenced by various factors including levels of delinquency on loans.\nAsset Quality. We manage the diversification and quality of our assets based upon factors that include: (a) the\nlevel, distribution, severity and trend of problem, classified, delinquent, nonaccrual, nonperforming and restructured\nassets; (b) the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACL-Loans”); (c) the diversification and quality of\nloan and investment portfolios; (d) the extent of counterparty risks; (e) credit risk concentrations; (f) the liquidity of our\nassets; and (g) other factors.\nRecent Developments and Material Trends\nEconomic and Interest Rate Environment. The results of our operations are highly dependent on economic\nconditions, mortgage volumes, and market interest rates. Residential mortgage volumes fluctuate based on market\ninterest rates, economic conditions, and the credit parameters set by government agencies, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie\nMac, and Ginnie Mae, and other market participants. Prior to May 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (“Federal Reserve”) continued to reduce interest rates, leading to historically low overnight interest rates in the\nrange of 0.0% to 0.25%, which was the lowest the rates had been since 2009. The overnight federal funds rate that the\nFederal Reserve uses to affect economic conditions affects the entire term structure of interest rates, so rates on longer\nterm debt (like mortgages) also moved lower. As inflation increased throughout 2022 and 2023, on the heels of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve responded by rapidly increasing interest rates to the highest levels seen since\nJanuary 2008, as the Federal funds rate steadily increased and stabilized to 5.33% as of December 31, 2023. According\n40\nto Federal Reserve data, thirty-year mortgage rates rose to over 7% during 2022 for the first time since 2002, and\nremained elevated until the end of 2023, when rates began to fall slightly below 7%.\nThe lower interest rates in 2020 contributed to the significant loan growth we experienced for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, particularly related to single family mortgage refinancing activity that increased net interest income\nand noninterest income in our Mortgage Warehousing segment. Growth moderated and declined during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 in this line of business as interest rates increased, and it may not resume until rates\nstabilize or decline in 2024. Supporting this expectation are industry forecasts from the Mortgage Bankers Association,\nwhich has forecasted a 22% increase in single-family residential mortgage volume, to $2.001 trillion for 2024, from\n$1.639 trillion in 2023, and an increase of 17%, to $2.339 trillion in 2025, followed by an increase to $2.436 trillion for\n2026. The higher rate environment has also slowed multi-family permanent, agency-eligible loan originations and sales\nto the secondary market.\nRegulatory Environment. We believe an important trend affecting community banks in the United States over\nthe foreseeable future will be related to heightened regulatory capital requirements, regulatory burdens generally, and\ninterest margin compression. We expect that troubled community banks will continue to face significant challenges\nwhen attempting to raise capital. We also believe that heightened regulatory capital requirements will make it more\ndifficult for even well-capitalized, healthy community banks to grow in their communities by taking advantage of\nopportunities in their markets that result as the economy improves. We believe these trends will favor community banks\nthat have sufficient capital, a diversified business model and a strong deposit franchise.\nAs described further in Item 1 - “Supervision and Regulation—Merchants Bank—Capital Requirements and\nBasel III” the federal regulators finalized and adopted rules regarding the community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) in\nNovember 2019. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elected to\nuse such measure, such institution or holding company was considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to\naverage total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeded a 9% threshold, subject to a limited two quarter grace\nperiod, during which the leverage ratio could not go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and would not\nbe required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. At September 30, 2022 the Company’s total assets exceeded\n$10 billion, off-balance sheets exposures exceeded 25% of total assets, and the allowable grace periods under the CBLR\nrules expired. Accordingly, the Company has been reporting fully phased-in Basel III risk-based capital ratios since\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans (“ACL-Loans”). One of our key operating objectives has been, and\ncontinues to be, maintenance of an appropriate level of ACL-Loans in our loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses\nrecorded in prior years was primarily due to growth in our loan portfolio, as our historical loss rates remained very low.\nAs we anticipate that our loan portfolio overall will continue to grow in 2024, we could expect the provision to increase,\nbut could also be influenced by any changes to problem loans in our portfolio or the loan type mix within the portfolio. It\ncould also be influenced by external market factors, such as interest rates and economic activity. Additional details are\nprovided in the ACL-Loans portion of the Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. Because there could be unforeseen future losses, the Company continues to monitor the situation and may need to\nadjust future expectations as developments occur.\nIssuance and Redemption of Preferred Stock. On September 27, 2022, the Company issued 5,200,000\ndepositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 8.25% Fixed Rate Reset Series D Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Preferred Stock, without par value (the “Series D Preferred Stock”), and with a liquidation preference of\n$1,000.00 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share). The aggregate gross offering proceeds for the shares\nissued by the Company was $130.0 million, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering\nexpenses of approximately $4.7 million paid to third parties, the Company received total net proceeds of $125.3 million.\nOn September 30, 2022, the Company issued an additional 500,000 depositary shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the\nunderwriters related to their exercise of an option to purchase additional shares under the associated underwriting\nagreement, resulting in an additional $12.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting $0.4 million in underwriting\ndiscounts.\nDuring 2024, dividends on the Company’s 7% Series A and 6% Series B Preferred Stock are scheduled to reset\nat higher rates in April 2024 and October 2024, respectively. At that time, we shall have the option to pay higher\ndividends, redeem the shares, or refinance them with another preferred offering. See “Capital Resources” section of\n“Liquidity”, later in this Item 7 for more information.\n41\nLoan Sales and Securitizations. Growth in the loan origination pipeline has prompted the Company to seek\nadditional avenues to effectively manage regulatory capital levels and reduce credit risk, in addition to issuing preferred\nstock. Accordingly, we have completed several loan sale and securitization transactions. In doing so, the Company has\nbeen able to effectively reduce its risk-weighted assets and maintain well-capitalized capital ratios. Also see Note 5:\nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. We expect to continue incurring increased noninterest expense\nattributable to general and administrative expenses related to building out and modernizing our operational\ninfrastructure, marketing, and other administrative expenses to execute our strategic initiatives, as well as expenses to\nhire additional personnel and other costs required to continue our growth. We also expect costs to increase with\nadditional regulatory compliance requirements.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nGeneral. Net income of $279.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $59.5 million, or\n27%, compared to net income of $219.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily\ndriven by a $129.5 million, or 41%, increase in net interest income. The increase was partially offset by a $38.6 million,\nor 28%, increase in noninterest expense, $22.9 million, or 133%, increase in provision for credit losses, and an $11.3\nmillion, or 9%, decrease in noninterest income.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income of $448.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased\n$129.5 million, or 41%, compared to $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 41% increase reflected\na $597.0 million, or 124%, increase in interest income from higher yields and average balances on loans and loans held\nfor sale, as well as higher average balances of securities held to maturity. These increases were partially offset by a\n$467.4 million, or 288%, increase in interest expense from higher interest rates and average balances of deposits, as well\nas higher rates on borrowings that were primarily related to the credit linked notes issued by the Company in March\n2023. The interest rate spread of 2.51% for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased 21 basis points compared to\n2.72% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur net interest margin increased nine basis points, to 3.06%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 from\n2.97% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest Income. Interest income of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased\n$597.0 million, or 124%, compared to $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was\nprimarily attributable to an increase in both higher average yields and average balances of loans and loans held for sale,\nas well as higher average balances in securities held to maturity. The higher yields were in response to higher interest\nrates set by the Federal Reserve.\nInterest income of $959.7 million for loans and loans held for sale increased $507.7 million, or 112%, during\n2023. The average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, during the year ended December 31, 2023 increased\n$3.1 billion, or 33%, to $12.4 billion compared to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield\non loans increased 288 basis points, to 7.73% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.85% for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The increase in average balances of loans and loans held for sale was primarily due to\nincreases in the healthcare, commercial lines of credit collateralize by mortgage servicing rights real estate and multi-\nfamily portfolios, but all loan portfolios contributed to the growth during the period. The increase in the average yield\nreflected a significant portion of our loan portfolio with adjustable rates that increased with market rates.\nInterest income of $70.0 million for securities held to maturity increased $57.6 million, or 465%, during 2023.\nThe average balance of securities held to maturity, during the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $820.0 million,\nto $1.1 billion compared to $277.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield on securities held\nto maturity increased 192 basis points, to 6.38 % for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.46% for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The increase in average balance of securities held to maturity was primarily related to held to\nmaturity securities acquired as part of loan securitizations that the Company originated.\nInterest income of $21.6 million on securities available for sale increased $18.8 million, or 670%, during 2023.\nThe average balance of securities available for sale increased $300.7 million, or 93%, to $623.7 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, from $323.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield increased 260\n42\nbasis points, to 3.47% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 0.87% for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The increase in average balances of securities available for sale was primarily associated with the acquisition of\ncertain securities from a warehouse customer that provide protective put options and interest rate floor derivatives to\nprevent losses in value.\nInterest income of $11.6 million on interest-earning deposits and other increased $7.6 million, or 187%, during\n2023. The average balance of interest-earning deposits and other decreased $321.1 million, or 57%, to $240.8 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, from $561.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield\nincreased 480 basis points, to 5.74% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 0.94% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nInterest income of $12.7 million for mortgage loans in process or securitization increased $4.2 million, or 50%,\nduring 2023. The average balance of mortgage loans in process of securitization increased $3.8 million, or 2%, to $257.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield\nincreased 160 basis points, to 4.91% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 3.31% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense of $629.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased\n$467.4 million, or 288%, compared to $162.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest expense on deposits increased $427.6 million, or 286%, to $577.2 million for the year ended December\n31, 2023 compared to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher\nrates on certificates of deposit, interest-bearing checking, and money market accounts, as well as higher average\nbalances on certificates of deposit. The higher rates on our deposits were in response to higher interest rates set by the\nFederal Reserve.\nInterest expense of $233.1 million for certificate of deposit accounts increased $201.9 million during 2023. The\naverage balance of certificates of deposit of $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $3.0 billion, or\n194%, compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average rate on certificates of deposit was\n5.08% for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was a 308 basis point increase compared to 2.00% for year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nInterest expense of $216.5 million for interest-bearing checking accounts increased $147.4 million during 2023.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts of $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023\nincreased $567.4 million, or 14%, compared to $4.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield of\ninterest-bearing checking accounts was 4.59% for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was a 293 basis point\nincrease compared to 1.66% for year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest expense of $126.4 million for money market accounts increased $77.6 million during 2023. The\naverage balance of money market accounts of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $153.8\nmillion, or 6%, compared to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield of money market\naccounts was 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was a 267 basis point increase compared to 1.84% for\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest expense on borrowings increased $39.9 million, or 316%, to $52.5 million for the year ended December\n31, 2023 from $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase reflected a 624 basis point increase in\nthe average cost of borrowings to 8.37%, compared to 2.13% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was\nprimarily related to the credit linked notes issued by the Company in 2023. Also contributing to the increase in interest\nexpense for borrowings was an increase of $33.1 million, or 6%, in the average balance of borrowings of $627.5 million\ncompared to $594.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIncluded in interest expense on borrowings, our warehouse structured financing agreements provide for\nadditional interest payments for a portion of the earnings generated. As a result, the cost of borrowings increased from a\nbase rate of 8.36% and 1.56%, to an effective rate of 8.37% and 2.13% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n43\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar\namount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total\ndollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income;\n(iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis.

We recorded a total provision for credit losses of $40.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, an increase of $22.9 million, compared to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe $40.2 million total provision for credit losses consisted of $37.5 million for the ACL-Loans and $2.7\nmillion for the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures (“ACL-OBCEs”).\nThe ACL-Loans was $71.8 million, or 0.70% of loans receivable at December 31, 2023, compared to $44.0\nmillion, or 0.59% of loans receivable at December 31, 2022. The higher ACL-Loans reflected increases associated with\nloan growth, changes in qualitative loss factors, and specific reserves. Additional details are provided in the ACL-Loans\nportion of the Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and in Note 1: Nature of Operations\nand Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income of $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased\n$11.3 million, or 9%, compared to $125.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily\ndue to lower gain on sale and loan servicing fees that were partially offset by higher syndication and asset management\nfees.\nGain on sale of loans of $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $16.0 million, or 25%,\ncompared to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in gain on sale of loans was associated\nwith a business mix shift in multi-family lending from volumes sold in the secondary market towards those maintained\non the balance sheet.\n45\nA summary of the gain on sale of loans for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is below:\nGain on Sa le of Loans\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nLoan Type:\nMulti-family $ 42,979 $ 56,819\nSingle-family 1,247 1,133\nSmall Business Administration (SBA) 3,957 6,198\nTotal $ 48,183 $ 64,150\nLoan servicing fees of $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $4.0 million, or 13%,\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Loan servicing fees included a $4.6 million positive adjustment to the\nfair value of servicing rights for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a $19.8 million positive adjustment to\nthe fair value of servicing rights for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in noninterest income was a $3.5 million increase in syndication and asset\nmanagement fees, which reached $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense of $174.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased\n$38.6 million, or 28%, compared to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due\nprimarily to a $19.1 million, or 21%, increase in salaries and employee benefits associated with higher commissions on\nhigher production volume and to support loan growth, as well as a $10.1 million, or 292% increase in FDIC deposit\ninsurance expenses. The efficiency ratio was at 31.03% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with 30.61%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIncome Taxes. Provision for income tax of $68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased\n$2.7 million, or 4%, compared to $71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease reflected tax\nbenefits of $12.2 million related to tax refunds receivable and changes to state apportionment calculations that were\npartially offset by taxes on higher pre-tax income.\nThe effective tax rate was 19.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 24.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nAsset Quality\nTotal nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and greater than 90 days late but still accruing) were $82.0 million, or\n0.80% of total loans, at December 31, 2023, compared to $26.7 million, or 0.36% of total loans, at December 31, 2022.\nThe increase in nonperforming loans compared to both periods was primarily due to six customers in our multi-family\nand healthcare portfolios.\nAs a percentage of nonperforming loans, the ACL-Loans was 87% at December 31, 2023 compared to 165% at\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease in percentage was due to an increase in nonperforming loans. The increase in\nnonperforming loans was primarily related to increases in the nonaccrual classification and have all been individually\nevaluated for impairment.\nTotal loans greater than 30 days past due were $183.5 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $39.8 million\nat December 31, 2022. Since the majority of loans to customers have variable rates, the rapid increase in interest rates\nover the last several quarters negatively impacted borrowers by increasing their required payment amounts.\nSpecial Mention loans were $191.3 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $137.8 million in Special Mention\n(Watch) loans at December 31, 2022. While these categories are not precisely comparable as described in Note 5: Loans\nand Allowance for Credit Losses, the increase was primarily due to the increase in interest rates for our borrowers.\n46\nSubstandard loans were $128.6 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $64.8 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe increase in substandard loans was primarily due to the increase in nonperforming loans described above.\nWe had $41,000 of recoveries and $9.8 million of charge offs primarily related to one customer, during the year\nended December 31, 2023, and $753,000 of recoveries and $1.3 million of charge offs during the year ended December\n31, 2022.\nOperating Segment Analysis for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe operate in three primary segments: Multi-Family Mortgage Banking, Mortgage Warehousing, and Banking,\nas discussed in “Our Business Segments” of Item 1 and Note 26: Segment Information. The reportable segments are\nconsistent with the internal reporting and evaluation of the principal lines of business of the Company.\nOur segment financial information was compiled utilizing the policies described in Note 1: Nature of\nOperations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 26: Segment Information, included elsewhere in\nthis report. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily\ncomparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management\nstructure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in future changes to previously reported segment\nfinancial data. Transactions between segments consist primarily of borrowed funds and overhead expense sharing.\nIntersegment interest expense is allocated to the Mortgage Warehousing and Banking segments based on Merchants\nBank’s cost of funds. The provision for credit losses is allocated based on information included in our ACL-Loans\nanalysis and specific loan data for each segment.\nOur segments diversify the net income of Merchants Bank and provide synergies across the segments. Strategic\nopportunities come from MCC and MCS, where loans are funded by the Banking segment and the Banking segment\nprovides Ginnie Mae custodial services to MCC and MCS. Low-income tax credit syndication and debt fund offerings\ncomplement the lending activities of new and existing multi-family mortgage customers. The securities available for sale\nand held to maturity funded by MCC custodial deposits or purchases of securitized loans originated by MCC are pledged\nto FHLB to provide advance capacity during periods of high residential loan volume for Mortgage Warehousing.\nMortgage Warehousing provides leads to Correspondent Residential Lending in the Banking segment. Retail and\ncommercial customers provide cross selling opportunities within the banking segment. Merchants Mortgage is a risk\nmitigant to Mortgage Warehousing because it provides us with a ready platform to sell the underlying collateral to\nsecure repayment. These and other synergies form a part of our strategic plan.\nThe Other segment presented below, in Note 26: Segment Information, and elsewhere in this report includes\ngeneral and administrative expenses for provision of services to all segments, internal funds transfer pricing offsets\nresulting from allocations to or from the other segments, certain elimination entries, and investments in low-income\nhousing tax credit limited partnerships or Limited Liability Companies (“LLC”).\n47\nThe following table presents our primary operating results for our operating segments for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nM ulti-family\nMortgage Mortgage\n(Dollars in thousands) Banking Warehousing Banking Other Total\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nInterest income $ 5,718 $ 276,366 $ 789,399 $ 6,315 $ 1,077,798\nInterest expense 52 184,486 451,952 (6,763) 629,727\nNet interest income 5,666 91,880 337,447 13,078 448,071\nProvision for credit losses — 2,782 37,449 — 40,231\nNet interest income after provision for\ncredit losses 5,666 89,098 299,998 13,078 407,840\nNoninterest income 123,980 14,315 (12,527) (11,100) 114,668\nNoninterest expense 83,862 14,003 42,811 33,925 174,601\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 45,784 89,410 244,660 (31,947) 347,907\nIncome taxes 9,311 15,885 50,262 (6,785) 68,673\nNet income (loss) $ 36,473 $ 73,525 $ 194,398 $ (25,162) $ 279,234\nTotal assets $ 411,097 $ 4,522,175 $ 11,760,943 $ 258,301 $ 16,952,516\nM ulti-family\nMortgage Mortgage\n(Dollars in thousands) Banking Warehousing Banking Other Total\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nInterest income $ 2,239 $ 115,870 $ 354,482 $ 8,242 $ 480,833\nInterest expense — 48,079 117,284 (3,081) 162,282\nNet interest income 2,239 67,791 237,198 11,323 318,551\nProvision for credit losses 1,153 37 16,105 — 17,295\nNet interest income after provision for credit\nlosses 1,086 67,754 221,093 11,323 301,256\nNoninterest income 155,883 5,400 (26,177) (9,170) 125,936\nNoninterest expense 82,213 10,420 18,303 25,114 136,050\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 74,756 62,734 176,613 (22,961) 291,142\nIncome taxes 20,114 14,130 42,392 (5,215) 71,421\nNet income (loss) $ 54,642 $ 48,604 $ 134,221 $ (17,746) $ 219,721\nTotal assets $ 351,274 $ 2,519,810 $ 9,587,544 $ 156,599 $ 12,615,227\nMulti-family Mortgage Banking. The Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of\n$36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $18.2 million, or 33%, compared to $54.6 million\nreported for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decline was primarily due to lower noninterest income that was\npartially offset by a lower provision for income taxes.\nA $31.9 million decrease in noninterest income reflected a $34.4 million decrease in gain on sale of loans, as\nsales to the secondary market declined, and a $4.9 million decrease in other noninterest income. This was partially offset\nby a $3.4 million increase in loan servicing fees and a $4.0 million increase in syndication and asset management fees.\nLoan servicing fees reflected a positive fair market value adjustment of $3.9 million on servicing rights for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 compared to a positive fair market value adjustment of $14.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nA $10.8 million decrease in provision for income tax expense reflected a tax benefit related to tax refunds\nreceivable and changes to state tax apportionment calculations, as well as lower pre-tax income.\nThe total volume of loans originated and acquired through our multi-family business was $6.2 billion for the year\nended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.7 billion, or 30%, compared to $8.9 billion for the year ended December 31,\n2022. Loans originated include bridge loans housed in our banking segment while borrowers await conversion to\n48\npermanent financing. The volume of bridge loans was $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of\n$3.0 billion, or 49%, compared to $6.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The volume of loans originated\nand acquired for sale in the secondary market increased by $162.4 million, or 9%, to $2.0 billion, compared to $1.8\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nTotal assets in the Multi-family segment increased 17%, to $411.1 million at December 31, 2023, compared to\n$351.3 million at December 31, 2022.\nMortgage Warehousing. The Mortgage Warehousing segment reported net income of $73.5 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $24.9 million, or 51%, compared to $48.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The higher net income reflected higher interest income and mortgage warehouse fees even as\nindustry volumes declined.\nThe volume of loans funded during the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $33.0 billion, a decrease of\n$193.9 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2022. This compared to the 29% industry decrease in single-\nfamily residential loan volumes from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022,\naccording to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nTotal assets in the Mortgage Warehousing segment increased 79%, to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022.\nBanking. The Banking segment reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2023, of $194.4 million,\nan increase of $60.2 million, or 45%, compared to $134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase\nwas primarily due to a $100.2 million increase in net interest income due to higher balances in multifamily and\nhealthcare bridge loans and a $13.6 million increase in noninterest income. These were partially offset by a $24.5 million\nincrease in noninterest expense, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits that reflected higher\ncommissions on higher production volume, as well as increases in deposit insurance expense.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a positive fair market value adjustment of\n$688,000 on single-family servicing rights compared to a positive fair market value adjustment of $5.8 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nTotal assets in the Banking segment increased 23%, to $11.8 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $9.6\nbillion at December 31, 2022.\nSee “Our Business Segments,” in Item 1 “Business”, and Note 26: Segment Information, for further\ninformation about our segments.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $17.0 billion in total assets, $14.1 billion in deposits, and $1.7\nbillion in total shareholders’ equity. Total assets as of December 31, 2023 included approximately $584.4 million of cash\nand cash equivalents, $3.1 billion of loans held for sale and $10.1 billion of loans receivable, net of ACL-Loans. Total\nassets also included $110.6 million of mortgage loans in process of securitization that represent pre-sold multi-family\nrental real estate loan originations in primarily Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities\npending settlements that typically occur within 30 days. There were also $1.2 billion of securities held to maturity that\nwere primarily acquired in conjunction with the securitization of loans that the Company originated. Additionally, we\nhad $1.1 billion in securities available for sale, the majority of which were acquired from a warehouse customer, and\nothers are typically match funded with related custodial deposits or required to collateralize our credit-linked notes.\nThere are some restrictions on the types of securities we hold, particularly for those that are funded by certain multi-\nfamily custodial deposits where we set the cost of deposits based on the yield of the related securities. Servicing rights at\nDecember 31, 2023 were $158.5 million based on the fair value of the loan servicing, which includes Ginnie Mae multi-\nfamily servicing rights with 10-year call protection. The $306.4 million in other assets includes $161.3 million of low\nincome housing tax credit investments.\n49\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and 2022\nTotal Assets. Total assets of $17.0 billion at December 31, 2023 increased $4.3 billion, or 34%, compared to\n$12.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was due primarily to significant growth in the multi-family, healthcare,\ncommercial lines of credit collateralized by mortgage servicing rights, and mortgage warehouse loan portfolios.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents of $584.4 million at December 31, 2023 increased\n$358.3 million, or 158%, compared to December 31, 2022. The 158% increase reflected higher liquidity to fund\nanticipated loan growth. Included in cash equivalents was $36.4 million in restricted cash associated with the March\n2023 issuance of senior credit linked notes described in Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies and Note 14: Borrowings.\nMortgage Loans in Process of Securitization. Mortgage loans in process of securitization of $110.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 decreased $43.6 million, or 28%, compared to $154.2 million at December 31, 2022. These\nrepresent loans that our banking subsidiary, Merchants Bank, has funded and are held pending settlement, primarily as\nGinnie Mae or other agency mortgage-backed securities with a firm investor commitment to purchase the securities. The\n28% decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of loans that had not yet settled with government agencies.\nSecurities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2023 increased\n$790.4 million, or 244%, compared to $323.3 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in available for sale securities\nwas primarily due to purchases of $1.3 billion, partially offset by calls, maturities, repayments, sales and other\nadjustments of $501.5 million during the period. The purchases were primarily acquired from a warehouse customer,\nwhich provided put option and interest rate floor protections against any loss in fair value.\nIncluded in securities available for sale were $722.5 million of investment for which a fair value option was\nelected. Fair value option securities represent securities which the Company has elected to carry at fair value and are\nseparately identified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings as they\noccur.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses (“AOCL”) of $2.5 million, related to\nsecurities available for sale, decreased $8.0 million, or 76%, compared to losses of $10.5 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe $2.5 million of AOCL losses as of December 31, 2023 represented less than 1% of total equity and less than 1% of\ntotal securities available for sale.\nSecurities Held to Maturity. Held to maturity securities of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023 increased 8%\ncompared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to purchases of $293.3 million offset by\ncalls, maturities and repayments of securities totaling $208.1 million during the period.\n50\nThe following table shows the maturity distribution and weighted average yields of the securities available for\nsale and held to maturity portfolio:\nDue after one D ue afte r five\nbut within five but within ten Due after ten\nDecember 31, 2023 Due within one year years years years\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes $ 123,226 4.70 % $ 5,742 3.68 % $ — — % $ — — %\nFederal agencies 182,179 1.09 % 65,576 5.61 % — — % — — %\nMortgage-backed - Government\nAgency (\"Agency\") (1) — — % — — % 39 4.11 % 14,428 3.84 %\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency\nresidential - fair value option — — % — — % — — % 485,500 4.50 %\nMortgage-backed - Agency - fair\nvalue option — — % — — % — — % 236,997 4.49 %\nTotal securities available for sale $ 305,405 2.55 % $ 71,318 5.45 % $ 39 4.11 % $ 736,925 4.48 %\nSecurities held to maturity:\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency\nmulti-family $ — — % $ 719,662 6.24 % $ — — % $ — — %\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency\nresidential — — % — — % — — % 472,539 6.83 %\nMortgage-backed - Agency — — % — — % — — % 12,016 3.80 %\nTotal securities held to maturity $ — — % $ 719,662 6.24 % $ — — % $ 484,555 6.75 %\n(1) Agency includes government sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginne Mae.\n51\nLoans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale of $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023 increased $234.2 million, or 8%,\ncompared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in loans held for sale was due primarily to an increase in\nwarehouse participations, partially offset by loans associated with credit linked notes that were transferred to loans\nreceivable during 2023. Loans held for sale are comprised primarily of single-family residential real estate loan\nparticipations that meet Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae eligibility. It also includes a growing portfolio of\nmulti-family loans.\nLoans Receivable, Net.

The increase was comprised primarily\nof:\n• an increase of $870.6 million, or 28%, in multi-family financing loans, to $4.0 billion at December 31,\n2023,\n• an increase of $752.3 million, or 47%, in healthcare financing loans, to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023,\n• an increase of $664.4 million, or 68%, in commercial and commercial real estate loans, to $1.6 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023,\n• an increase of $287.7 million, or 62%, in mortgage warehouse lines of credit, to $752.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, and\n• an increase of $145.9 million, or 12%, in residential real estate loans, to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe $870.6 million increase in multi-family financing loan balances was primarily in the construction and\nbridge portfolios that were generated through our multi-family segment and will remain on our balance sheet until they\nconvert to permanent financing or are otherwise paid off over the next one to three years. Although overall production\nvolumes have declined compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, loan balances have increased as\nborrowers have been hesitant to convert to permanent financing at recently elevated interest rate levels, which has\nslowed loan sales to the secondary market.\n52\nThe $752.3 million increase in healthcare financing was due to increased volume associated with the credit link\nnotes transaction where loans were transferred from loans held for sale during the first quarter of 2023.\nThe $664.4 million increase in commercial and commercial real estate was primarily due to higher revolving\nlines of credit on collateralized mortgage servicing rights during the period.\nThe $287.7 million increase in mortgage warehouse lines of credit was due to higher loan volume from\nincreased sales efforts and market exits of several competitors.\nThe $145.9 million increase in residential real estate loans was primarily due an increase in All-in-One first-lien\nhome equity line of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 93% of the total net loans at Merchants Bank reprice within three\nmonths, which reduces the risk of market rate increases.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans (“ACL-Loans”).

The increase was primarily in the healthcare and multi-family financing portfolios, due to a\ncombination of loan growth, changes in qualitative factors, and specific reserves.\nAlso influencing the overall level of the ACL-Loans is our differentiated strategy to typically hold loans with\nshorter durations and to maintain strict underwriting standards that enable us to sell the majority of our loans to\ngovernment agencies.\nPremises and Equipment, Net. Premises and equipment, net, of $42.3 million at December 31, 2023 increased\n$6.9 million, or 19%, compared to $35.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in\nland acquired to expand our headquarters and to support business growth.\nGoodwill. Goodwill of $15.8 million at December 31, 2023 remained unchanged compared to December 31,\n2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s market capitalization was well above its book value, despite stock\n55\nmarket volatility. Given the continued strength of the Company’s results, we do not believe there exists any impairment\nto goodwill or intangible assets.\nServicing Rights. Servicing rights of $158.5 million at December 31, 2023 increased $12.2 million, or 8%,\ncompared to December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, originated and purchased servicing of\n$15.3 million and a positive fair market value adjustment of $4.6 million were partially offset by paydowns of $7.6\nmillion.\nServicing rights are recognized in connection with sales of loans when we retain servicing of the sold loans, as\nwell as upon purchases of loan servicing portfolios. The servicing rights are recorded and carried at fair value. The fair\nvalue increase recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023 was driven by higher loan balances of mortgages\nserviced and higher interest rates that impacted fair market value adjustments. The value of servicing rights generally\nincreases in rising interest rate environments and declines in falling interest rate environments due to expected\nprepayments and the value of custodial deposits. A significant portion of our servicing rights are for Ginnie Mae multi-\nfamily loans with 10-year call protection.\nOther Assets and Receivables. Other assets and receivables of $306.4 million at December 31, 2023 increased\n$148.9 million, or 95%, compared to $157.4 million at December 31, 2022. The 95% increase in other assets and\nreceivables was primarily due to investments in low-income housing tax credit funds and investments in joint ventures\nthat are involved in single-family, multi-family, and healthcare debt financing. Also contributing to the increase were\nprotective derivatives associated with the acquisition of certain investment securities from a warehouse customer, in\naddition to higher valuations on derivatives. See Note 11: Other Assets and Receivables for additional information.\nDeposits. Deposits of $14.1 billion at December 31, 2023 increased $4.0 billion, or 40%, compared to\n$10.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The 40% increase in total deposits was primarily due to a $2.2 billion increase in\ncertificates of deposit, primarily in brokered deposits, and a $1.9 billion increase in demand deposits. As of December\n31, 2023, approximately 89% of the total deposits at Merchants reprice within three months.\nUninsured deposits totaled approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, representing less than 20% of\ntotal deposits. Since 2018, the Company has offered its customers an opportunity to insure balances in excess of\n$250,000 through our insured cash sweep program that extends FDIC protection up to $100 million. The balance of\ndeposits in this program was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCore deposits increased by $782.2 million, or 11%, to $8.1 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to\nDecember 31, 2022. Core deposits represented 58% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 compared to 73% of total\ndeposits at December 31, 2022.\nWe increased our use of total brokered deposits by $3.2 billion, or 116%, to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2023\ncompared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Brokered deposits represented 42% of total deposits at December 31,\n2023, compared to 27% of total deposits at December 31, 2022.\n• Brokered certificates of deposit accounts increased $1.8 billion to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2023\nfrom $2.7 billion at December 31, 2022.\n• Brokered demand deposit accounts increased $1.5 billion, to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023 from\n$13,000 at December 31, 2022.\n• Brokered savings deposits decreased $81.0 million, to $589,000 at December 31, 2023 from\n$81.5 million at December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, brokered certificates of deposit had a weighted average remaining duration of 55\ndays. Although our brokered deposits are short-term in nature, they may be more rate sensitive compared to other\nsources of funding. In the future, those depositors may not replace their brokered deposits with us as they mature, or we\nmay have to pay a higher rate of interest to keep those deposits or to replace them with other deposits or other sources of\nfunds. Not being able to maintain or replace those deposits as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity.\nAdditionally, if Merchants Bank does not maintain its well-capitalized position, it may not accept or renew any brokered\ndeposits without a waiver granted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).\n56\nInterest-bearing deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 39%, to $13.5 billion at December 31, 2023, and noninterest-\nbearing deposits increased $193.2 million, or 59%, to $520.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe following tables show the average balance amounts and the average contractual rates paid on our deposits\nfor the periods indicated:\nFor the Year E nded For the Yea r E nded For the Yea r E nded\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Rate Balance Rate Balance Rate\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 337,723 — % $ 453,387 — % $ 678,494 — %\nInterest-bearing demand 4,717,300 4.59 % 4,149,942 1.66 % 4,589,269 0.14 %\nMoney market savings 2,805,284 4.51 % 2,651,532 1.84 % 2,264,063 0.77 %\nSavings 239,509 0.52 % 240,481 0.23 % 208,467 0.07 %\nCertificates of deposit 4,589,312 5.08 % 1,561,261 2.00 % 687,002 0.66 %\nTotal $ 12,689,128 4.55 % $ 9,056,603 1.65 % $ 8,427,295 0.34 %\nThe following table shows time deposits of $250,000 or more by time remaining until maturity:\nAt December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023\nThree months or less $ 70,573\nOver three months through six months 79,973\nOver six months through one year 154,558\nOver one year to three years 106,073\nOver three years —\nTotal $ 411,177\nBorrowings. Borrowings of $964.1 million at December 31, 2023 increased $33.7 million, or 4%, from\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of senior credit linked notes in March 2023 that was\npartially offset by decreased borrowing from the FHLB and Federal Reserve. Depending on rates and timing, borrowing\ncan be a more effective liquidity management alternative than utilizing brokered certificates of deposits. The Company\nutilizes borrowing facilities from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve’s discount window, and the American Financial\nExchange (“AFX”).\nThe Company continues to have significant borrowing capacity based on available collateral. As of December\n31, 2023, unused lines of credit totaled $6.0 billion, compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our borrowings at the dates and for the periods\nindicated:\nAt o r For the Yea rs\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at end of period $ 964,127 $ 930,392 $ 1,033,954\nAverage balance during period 627,516 594,423 657,573\nMaximum outstanding at any month end 1,654,075 1,440,904 1,103,443\nWeighted average interest rate at end of period(1) 7.51 % 4.06 % 0.27 %\nAverage interest rate during period 8.37 % 2.13 % 0.86 %\n(1) The weighted-average interest rate at the end of the period reflects the stated interest rates on the borrowings. In addition to\nthe stated rate, the borrowing term on subordinated debt includes payment of an amount equal to a portion of the net income\nfrom our warehouse structured finance arrangements, which is a driver of the higher average interest rate during the period\nrelative to the stated rate at end of period.\n57\nOther Liabilities. Other liabilities of $205.9 million at December 31, 2023 increased $71.8 million, or 54%,\ncompared to $134.1 million at December 31, 2022. The 54% increase in other liabilities was primarily due to interest\npayable, unfunded commitments for low-income housing credit investments, and a change in the valuation for back-to-\nback swap derivatives.\nTotal Shareholders’ Equity. Shareholders’ equity was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to $1.5\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. The $241.3 million, or 17%, increase resulted primarily from net income of $279.2\nmillion, which was partially offset by dividends paid on common and preferred shares of $48.5 million during the\nperiod.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of funds are business and consumer deposits, escrow and custodial deposits, brokered\ndeposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, and proceeds from sale of loans. While maturities and\nscheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly\ninfluenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.\nAt December 31, 2023, based on collateral, we had $6.0 billion in available unused borrowing capacity with the\nFHLB and the Federal Reserve discount window. This compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2022. While the\namounts available fluctuate daily, we also had available capacity lines through our membership in the AFX. This\nliquidity enhances the ability to effectively manage interest expense and asset levels in the future.\nThe Company’s most liquid assets are in cash, short-term investments, including interest-bearing demand\ndeposits, mortgage loans in process of securitization, loans held for sale, and warehouse repurchase agreements included\nin loans receivable. Taken together with its unused borrowing capacity of $6.0 billion described above, these totaled\n$10.6 billion, or 62%, of its $17.0 billion total assets at December 31, 2023. The levels of these assets are dependent on\nour operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur liquid assets and borrowing capacity significantly exceed our uninsured deposits. Uninsured deposits\ntotaled approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, representing less than 20% of total deposits. Since 2018, the\nCompany has offered its customers an opportunity to insure balances in excess of $250,000 through our insured cash\nsweep program that extends FDIC protection up to $100 million. The balance of deposits in this program was $1.6\nbillion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio has minimal levels of unrealized losses and management does not\nanticipate a need to sell securities for liquidity purposes at a loss. As of December 31, 2023, Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Losses (“AOCL”) of $2.5 million losses, related to securities available for sale, decreased $8.0 million,\nor 76%, compared to losses of $10.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The $2.5 million loss in AOCL as of December\n31, 2023 represented less than 1% of total equity and 1% of total securities available for sale.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing\nactivities, and financing activities. Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(356.4) million and $975.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash (used in) investing activities, which\nconsists primarily of net change in loans receivable and purchases, sales and maturities of investment securities and\nloans, was $(3.3) billion and $(2.9) billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash\nprovided by financing activities, which is comprised primarily of net change in deposits was $4.0 billion and $1.1 billion\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCertificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2023 totaled $5.0\nbillion, or 97%, of total certificates of deposit. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates\nof deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may decide to utilize\nFHLB advances, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract\nnew accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\n58\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to\nvarying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage\ncustomers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $4.0 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit that are subject to\ncredit risk and $3.7 billion in outstanding commitments subject to certain performance criteria and cancellation by the\nCompany, including loans pending closing, unfunded construction draws, and unfunded warehouse repurchase\nagreements. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments.\nAdditionally, the Company’s business model is designed to continuously sell a significant portion of its loans, which\nprovides flexibility in managing its liquidity.\nFor more information about our loan commitments, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, see\nNote 25: Commitments and Credit Risk.\nCapital Resources\nThe access to and cost of funding new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities,\nthe ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend,\nin part, on our capital position. The Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on August 8,\n2022, which was declared effective on August 17, 2022, under which we can issue up to $500 million aggregate offering\namount of registered securities to finance our growth objectives. As previously demonstrated, the Company also has the\nability to utilize securitization transactions to free up capital as needed.\nThe assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, earnings\nperformance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support\nour growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to our current operations and to promote public confidence in\nour Company.\nShareholders’ Equity. Shareholders’ equity was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to $1.5\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. The $241.3 million, or 17%, increase resulted primarily from net income of $279.2\nmillion, which was partially offset by dividends paid on common and preferred shares of $48.5 million during the\nperiod.\n7% Series A Preferred Stock. In March 2019 the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of 7.00% Fixed-to-Floating\nRate Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value, and with a liquidation preference of $25.00\nper share (“Series A Preferred Stock”). The Company received net proceeds of $48.3 million after underwriting\ndiscounts, commissions and direct offering expenses. In April 2019, the Company issued an additional 81,800 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock to the underwriters related to their exercise of an option to purchase additional shares under the\nassociated underwriting agreement, resulting in an addition $2.0 million in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable\nquarterly at an annual rate of $1.75 per share through March 31, 2024. After such date, quarterly dividends were to\naccrue and be payable at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 460.5 basis points per year.\nHowever, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock permit us to replace three-month LIBOR if we determine that\nLIBOR has been discontinued or is no longer viewed as an acceptable benchmark for similar securities. With the\ncessation of published three-month LIBOR rates as of June 30, 2023, the Company has determined that three-month\nLIBOR has been discontinued and is no longer an acceptable benchmark. The Company has replaced three-month\nLIBOR with Federal Reserve’s three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The Company believes that\nthree-month SOFR represents the most comparable replacement benchmark, is an industry-accepted substitute, and is\nconsistent with expectations of investors in securities similar to the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition to replacing\nthree-month LIBOR with three-month SOFR, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock permit us to adjust the spread to\nensure that the payable floating rate remains comparable. Therefore, if the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding\non or after April 1, 2024, in addition to using three-month SOFR as a benchmark, the Company will increase the spread\nby 26.2 basis points, which is consistent with industry practice and the recommendation of the Federal Reserve’s\n59\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee, resulting in the Company paying a floating rate of three-month SOFR plus a\nspread of 486.7 basis points during the floating rate period. The Company has received all necessary regulatory\napprovals to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock and on February 28, 2024 announced that it will redeem all\noutstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock on April 1, 2024 at a price equal to the liquidation preference of\n$25.00 per share. As of the redemption date the Series A Preferred Stock will not have any accrued but unpaid\ndividends. The Company will redeem the Series A Preferred Stock using cash on hand.\n6% Series B Preferred Stock. In August 2019 the Company issued 5,000,000 depositary shares, each\nrepresenting a 1/40th interest in a share of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred\nStock, without par value, and with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary\nshare)(“Series B Preferred Stock”). After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and direct offering expenses,\nthe Company received total net proceeds of $120.8 million.\nDividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable\nquarterly at an annual rate of $60.00 per share (equivalent to $1.50 per depositary share) through September 30, 2024.\nAfter such date, quarterly dividends were to accrue and be payable at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a\nspread of 456.9 basis points per year. However, the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock permit us to replace three-\nmonth LIBOR if we determine that LIBOR has been discontinued or is no longer viewed as an acceptable benchmark for\nsimilar securities. With the cessation of published three-month LIBOR rates as of June 30, 2023, the Company has\ndetermined that three-month LIBOR has been discontinued and is no longer an acceptable benchmark. The Company has\nreplaced three-month LIBOR with Federal Reserve’s three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The\nCompany believes that three-month SOFR represents the most comparable replacement benchmark, is an industry-\naccepted substitute, and is consistent with expectations of investors in securities similar to the Series B Preferred Stock.\nIn addition to replacing three-month LIBOR with three-month SOFR, the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock permit us\nto adjust the spread to ensure that the payable floating rate remains comparable. Therefore, if the Series B Preferred\nStock remains outstanding on or after October 1, 2024, in addition to using three-month SOFR as the benchmark, the\nCompany will increase the spread by 26.2 basis points, which is consistent with industry practice and the\nrecommendation of the Federal Reserve’s Alternative Reference Rates Committee, resulting in the Company paying a\nfloating rate of three-month SOFR plus a spread of 483.1 basis points during the floating rate period. The Company may\nalso redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at its option, subject to regulatory approval, on or after October 1, 2024.\n6% Series C Preferred Stock. On March 23, 2021, the Company issued 6,000,000 depositary shares, each\nrepresenting a 1/40th interest in a share of its 6.00% Fixed Rate Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,\nwithout par value (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), and with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share (equivalent\nto $25.00 per depositary share). The aggregate gross offering proceeds for the shares issued by the Company was $150.0\nmillion, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $5.1\nmillion paid to third parties, the Company received total net proceeds of $144.9 million.\nOn May 6, 2021, our 8% preferred shareholders participated in a private offering to replace their redeemed 8%\npreferred shares with the Company’s 6% Series C preferred stock. Accordingly, 46,181 shares (1,847,233 depositary\nshares) of the Company’s 6% Series C preferred stock were issued at a price of $25 per depositary share. The total\ncapital raised from the private offering was $46.2 million, net of $23,000 in expenses.\nDividends on the Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable\nquarterly. The Company may redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at our option, on any dividend\npayment date on or after April 1, 2026, subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at the\nliquidation preference, plus any declared and unpaid dividends (without regard to any undeclared dividends) to, but\nexcluding, the date of redemption.\n8.25% Series D Preferred Stock. On September 27, 2022, the Company issued 5,200,000 depositary shares,\neach representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 8.25% Fixed Rate Reset Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred\nStock, without par value (the “Series D Preferred Stock”), and with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share\n(equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share). The aggregate gross offering proceeds for the shares issued by the Company\nwas $130.0 million, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of\napproximately $4.6 million paid to third parties, the Company received total net proceeds of $125.4 million. On\nSeptember 30, 2022, the Company issued an additional 500,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the underwriters\n60\nrelated to their exercise of an option to purchase additional shares under the associated underwriting agreement, resulting\nin an additional $12.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting $0.4 million in underwriting discounts.\nDividends on the Series D Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable\nquarterly. The Company may redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at our option, on any dividend\npayment date on or after October 1, 2027, subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at the\nliquidation preference, plus any declared and unpaid dividends (without regard to any undeclared dividends) to, but\nexcluding, the date of redemption. If the Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding on October 1, 2027, its dividend\nrate would reset to the 5-year Treasury rate, plus 4.34% and would remain at that level for an additional 5 years.\nCommon Shares/Dividends. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 43,242,928 common shares issued\nand outstanding. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share in each quarter of 2023 and expects to raise\nits dividend in 2024.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported\namounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies.\nThe estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and\nour results of operations.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nACL-Loans. The Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2022. CECL replaces the previous “Allowance for\nLoan and Lease Losses” standard for measuring credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, the difference in the two\nmeasurements was recorded in the ACL-Loans and retained earnings.\nThe ACL-Loans is the Company’s estimate of current expected credit losses. Loans receivable is presented net\nof the allowance to reflect the principal balance expected to be collected over the contractual term of the loans. This life\nof loan allowance is established through a provision for credit losses charged to net interest income as loans are recorded\nin the financial statements. The provision for a reporting period also reflects increases or decreases in the allowance\nrelated to changes in credit loss expectations. Actual credit losses are charged against the allowance when management\nbelieves the uncollectability of a loan balance, or a portion thereof, is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are\ncredited to the allowance.\nThe ACL-Loans is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic\nreview of the collectability of the loans considering relevant available information from internal and external sources,\nincluding historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the\nborrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. The\nallowance also incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts. There have been no changes to the credit quality\ncomponents used to assess risk during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This evaluation is inherently\nsubjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The\nlevel of the ACL is believed to be adequate to absorb current expected future losses in the loan portfolio as of the\nmeasurement date.\nThe ACL-Loans consists of individually evaluated loans and pooled loan components. The Company’s primary\nportfolio segmentation is by segmenting loans with similar risk characteristics. Loans risk graded substandard and worse\nare individually evaluated for expected credit losses. For individually evaluated loans that are collateral dependent, the\nCompany may use the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, as a practical expedient as of the reporting\ndate to determine the carrying amount of an asset and the allowance for credit losses, as applicable. A loan is considered\nto be collateral dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or the sale of\nthe collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the reporting date.\nAdditional information regarding ACL-Loans estimates can be found in Note 1: Nature of Operations and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans.\nServicing Rights. Servicing assets are recognized separately when rights are acquired through purchase or\nthrough sale of financial assets. Servicing rights resulting from the sale or securitization of loans originated by us are\ninitially measured at fair value at the date of transfer. We have elected to initially and subsequently measure the\nservicing rights for mortgage loans using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, the servicing rights are\ncarried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which the\nchanges occur.\n63\nFair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or\nalternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.\nThe valuation model is from an independent third party and it incorporates assumptions that market participants would\nuse in estimating future net servicing cash flows, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial assets\nearnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, prepayment penalties, and default rates and losses.\nWe review the reasonableness of the assumptions and the methodology to ensure the estimated fair value complies with\naccounting standards generally accepted in the United States. These variables change from quarter to quarter as market\nconditions and projected interest rates change and may have an adverse impact on the value of the mortgage-servicing\nright and may result in a reduction to noninterest income.\nFair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the\ninstrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.\nWe estimate the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation\nmethods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used\nfor fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted\nprices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable\nmarket prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating\nthese factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at\neach level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by us can be found in Note 23: Disclosures About\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not adopted by us as\nof December 31, 2023, see Note 28: Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We\nincur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit\nspreads. We have identified two primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price risk related to market\ndemand.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOverview. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates.\nInterest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from\nembedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors’ ability to\nredeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates\nincrease or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different\nyield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries or SOFR.\nOur business consists primarily of funding fixed rate, low risk, multi-family, residential and SBA loans meeting\nunderwriting standards of government programs under an originate to sell model, and retaining adjustable rate loans as\nheld for investment to reduce interest rate risk.\nOur Asset-Liability Committee, or ALCO, is a management committee that manages our interest rate risk\nwithin broad policy limits established by our board of directors. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing\ninterest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Our ALCO meets quarterly to\nmonitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors’ approved risk limits.\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows\ncomplemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with\nunderstanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk\nposture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints.\n64\nAn asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is\nexpected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward\nmore quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a\nliability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected\nto generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly\nthan rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin.\nIncome Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to\nthe ALCO at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits\nexceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation,\nor assumption of the risk.\nWe use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk (NII at Risk) and Economic\nValue of Equity (“EVE”). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets,\nliabilities, and derivatives and excludes non-interest income. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus\nthe market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.\nWe report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities. The NII at Risk results reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models gradual\n−200, −100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over\nthe next one-year period.\nThe following table presents NII at Risk for Merchants Bank as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nN e t Interest In com e Sensitivity\nTwelve Months Forward\n- 200 - 100 + 100 + 200\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023:\nDollar change $ (73,311) $ (36,576) $ 29,601 $ 57,294\nPercent change (15.0) % (7.5) % 6.0 % 11.7 %\nDecember 31, 2022:\nDollar change $ (96,861) $ (48,581) $ 37,232 $ 74,094\nPercent change (23.8) % (11.9) % 9.2 % 18.2 %\nDecember 31, 2021:\nDollar change $ (13,810) $ (17,991) $ 21,895 $ 65,010\nPercent change (4.9) % (6.3) % 7.7 % 22.9 %\nOur interest rate risk management policy limits the change in our net interest income to 20% for a +/- 100 basis\npoint move in interest rates, and 30% for a +/- 200 basis point move in rates.

It models immediate −200, −100, +100, and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates.\nE conomic V alu e o f Equity\nSensitivity (Shock)\nImmediate Change in Rates\n- 200 - 100 + 100 + 200\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023:\nDollar change $ 180,864 $ 92,793 $ (34,800) $ (79,455)\nPercent change 10.8 % 5.5 % (2.1) % (4.7) %\nDecember 31, 2022:\nDollar change $ 22,855 $ 11,640 $ (10,925) $ (26,385)\nPercent change 1.6 % 0.8 % (0.8) % (1.9) %\nDecember 31, 2021:\nDollar change $ 3,703 $ 42,983 $ (6,817) $ (6,288)\nPercent change 0.3 % 4.0 % (0.6) % (0.6) %\nOur interest rate risk management policy limits the change in our EVE to 15% for a +/- 100 basis point move in\ninterest rates, and 20% for a +/- 200 basis point move in rates. We are within policy limits set by our board of directors\nfor the −200, −100, +100, and +200 basis point scenarios. The EVE reported at December 31, 2023 projects that as\ninterest rates increase (decrease) immediately, the economic value of equity position will be expected to decrease\n(increase). When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater\nthe value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall.\n66\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to\nabove present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit\nlosses effective January 1, 2022 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Topic 326: Financial Instruments – Credit\nLosses.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\ninclude examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\n68\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company’s loan portfolio totaled $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, and the associated allowance for\ncredit losses on loans was $71.8 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for credit losses (“ACL”) related to loans is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the\namortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the ACL represented\nmanagement’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering all relevant available information,\nfrom internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the\ninstrument.\nIn calculating the allowance for credit losses, loans were segmented into pools based upon similar risk\ncharacteristics. For each loan pool, management measured expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing\neither a remaining life or a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The remaining life method primarily utilized Company\nor peer group historical loss rates applied to the estimated remaining life of each pool. The DCF model primarily\nmeasures probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) with PD and LGD estimated by analyzing\ninternally sourced data or peer group data related to historical performance of each loan pool over a complete economic\ncycle. In some cases, management determined that an individual loan exhibited unique risk characteristics which\ndifferentiated the loan from other loans with the identified loan pools. In such cases, the loans were evaluated for\nexpected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. The models were adjusted to\nreflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the forecasted macroeconomic\nvariables were reverted to their historical mean utilizing a rational, systematic basis.\nManagement qualitatively adjusted model results for risk factors that were not considered within the modeling\nprocesses but were deemed relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools. These qualitative factor\nadjustments modified management’s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon\nthe estimated level of risk.\nWe identified the valuation of the ACL as a critical audit matter. Auditing management’s estimate of the ACL\ninvolved a high degree of subjectivity due to the nature of the qualitative factor adjustments included in the allowances\nfor credit losses and complexity of the remaining life and DCF models. Management’s identification and measurement\nof the qualitative factor adjustments is highly judgmental and could have a significant effect on the ACL.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed related to this CAM included:\n• Obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing the ACL, including the models and the\nqualitative factor adjustments of the ACL\n• Evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of related controls, including information system\ncontrols, over the reliability and accuracy of data used to calculate and estimate the various components of the\nACL including:\no Loan data completeness and accuracy\no Grouping of loans by segment and methodology selection\no Peer groups utilized\no Establishment of qualitative factors\n• Tested the completeness and accuracy, including the evaluation of the relevance and reliability, of inputs\nutilized in the calculation of the ACL\n69\n• Evaluated the qualitative adjustments to the ACL including assessing the basis for adjustments and the\nreasonableness of the significant assumptions\n• Evaluated credit quality trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, charge-offs and loan risk ratings\n• Evaluated the overall reasonableness of the ACL and evaluated trends identified within peer groups\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nFORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nMarch 12, 2024\n70\nMerchants Bancorp\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n(In thousands, except share data)\nDe cember 31, D ecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nCash and due from banks $ 15,592 $ 22,170\nInterest-earning demand accounts 568,830 203,994\nCash and cash equivalents 584,422 226,164\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell 3,349 3,464\nMortgage loans in process of securitization 110,599 154,194\nSecurities available for sale ($722,497 and $0 utilizing fair value option, respectively) 1,113,687 323,337\nSecurities held to maturity ($1,203,535 and $1,118,966 at fair value, respectively) 1,204,217 1,119,078\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock 48,578 39,130\nLoans held for sale (includes $86,663 and $82,192 at fair value, respectively) 3,144,756 2,910,576\nLoans receivable, net of allowance for credit losses on loans of $71,752 and $44,014,\nrespectively 10,127,801 7,426,858\nPremises and equipment, net 42,342 35,438\nServicing rights 158,457 146,248\nInterest receivable 91,346 56,262\nGoodwill 15,845 15,845\nIntangible assets, net 742 1,186\nOther assets and receivables 306,375 157,447\nTotal assets $ 16,952,516 $ 12,615,227\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity\nLiabilities\nDeposits\nNoninterest-bearing $ 520,070 $ 326,875\nInterest-bearing 13,541,390 9,744,470\nTotal deposits 14,061,460 10,071,345\nBorrowings 964,127 930,392\nDeferred tax liabilities 19,923 19,613\nOther liabilities 205,922 134,138\nTotal liabilities 15,251,432 11,155,488\nCommitments and Contingencies\nShareholders' Equity\nCommon stock, without par value\nAuthorized -

Merchants Bank’s primary operating subsidiaries include Merchants Capital Corp. (“MCC”), Merchants\nCapital Servicing, LLC (“MCS”), and Merchants Capital Investments, LLC (“MCI”). All direct and indirectly owned\nsubsidiaries owned by Merchants Bancorp are collectively referred to as the “Company”.\nMerchants Bank operates under an Indiana state bank charter and provides full banking services. As a state\nbank and non-Federal Reserve member, it is subject to the regulation of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions\n(“IDFI”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Company is further subject to regulations of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) governing bank holding companies. Merchants\nBank operates from six locations in Indiana, including Lynn, Spartanburg, Richmond, Carmel and Indianapolis.\nMerchants Bank generates multi-family, commercial, mortgage and consumer loans and receives deposits from\ncustomers located primarily in Hamilton, Marion, Wayne, Randolph and surrounding counties in Indiana. Merchants\nBank’s loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real property, consumer assets and business\nassets. Merchants Bank’s Mortgage Warehousing segment funds and participates in single-family and multi-family,\nagency eligible loans across the nation.\nPrior to the sale of its branches, and merger of its remaining charter into Merchants Bank, on January 26, 2024,\nFMBI operated under an Illinois state bank charter and provided full banking services. As a state bank and non-Federal\nReserve member, it was subject to the regulation of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation\n(“IDFPR”) and the FDIC. FMBI operated from four offices located in Joy, Paxton, Melvin, and Piper City, Illinois.\nMCC is primarily engaged in mortgage banking, specializing in lending for multi-family rental properties and\nhealthcare facilities. It is a Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”) approved mortgagee and a Government National\nMortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) Affordable, and Federal\nHome Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) issuer. It is also a fully integrated syndicator of low-income housing\ntax credit and debt funds.\nSale of Farmers-Merchants Bank of Illinois branches\nOn September 7, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Bank of Pontiac to sell its Farmers-\nMerchants Bank of Illinois branch locations in Paxton, Melvin, and Piper City, Illinois, and into an agreement with CBI\nBank & Trust, to sell its Farmers-Merchants Bank of Illinois branch located in Joy, Illinois.\nThis transaction enhances the Company’s ability to focus on its core business of single and multi-family\nmortgage lending and strategically aligns the branches with institutions that share a similar business model and allows\nthem to provide additional products to their customers.\nOn January 26, 2024, the transaction was completed after having met customary closing conditions, including\nregulatory approval.\nIn addition to the branches, Bank of Pontiac acquired approximately $164.8 million in deposits and $19.2\nmillion in loans, and CBI Bank & Trust acquired approximately $65.1 million in deposits and $28.6 million in loans.\nTotal assets of approximately $50.8 million and $230.2 million of liabilities were sold. A net gain of $703,000\nis expected from the transaction, which includes a $10.1 million deposit premium and the extinguishment of $7.8 million\nin goodwill and $0.5 million in intangibles. The gain on the transaction will be recognized during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\n76\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 include results\nfrom the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Merchants Bank, FMBI and MAM. Also included are Merchants\nBank’s primary operating subsidiaries, MCC, MCS and MCI, as well as all direct and indirectly owned subsidiaries\nowned by Merchants Bancorp.\nDuring 2022, Merchants Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, was incorporated and its results are\nconsolidated with the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn addition, when the Company makes an equity investment in or has a relationship with an entity for which it\nholds a variable interest, it is evaluated for consolidation requirements under Accounting Standards Update of Topic\n810. Accordingly, the entity is assessed for potential consolidation under the variable interest entity (“VIE”) model and\nwould only consolidate those entities for which it is a primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is defined as the party\nthat has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity, and an interest that could be\nsignificant to the entity. To determine if an interest could be significant to the entity, both qualitative and quantitative\nfactors regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the entity are evaluated. Alternatively, under the\nvoting interest model, it would only consolidate those entities for which it has a controlling interest.\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired a variable interest in an investment for which it is the primary beneficiary\nof, and its results have been consolidated since the date of acquisition. Additionally, the Company has certain variable\ninterest investments that it was deemed not to be a primary beneficiary of as of December 31, 2023. These VIEs are not\nconsolidated and the equity or proportional method of accounting has been applied. The Company will analyze whether\nthe primary beneficiary designation has changed through triggering events on a prospective basis. Changes in facts and\ncircumstances occurring since the previous primary beneficiary determination will be considered as part of this ongoing\nassessment. See Note 12: Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) for additional information about VIEs.\nAll significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDeconsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements included consolidated results from certain entities primarily involved in\nsingle-family debt financing until January 30, 2021, while the Company was deemed to be a primary beneficiary. On\nFebruary 1, 2021, the Company’s debt fund entities were restructured in such a way that its ownership and participation\nwas significantly reduced with the inclusion of additional, unrelated investors and the Company was no longer classified\nas a primary beneficiary. Accordingly, results from these entities were no longer consolidated after this date, in\naccordance with the consolidation guidelines of the Accounting Standards Update of Topic 810.\nFollowing the deconsolidation, the carrying value of assets and liabilities of these entities were removed from\nthe consolidated balance sheet, and the continuing investments were recorded at fair value at the date of deconsolidation.\nThe total amount deconsolidated from the balance sheet included net assets of approximately $10 million, consisting\nprimarily of $66.6 million in loans receivable and $52.7 million in borrowings with Merchants Bank, that was previously\neliminated in consolidation. The fair value of its continuing investments was approximately $10 million on the\ndeconsolidation date and has been reported in Other Assets after deconsolidation. The estimated fair value was\ndetermined based on third-party evaluations of similar assets in the underlying business. The difference between the fair\nvalue of these deconsolidated entities and their carrying value was deemed to be immaterial, resulting in no gain or loss\non deconsolidation. These continuing investments after deconsolidation are classified as variable interest entities, have\nnot been consolidated, and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 12: Variable Interest\nEntities (VIEs) for additional information about VIEs.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n77\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and fair values of servicing rights and financial instruments.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash amounts due from depository institutions, interest-bearing\ndeposits in other banks, money market accounts, and federal funds sold. For information on restricted cash see Note 2:\nRestriction on Cash and Due from Banks.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash accounts exceeded federally insured limits by approximately\n$564.5 million. Included in this amount is approximately $510.2 million with the Federal Reserve and $5.8 million with\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”), and $156,000 with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(“FHLBC”).\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash accounts exceeded federally insured limits by approximately\n$208.4 million. Included in this amount is approximately $185.6 million with the Federal Reserve and $3.6 million with\nthe FHLBI, and $150,000 with the FHLBC.\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell\nSecurities purchased pursuant to a simultaneous agreement Reverse Repurchase Agreement (“RRA”) to resell\nthe same securities at a specified price and date generally have maturity dates of 90 days or less and are carried at cost.\nEvery 90 days the RRAs rollover.\nMortgage Loans in Process of Securitization\nMortgage loans in process of securitization are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in\nearnings. These include multi-family rental real estate loan originations to be sold as Ginnie Mae mortgage backed\nsecurities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac participation certificates, all of which are pending settlement with firm\ninvestor commitments to purchase the securities, typically occurring within 30 days.\nInvestment Securities\nSecurities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost when the Company has the positive intent and ability to\nhold to maturity. Securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as “available for sale” and recorded\nat fair value. If no fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in\nother comprehensive income. For securities available for sale utilizing the fair value option, the Company periodically\nevaluates the securities for changes in fair value and changes are recognized in current period income. The securities are\nheld with the intent that the gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of other financial instruments. Purchase\npremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.\nGains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific\nidentification method.\nRegular assessments are performed on securities available for sale to confirm there are no perceived credit\nlosses that would require an allowance for credit losses to be established in accordance with FASB Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (“CECL”). Securities held to maturity generally require an allowance for lifetime\nexpected credit losses when the security is purchased. Management considers several factors when making such\nestimates, including issuer bond ratings, historical loss rates for given bond ratings, the financial condition of the issuer,\nand whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the\nsecurities, among others.\n78\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor securities available for sale with an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates the securities to\ndetermine whether the decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related\nfactors or non-credit related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive losses (“AOCL”), net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an ACL for securities available\nfor sale on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to earnings. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both\nthe ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company expects, or is\nrequired, to sell an impaired available for sale security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment\namount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because\nthe security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL in this situation.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, unrealized losses on securities were evaluated to determine if there was any\nother-than-temporary impairment. These unrealized losses were not recognized into income because the Company had\nthe intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future and the decline in fair value was primarily due to\nincreased market rates. The fair value was expected to recover as the securities approached their maturity dates.\nLoans Held for Sale under Mortgage Banking Activities\nThe Company uses participation agreements to fund mortgage loans held for sale from closing or purchase until\nsold to an investor. Under a participation agreement the Company elects to purchase a participation interest of up to\n100% in individual loans. The Company shares proportionately in the interest income and the credit risk until the loan is\nsold to an investor. The Company holds the collateral until it is sent under a bailee arrangement to the investor. Typical\ninvestors are large financial institutions or government agencies. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value\nin the aggregate. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance and included in noninterest\nincome.\nFor all loans held for sale, interest earned from the time of funding to the time of sale is accrued and recognized\nas interest income. Gains and losses on loan sales are recorded in noninterest income.\nThe gain on sale of loans in the income statement may include placement and origination fees, capitalized\nservicing rights, trading gains and losses and other related income or expense.\nLoans\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff\nare reported at their outstanding principal balances, adjusted for unearned income, charge-offs, the ACL-Loans, any\nunamortized deferred fees or costs on originated loans, and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans.\nFor loans amortized at cost, interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance.\nThe Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of loans and\nreports accrued interest separately from the related loan balance in the consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest on\nloans totaled $60.4 million and $35.0 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe Company also elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. The\naccrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in\nprocess of collection. Past-due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on\nnonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against\ninterest income. The interest collected on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the loan can be returned to\nan accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are\nbrought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nFor all loan portfolio segments, the Company promptly charges off loans, or portions thereof, when available\ninformation confirms that specific loans are uncollectable based on information that includes, but is not limited to,\n79\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1) the deteriorating financial condition of the borrower, (2) declining collateral values, and/or (3) legal action, including\nbankruptcy, that impairs the borrower’s ability to adequately meet its obligations.\nWhen cash payments for accrued interest are received on nonaccrual loans in each loan class, the Company\nrecords a reduction in principal on the balance of the loan. For loan modifications, interest income is recognized on an\naccrual basis at the renegotiated rate if the loan is in compliance with the modified terms.\nThe Company offers repurchase agreements to fund mortgage loans held for sale from closing until sale to an\ninvestor. Under a warehousing arrangement the Company funds a mortgage loan as secured financing. The warehousing\narrangement is secured by the underlying mortgages and a combination of deposits, personal guarantees and advance\nrates. The Company typically holds the collateral until it is sent under a bailee arrangement instructing the investor to\nsend proceeds to the Company. Typical investors are large financial institutions or government agencies. Interest earned\nfrom the time of funding to the time of sale is recognized as interest income when accrued. Warehouse fees are accrued\nas noninterest income.\nACL-Loans\nThe Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2022. CECL replaces the previous “Allowance for Loan and Lease\nLosses” standard for measuring credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, the difference in the two measurements was\nrecorded in the ACL-Loans and retained earnings.\nThe ACL-Loans is the Company’s estimate of current expected credit losses. Loans receivable is presented net\nof the allowance to reflect the principal balance expected to be collected over the contractual term of the loans. This life\nof loan allowance is established through a provision for credit losses charged to net interest income as loans are recorded\nin the financial statements. The provision for a reporting period also reflects increases or decreases in the allowance\nrelated to changes in credit loss expectations. Actual credit losses are charged against the allowance when management\nbelieves the uncollectability of a loan balance, or a portion thereof, is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are\ncredited to the allowance.\nThe ACL-Loans is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic\nreview of the collectability of the loans considering relevant available information from internal and external sources,\nincluding historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the\nborrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. The\nallowance also incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts. There have been no changes to the credit quality\ncomponents used to assess risk during the year ended December 31, 2023. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it\nrequires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The level of the\nACL is believed to be adequate to absorb innate expected future losses in the loan portfolio as of the measurement date.\nThe ACL-Loans consists of individually evaluated loans and pooled loan components. The Company’s primary\nportfolio segmentation is by segmenting loans with similar risk characteristics. Loans risk graded substandard and worse\nare individually evaluated for expected credit losses. For individually evaluated loans that are collateral dependent, the\nCompany may use the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, as a practical expedient as of the reporting\ndate to determine the carrying amount of an asset and the allowance for credit losses, as applicable. A loan is considered\nto be collateral dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or the sale of\nthe collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the reporting date.\nTo calculate the allowance for expected credit losses on loans risk graded pass through special mention, the\nportfolio is segmented by loans with similar risk characteristics.\nLoan Portfolio Segment ACL-Loans Methodology\nMortgage warehouse repurchase agreements Remaining Life Method\nResidential real estate loans Discounted Cash Flow\nMulti-family financing Discounted Cash Flow\nHealthcare financing Discounted Cash Flow\nCommercial and commercial real estate Discounted Cash Flow\nAgricultural production and real estate Remaining Life Method\nConsumer and margin loans Remaining Life Method\n80\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLoan characteristics used in determining the segmentation included the underlying collateral, type or purpose of\nthe loan, and expected credit loss patterns. The initial estimate of expected credit losses for each segment is based on\nhistorical credit loss experience and management’s judgement. Given the Company’s modest historical credit loss\nexperience, peer and industry data was incorporated into the measurement. Expected life of loan credit losses are\nquantified using discounted cash flows and remaining life methodologies.\nModel results are supplemented by qualitative adjustments for risk factors relevant in assessing the expected\ncredit losses within the portfolio segments. These adjustments may increase or decrease the estimate of expected credit\nlosses based upon the assessed level of risk for each qualitative factor.\nThe models utilized and the applicable qualitative adjustments require assumptions and management judgement\nthat can be subjective in nature. The above measurement approach is also used to estimate the expected credit losses\nassociated with unfunded loan commitments, which also incorporates expected utilization rates.\nACL-Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures (“OBCEs”)\nThe allowance for credit losses on OBCEs is a liability account representing expected credit losses over the\ncontractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend\ncredit. No allowance is recognized if the Company has the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. OBCEs primarily\nconsist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit. For the period of exposure, the\nestimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur, and the amount expected to be\nfunded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance sheet exposure. The likelihood and\nexpected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents\nmanagement’s best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of\nthe commitment. The allowance for OBCEs is adjusted through the income statement as a component of provision for\ncredit loss.\nACL-Guarantees\nThe allowance for credit losses on guarantees (“ACL-Guarantees”) is a liability account representing expected\ncredit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a reimbursement\nand security agreement with Freddie Mac. This agreement was associated with the Company’s May 2022 securitization\narrangement. The Company agreed to reimburse Freddie Mac for a first loss position in the underlying loan portfolio,\nnot to exceed 12% of the unpaid principal amount of the loans comprising the securitization pool at settlement. An initial\nACL – Guarantee of $1.2 million was established. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses\nconsiders both the likelihood that losses will occur and the amount of losses over the estimated remaining life of the\nguarantee. The likelihood and expected losses are based on historical loan loss experience from peers, as well as from\nsimilar loans in our ACL-Loans, for each class of loans. The amount of the allowance represents management’s best\nestimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the commitment. The ACL - Guarantees is adjusted through\nthe income statement as a component of provision for credit loss. Also see Note 5: Loans and Allowance for Credit\nLosses.\nPremises and Equipment\nDepreciable assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged to expense using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nThe estimated useful lives for premises and equipment are as follows:\nBuildings 7 to 40 years\nLeasehold improvements 2 to 11 years\nSoftware and intangible assets 5 to 10 years\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 to 15 years\nVehicles 5 years\n81\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nExpenditures for property and equipment and for renewals or betterments that extend the originally estimated\neconomic life of the assets are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense. When an\nasset is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any\ngain or loss is included in the results of operations.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for various locations with terms ranging from one to eleven years. Operating\nleases are included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and lease expense for lease\npayments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the term. An ROU asset\nrepresents the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and also includes any direct costs and payments made\nprior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives. When an implicit rate is not available, an incremental\nborrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date is used in determining the present value of the\nlease payments. The Company elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components for its operating\nleases. A lease term may include an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the option will\nbe exercised. Renewal and termination options are considered when determining short-term leases. Leases are accounted\nfor at the individual level.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock is a required investment for institutions that are members of a FHLB.\nThe required investment in the common stock is based on a predetermined formula, carried at cost and evaluated for\nimpairment.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are classified as other assets and are initially recorded at\nfair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations\nare periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less\ncost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net income or\nexpense from other real estate.\nServicing Rights\nServicing assets are recognized separately when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of\nfinancial assets. Under the servicing assets and liabilities accounting guidance (ASC 860-50), servicing rights resulting\nfrom the sale or securitization of loans originated by the Company are initially measured at fair value at the date of\ntransfer. The Company has elected to initially and subsequently measure the servicing rights for mortgage loans using\nthe fair value method. Under the fair value method, the servicing rights are carried in the balance sheet at fair value and\nthe changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur.\nFair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or\nalternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.\nThe valuation model is from an independent third party and it incorporates assumptions that market participants would\nuse in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an\ninflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, prepayment penalties, and default rates and losses. These variables\nchange from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change, and any change in fair values is\nrecorded to noninterest income.\nServicing fee income is recorded when fees are earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a\ncontractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income. The change in\nthe fair value of the mortgage-servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income.\n82\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. If the\nimplied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is indicated and goodwill is\nwritten down to its implied fair value. Subsequent increases in goodwill value are not recognized in the financial\nstatements.\nIntangible assets, which include licenses and trade names, are amortized over a period ranging from 84 to 120\nmonths using a straight-line method of amortization. Customer list intangible assets are amortized over 21 months using\na straight-line method of amortization. Also included are core deposit intangibles that are amortized over a 10 year\nperiod using the accelerated sum of the years digits method of amortization. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates\nevents and circumstances that may indicate a change in the recoverability of the carrying value.\nInvestment in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Limited Partnerships or Limited Liability Companies (“LLC”)\nThe Company has elected to account for its investment in affordable housing tax credit limited partnerships or\nLLCs using the proportional amortization method described in FASB ASU 2014-01, “Investments—Equity Method and\nJoint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Projects (A Consensus of\nthe FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)”, which was updated in March 2023 and released as FASB ASU 2023-02.\nUnder the proportional amortization method, an investor amortizes the initial cost of the investment to income tax\nexpense in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in\nthe income statement as a component of income tax expense. The investment in the limited partnerships or LLCs are\nincluded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nthe Company sold some of these assets to funds in which it is a general partner and in some cases holds a minority\ninterest in the limited partnership or LLC.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and\ndeferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the\nprovisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines\ndeferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or\nliability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and enacted\nchanges in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred income tax expense results from\nchanges in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance\nif, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset\nwill not be realized.\nUncertain tax positions are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax\nposition will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than\n50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation\nprocesses, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently\nmeasured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon\nsettlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or\nnot a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and\ninformation available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment. With a few exceptions, the\nCompany is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities\nfor years before 2020.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, as other noninterest expense.\nThe Company files consolidated income tax returns with its subsidiaries.\n83\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is the Company’s net income available to common shareholders, which represents net\nincome less dividends paid or payable to preferred stock shareholders, if any, divided by the weighted-average number\nof common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated in the same manner as basic\nearnings per share, but also reflects the issuance of additional common shares that would have been diluted if such\nshares had been outstanding, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nThe Company has an equity incentive plan that provides for annual awards of shares to certain members of\nsenior management based upon the Company’s performance and attainment of certain performance goals established by\nthe Board of Directors. Share awards are valued at the estimated fair value on the date of the award and generally vest\nover three years. Compensation expense for the awards is recognized in the consolidated financial statements ratably\nover the vesting period.\nIn 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also approved a plan for non-executive\ndirectors to receive a portion of their annual fees in the form of restricted common stock, which has been issued once per\nyear, subsequent to the annual meeting of shareholders. This plan was amended to issue allocated shares on a quarterly\nbasis, beginning after the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.\nIn 2020, the Company established an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) to provide certain benefits for\nall employees who meet certain requirements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s principal source of revenue is interest income from loans, investment securities and other\nfinancial instruments that are not within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from\nContracts with Customers”. The Company has evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that\nfurther disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income was not necessary. Because performance obligations are satisfied as services\nare rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in applying Topic 606 that\nsignificantly affects the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.\nThe Company recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as\nservices are provided and collectability is reasonably assured.\nInterest income on loans is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances,\nexcept for interest on loans in nonaccrual status. Interest on loans in nonaccrual status is recorded as a reduction of loan\nprincipal when received.\nThe Company also earns other noninterest income through a variety of financial and transaction services\nprovided to corporate and consumer clients such as deposit service charges, debit card network fees, safe deposit box\nrental fees, LIHTC syndication, and asset management fees. Revenue is recorded for noninterest income based on the\ncontractual terms for the service or transaction performed.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable\nincome taxes. Other comprehensive income (loss) and accumulated other comprehensive income consist of unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) on available for sale investment securities and reclassification adjustments for investment\ngains/(losses) on the sale of available for sale investment securities.\n84\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company occasionally enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk\nmanagement strategies. These derivative financial instruments consist primarily of interest rate locks, forward sale\ncommitments, interest rate swaps, put options, and interest rate floor contracts. These derivative instruments are recorded\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as either an asset or liability, at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized\nin noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also offers interest rate swaps to some\ncustomers through a third-party dealer. These derivatives generally work together as an economic interest rate hedge, but\nthe Company does not designate them for hedge accounting treatment. Consequently, changes in fair value of the\ncorresponding derivative financial asset or liability are recorded as either a charge or credit to current earnings during the\nperiod in which the changes occurred, typically resulting in no net earnings impact.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications may have been made to the 2022 and 2021 financial statements to conform to the\nfinancial statement presentation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. These reclassifications had no effect on\nnet income.\nNote 2: Restriction on Cash and Due From Banks\nOn March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced all banks’ reserve requirements to 0%. The effective reserve\nrequirement has remained at 0% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIncluded in cash equivalents is an account restricted as collateral for the potential risk of loss on senior credit\nlinked notes issued by the Company in March 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there was $36.4 million in restricted\ncash. Also see Note 14: Borrowings.\nNote 3: Investment Securities\nThe amortized cost and approximate fair values, together with gross unrealized gains and losses, of securities\navailable for sale and held to maturity were as follows:\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2023\nGross Gross Approximate\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost (1) Gains Losses Value\n(In thousands)\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes $ 129,261 $ 45 $ 338 $ 128,968\nFederal agencies 250,731 — 2,976 247,755\nMortgage-backed - Government Agency (\"Agency\") (2) 14,465 5 3 14,467\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency residential - fair value option 485,500 — — 485,500\nMortgage-backed - Agency - fair value option 236,997 — — 236,997\nTotal securities available for sale $ 1,116,954 $ 50 $ 3,317 $ 1,113,687\nSecurities held to maturity:\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency multi-family $ 719,662 $ — $ 415 $ 719,247\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency residential 472,539 973 418 473,094\nMortgage-backed - Agency 12,016 — 822 11,194\nTotal securities held to maturity $ 1,204,217 $ 973 $ 1,655 $ 1,203,535\n(1) For fair value option securities, the amortized cost reflects the carrying value, which is also equal to the fair value.\n(2) Agency includes government sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginne Mae.\n85\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2022\nGross Gross Approximate\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost Gains Losses Value\n(In thousands)\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes $ 37,234 $ 1 $ 955 $ 36,280\nFederal agencies 284,986 — 13,096 271,890\nMortgage-backed - Agency 15,167 7 7 15,167\nTotal securities available for sale $ 337,387 $ 8 $ 14,058 $ 323,337\nSecurities held to maturity:\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency multi-family $ 871,772 $ 12 $ — $ 871,784\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency residential 247,306 — 124 247,182\nTotal securities held to maturity $ 1,119,078 $ 12 $ 124 $ 1,118,966\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, agency mortgage-backed securities included in the tables above are primarily\nbacked by multi-family and single-family loans.\nDuring 2023 the Company acquired both agency and non-agency mortgage-backed available for sale securities\nthat are being carried utilizing the fair value option. Changes in the fair value are recognized in other income as they\noccur. These fair value option securities are included in the table above at December 31, 2023.\nAccrued interest on securities available for sale totaled $6.7 million at December 31, 2023 and $0.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nAccrued interest on securities held to maturity totaled $5.8 million at December 31, 2023 and $4.3 million at\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale and held to maturity at December 31, 2023, by\ncontractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may\nhave the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, one of the mortgage-backed –\n86\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nnon-agency multi-family securities available for sale was sold for $11.4 million resulting in no gain or loss. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale were $38.6 million, and a net gain of\n$191,000 was recognized, consisting of $191,000 in gains and $0 of losses.\nThe carrying value of securities pledged as collateral, to secure borrowings, public deposits and for other\npurposes, was $1.1 billion and $570.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCertain investments in securities available for sale are reported in the consolidated financial statements at an\namount less than their historical cost. The total fair value of these investments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was\n$263.4 million (28 positions) and $308.0 million (37 positions), respectively, which is approximately 24%, and 95%,\nrespectively, of the Company’s available for sale investment portfolio.\nCertain investments in securities held to maturity are reported in the consolidated financial statements at\namortized cost. The amortized cost of these investments that were reported at less than their fair value at December 31,\n2023 and 2022 totaled $777.7 million (8 positions) and $247.2 million (2 positions), respectively, which is\napproximately 65% and 22%, respectively, of the Company’s held to maturity investment portfolio.\nThe following tables show the Company’s gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company’s investment\nsecurities with unrealized losses for which an ACL has not been recorded, aggregated by investment class and length of\ntime that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31 , 2023\n12 Months or\nLess than 12 Months Longer Total\nGross Gross Gross\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nValue Losses Value Losses Value Losses\n(In thousands)\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes $ 3,052 $ 6 $ 32,080 $ 332 $ 35,132 $ 338\nFederal agencies 60,541 189 167,213 2,787 227,754 2,976\nMortgage-backed - Agency 364 1 186 2 550 3\n$ 63,957 $ 196 $ 199,479 $ 3,121 $ 263,436 $ 3,317\nDecemb er 3 1, 2022\n12 Months or\nLess than 12 Months Longer Total\nGross Gross Gross\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nValue Losses Value Losses Value Losses\n(In thousands)\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes $ 29,560 $ 762 $ 5,798 $ 193 $ 35,358 $ 955\nFederal agencies 19,276 724 252,613 12,372 271,889 13,096\nMortgage-backed - Agency 709 7 — — 709 7\n$ 49,545 $ 1,493 $ 258,411 $ 12,565 $ 307,956 $ 14,058\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nFor available for sale securities with an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates the securities to\ndetermine whether the decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related\nfactors or noncredit related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an ACL for available for sale\nsecurities on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to earnings. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both\nthe ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company expects, or is\nrequired, to sell an impaired available for sale security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment\n87\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\namount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because\nthe security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL in this situation.\nIn evaluating available for sale securities in unrealized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding\nits intent or requirement to sell such securities, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than\namortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond\nrating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, among other factors.\nUnrealized losses on the Company’s investment securities portfolio have not been recognized as an expense because the\nsecurities are of high credit quality, and the decline in fair values is attributable to changes in the prevailing interest rate\nenvironment since the purchase date. Fair value is expected to recover as securities reach maturity and/or the interest rate\nenvironment returns to conditions similar to when these securities were purchased. There were no credit related factors\nunderlying unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nSecurities held to maturity are comprised of non-agency mortgage-backed securities secured by multi-family or\nsingle-family properties, and agency mortgage-backed securities secured by multi-family properties. The agency\nsecurities are Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\nAccordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. The non-agency securities were\npurchased under securitization arrangements where a credit loss component was purchased by third party investors.\nThese securities were evaluated for credit losses over and above the credit loss percentage sold under the arrangements,\nand the Company does not anticipate any such losses. Additional qualitative factors are evaluated, including the\ntimeliness of principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Accordingly, no allowance for\ncredit losses has been recorded for the non-agency securities.\nNote 4: Mortgage Loans in Process of Securitization\nMortgage loans in process of securitization are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in\nearnings. These include multi-family rental real estate loan originations to be sold as Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed\nsecurities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac participation certificates, all of which are pending settlement with firm\ninvestor commitments to purchase the securities, typically occurring within 30 days. The fair value increases recorded in\nearnings for mortgage loans in process of securitization totaled $0.8 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\n88\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 5: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nLoan Portfolio Summary\nLoans receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, include:\nD ecember 31, D ecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nMortgage warehouse repurchase agreements $ 752,468 $ 464,785\nResidential real estate(1) 1,324,305 1,178,401\nMulti-family financing 4,006,160 3,135,535\nHealthcare financing 2,356,689 1,604,341\nCommercial and commercial real estate(2)(3) 1,643,081 978,661\nAgricultural production and real estate 103,150 95,651\nConsumer and margin loans 13,700 13,498\n10,199,553 7,470,872\nLess:\nACL - Loans 71,752 44,014\nLoans Receivable $ 10,127,801 $ 7,426,858\n(1) Includes $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of All-in-One first-lien home equity lines of credit at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n(2) Includes $1.1 billion and $497.0 million of revolving lines of credit collateralized primarily by mortgage servicing rights as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(3) Includes only $8.4 million and $12.8 million of non-owner occupied commercial real estate as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nRisk characteristics applicable to each segment of the loan portfolio are described as follows.\nMortgage Warehouse Repurchase Agreements (MTG WHRA): Under its warehouse program, the\nCompany provides warehouse financing arrangements to approved mortgage companies for the origination and sale of\nresidential mortgage loans and to a lesser extent multi-family loans. Agency eligible, governmental and jumbo\nresidential mortgage loans that are secured by mortgages placed on existing one-to-four family dwellings may be\noriginated or purchased and placed on each mortgage warehouse facility.\nAs a secured repurchase agreement, collateral pledged to the Company secures each individual mortgage until\nthe lender sells the loan in the secondary market. A traditional secured warehouse facility typically carries a base interest\nrate of the Federal Reserve’s Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), or mortgage note rate and a margin.\nRisk is evident if there is a change in the fair value of mortgage loans originated by mortgage bankers in\nwarehouse, the sale of which is the expected source of repayment under a warehouse facility. However, the warehouse\ncustomers are required to hedge the change in value of these loans to mitigate the risk, typically through forward sales\ncontracts.\nResidential Real Estate Loans (RES RE): Real estate loans are secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family\nresidences. Repayment of residential real estate loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of\nthe borrowers. First-lien HELOC mortgages included in this segment typically carried a base rate of 30-day LIBOR, plus\na margin. With the sunset of LIBOR, loans have been transitioned to the One-Year Constant Maturity Treasury\n(“CMT”), plus a margin.\n89\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMulti-Family Financing (MF FIN): The Company engages in multi-family financing, including construction\nloans, specializing in originating and servicing loans for multi-family rental properties. In addition, the Company\noriginates loans secured by an assignment of federal income tax credits by partnerships invested in multi-family real\nestate projects. Construction and land loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the\ncompleted project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property\nowners. Sources of repayment of these loans are dependent on the cash flow of the property, and may include permanent\nloans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent agency-eligible\nfinancing is obtained. Credit risk in these loans may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values\nand the local economy in the Company’s market area. Repayment of these loans depends on the successful operation of\na business or property and the borrower’s cash flows. Loans included in this segment typically carry a base rate of\nSOFR, that adjusts on a monthly basis, and a margin.\nHealthcare Financing (HC FIN): The healthcare financing portfolio includes customized loan products for\nindependent living, assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing projects. A variety of loan products are available to\naccommodate rehabilitation, acquisition, and refinancing of healthcare properties. Credit risk in these loans are primarily\ndriven by local demographics and the expertise of the operators of the facilities. Repayment of these loans may include\npermanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent\nagency-eligible financing is obtained, as well as successful operation of a business or property and the borrower’s cash\nflows. Loans included in this segment typically carry a base rate of SOFR, that adjusts on a monthly basis, and a margin.\nCommercial Lending and Commercial Real Estate Loans (CML & CRE): The commercial lending and\ncommercial real estate portfolio includes loans to commercial customers for use in financing working capital needs,\nequipment purchases and expansions, as well as loans to commercial customers to finance land and improvements. It\nalso includes lines of credit collateralized by servicing rights. The loans in this category are repaid primarily from the\ncash flow of a borrower’s principal business operation. Credit risk in these loans is driven by creditworthiness of a\nborrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations. Small Business\nAdministration (“SBA”) loans are included in this category. Less than 1% of total commercial and commercial real\nestate loans are made up of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. The Company strategically focuses on\nloan classes that are government backed or can be sold in the secondary market.\nAgricultural Production and Real Estate Loans (AG & AGRE): Agricultural production loans are generally\ncomprised of seasonal operating lines of credit to grain farmers to plant and harvest corn and soybeans and term loans to\nfund the purchase of equipment. The Company also offers long term financing to purchase agricultural real estate.\nSpecific underwriting standards have been established for agricultural-related loans including the establishment of\nprojections for each operating year based on industry-developed estimates of farm input costs and expected commodity\nyields and prices. Operating lines are typically written for one year and secured by the crop and other farm assets as\nconsidered necessary. The Company is approved to sell agricultural loans in the secondary market through the Federal\nAgricultural Mortgage Corporation and uses this relationship to manage interest rate risk within the portfolio.\nAgricultural real estate loans included in this segment are typically structured with a one-year adjustable rate mortgage\n(“ARM”), 3-year ARM or 5-year ARM CMT and a margin. Agriculture production, livestock, and equipment loans are\nstructured with variable rates that are indexed to prime or fixed for terms not exceeding 5 years.\nConsumer and Margin Loans (CON & MAR): Consumer loans are those loans secured by household\nassets. Margin loans are those loans secured by marketable securities. The term and maximum amount for these loans\nare determined by considering the purpose of the loan, the margin (advance percentage against value) in all collateral,\nthe primary source of repayment, and the borrower’s other related cash flow.\n90\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents, by loan portfolio segment, the activity in the ACL-Loans for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAt or F o r the Year E nd ed Decemb er 3 1, 2023\nMTG WHRA RES RE MF FIN HC FIN CML & CRE AG & AGRE CON & MAR TOTAL\n(In thousands)\nACL - Loans\nBalance, beginning of period $ 1,249 $ 7,029 $ 16,781 $ 9,882 $ 8,326 $ 565 $ 182 $ 44,014\nProvision for credit losses 821 328 18,493 12,572 5,232 54 (12) 37,488\nLoans charged to the allowance — (34) (8,400) — (1,356) — (1) (9,791)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off — — — — 41 — — 41\nBalance, end of period $ 2,070 $ 7,323 $ 26,874 $ 22,454 $ 12,243 $ 619 $ 169 $ 71,752\nThe Company recorded a total provision for credit losses of $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe $40.2 million provision for credit losses consisted of $37.5 million for the ACL-Loans as shown above and $2.7\nmillion for the ACL-OBCEs.\nAt or F o r the Year E nd ed Decemb er 3 1, 2022\nMTG WHRA RES RE MF FIN HC FIN CML & CRE AG & AGRE CON & MAR TOTAL\n(In thousands)\nACL - Loans\nBalance, beginning of period $ 1,955 $ 4,170 $ 14,084 $ 4,461 $ 5,879 $ 657 $ 138 $ 31,344\nImpact of adopting CECL 41 275 520 139 (1,277) (18) 21 (299)\nProvision for credit losses (747) 2,588 2,177 5,282 4,216 (74) 31 13,473\nLoans charged to the allowance — (4) — — (1,238) — (15) (1,257)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off — — — — 746 — 7 753\nBalance, end of period $ 1,249 $ 7,029 $ 16,781 $ 9,882 $ 8,326 $ 565 $ 182 $ 44,014\nThe Company recorded a total provision for credit losses of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe $17.3 million provision for credit losses consisted of $13.5 million for the ACL-Loans as shown above, $2.6 million\nfor the ACL-OBCEs, and $1.2 million for the ACL-Guarantees, contingent reserve related to the Freddie Mac-sponsored\nQ-series securitization transaction.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, the Company maintained an allowance for loan losses in accordance with the\nincurred loss model as disclosed in the Company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables presents the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021:\nFor t h e Year E nd ed Decembe r 31 , 2021\nMTG WHRA RES RE MF FIN HC FIN CML & CRE AG & AGRE CON & MAR TOTAL\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for loan losses\nBalance, beginning of year $ 4,018 $ 3,334 $ 12,140 $ 2,591 $ 4,641 $ 636 $ 140 $ 27,500\nProvision (credit) for loan losses (2,063) 838 1,944 1,870 2,422 21 (20) 5,012\nLoans charged to the allowance — (2) — — (1,184) — (6) (1,192)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off — — — — — — 24 24\nBalance, end of year $ 1,955 $ 4,170 $ 14,084 $ 4,461 $ 5,879 $ 657 $ 138 $ 31,344\n91\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe below tables present the amortized cost basis and ACL-Loans allocated for collateral dependent loans,\nwhich are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nD e cem ber 31, 20 23\nAccounts\nReceivable / ACL-Loans\nReal Estate Equipment Other Total Allocation\n(In thousands)\nRES RE $ 1,557 $ — $ 3 $ 1,560 $ 21\nMF FIN 46,575 — — 46,575 521\nHC FIN 73,909 — — 73,909 6,289\nCML & CRE 146 3,603 2,684 6,433 1,132\nAG & AGRE 147 — — 147 1\nCON & MAR — — 3 3 —\nTotal collateral dependent loans $ 122,334 $ 3,603 $ 2,690 $ 128,627 $ 7,964\nThere were no significant changes in the types of collateral securing the Company’s collateral dependent loans\ncompared to December 31, 2022.\nD e cem ber 31, 20 22\nAccounts\nReceivable / ACL-Loans\nReal Estate Equipment Other Total Allocation\n(In thousands)\nRES RE $ 237 $ — $ 9 $ 246 $ 31\nMF FIN 36,760 — — 36,760 173\nHC FIN 21,783 — — 21,783 134\nCML & CRE — 4,917 966 5,883 842\nAG & AGRE 147 — — 147 1\nCON & MAR — — 6 6 —\nTotal collateral dependent loans $ 58,927 $ 4,917 $ 981 $ 64,825 $ 1,181\nInternal Risk Categories\nThe Company evaluates the loan risk grading system definitions and ACL-Loans methodology on an ongoing\nbasis. As of December 31, 2023, the Company created a newly defined special mention risk rating category to be\nconsistent with industry practices. Loans with a Watch classification are now included in the Pass risk rating category as\nof December 31, 2023. This updated policy was approved by the Company’s Asset-Liability Committee (“ALCO”), to\nbe effective as of December 31, 2023 on a prospective basis.\nIn adherence with policy, the Company uses the following internal risk grading categories and definitions for\nloans as of December 31, 2023:\nPass - Loans that are considered to be of acceptable credit quality, and not classified as Special Mention,\nSubstandard or Doubtful. Also included are loans classified as watch loans, which represent loans that remain sound and\ncollectible but contain elevated risk that requires management’s attention.\nSpecial Mention – Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s\nclose attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for\nthe asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and\ndo not warrant adverse classification. Loans with questions or concerns regarding collateral, adverse market conditions\nimpacting future performance, and declining financial trends would be considered for special mention.\nSubstandard - Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying\ncapacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or\nweaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the\ninstitution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. When a loan in the form of a line of credit is\ndowngraded to substandard, future draws under the line of credit require the approval of an officer of Senior Credit\nOfficer or above.\n92\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDoubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard,\nwith the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing\nfacts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\n93\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the credit risk profile of the Company’s loan portfolio based on internal risk rating\ncategories as of December 31, 2023:\nDecemb er 3 1, 2023\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior R evolving Loans TOTAL\n(In thousands)\nMTG WHRA\nPass $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 752,468 $ 752,468\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 752,468 $ 752,468\nCharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nRES RE\nPass 31,011 10,086 6,573 22,725 3,298 9,340 1,239,161 1,322,194\nSpecial Mention — — — — 59 492 — 551\nSubstandard — — — — — 288 1,272 1,560\nTotal $ 31,011 $ 10,086 $ 6,573 $ 22,725 $ 3,357 $ 10,120 $ 1,240,433 $ 1,324,305\nCharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 21 $ 13 $ 34\nMF FIN\nPass 1,094,698 762,448 208,343 77,340 29,764 8,455 1,646,445 3,827,493\nSpecial Mention 94,973 3,189 8,400 — — 1,477 24,052 132,091\nSubstandard 11,682 28,360 6,534 — — — — 46,576\nTotal $ 1,201,353 $ 793,997 $ 223,277 $ 77,340 $ 29,764 $ 9,932 $ 1,670,497 $ 4,006,160\nCharge-offs $ — $ 8,400 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 8,400\nHC FIN\nPass 752,591 996,273 110,197 — 14,563 — 351,110 2,224,734\nSpecial Mention 35,869 9,520 — — — — 12,658 58,047\nSubstandard 25,600 10,625 28,783 — — — 8,900 73,908\nTotal $ 814,060 $ 1,016,418 $ 138,980 $ — $ 14,563 $ — $ 372,668 $ 2,356,689\nCharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCML & CRE\nPass 51,110 119,386 77,316 21,154 21,088 17,066 1,328,980 1,636,100\nSpecial Mention — — 292 172 — 84 — 548\nSubstandard — 70 1,701 878 62 — 3,672 6,383\nDoubtful — — — — — 50 — 50\nTotal $ 51,110 $ 119,456 $ 79,309 $ 22,204 $ 21,150 $ 17,200 $ 1,332,652 $ 1,643,081\nCharge-offs $ — $ 496 $ 274 $ 586 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,356\nAG & AGRE\nPass 16,850 9,825 6,490 14,267 5,237 16,606 33,728 103,003\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — 147 — 147\nTotal $ 16,850 $ 9,825 $ 6,490 $ 14,267 $ 5,237 $ 16,753 $ 33,728 $ 103,150\nCharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCON & MAR\nPass 748 4,329 247 115 27 4,339 3,862 13,667\nSpecial Mention — — — 15 15 — — 30\nSubstandard — — — — — 3 — 3\nTotal $ 748 $ 4,329 $ 247 $ 130 $ 42 $ 4,342 $ 3,862 $ 13,700\nCharge-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1 $ — $ 1\nTotal Pass $ 1,947,008 $ 1,902,347 $ 409,166 $ 135,601 $ 73,977 $ 55,806 $ 5,355,754 $ 9,879,659\nTotal Special Mention $ 130,842 $ 12,709 $ 8,692 $ 187 $ 74 $ 2,053 $ 36,710 $ 191,267\nTotal Substandard $ 37,282 $ 39,055 $ 37,018 $ 878 $ 62 $ 438 $ 13,844 $ 128,577\nTotal Doubtful $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 50 $ — $ 50\nTotal Loans $ 2,115,132 $ 1,954,111 $ 454,876 $ 136,666 $ 74,113 $ 58,347 $ 5,406,308 $ 10,199,553\nTotal Charge-offs $ — $ 8,896 $ 274 $ 586 $ — $ 22 $ 13 $ 9,791\n94\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Company did not have any material revolving loans converted to term loans at December 31, 2023.\nPrior to the updated policy described above, the Company used the following internal risk grading categories\nand definitions for loans as of December 31, 2022:\nPass – Loans that are considered to be of acceptable credit quality, and not classified as Special Mention,\nSubstandard or Doubtful.\nSpecial Mention (Watch) – This is a loan that is sound and collectable but contains potential risk.

They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the\ninstitution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard,\nwith the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing\nfacts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\n95\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the credit risk profile of the Company’s loan portfolio based on internal risk rating\ncategories as of December 31, 2022:\nDecemb er 3 1, 2022\n2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior Revolving Loans TOTAL\n(In thousands)\nMTG WHRA\nPass — — — — — — 464,785 464,785\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 464,785 $ 464,785\nRES RE\nPass 13,344 8,192 24,708 3,498 1,722 11,166 1,114,705 1,177,335\nSpecial Mention (Watch) — — — 61 — 668 91 820\nSubstandard — — — — 74 172 — 246\nTotal $ 13,344 $ 8,192 $ 24,708 $ 3,559 $ 1,796 $ 12,006 $ 1,114,796 $ 1,178,401\nMF FIN\nPass 1,212,008 544,823 200,829 32,349 4,416 7,229 1,042,024 3,043,678\nSpecial Mention (Watch) 32,919 — 8,000 — — — 14,178 55,097\nSubstandard 36,760 — — — — — — 36,760\nTotal $ 1,281,687 $ 544,823 $ 208,829 $ 32,349 $ 4,416 $ 7,229 $ 1,056,202 $ 3,135,535\nHC FIN\nPass 987,676 301,103 78,792 13,770 — — 123,888 1,505,229\nSpecial Mention (Watch) 52,022 25,307 — — — — — 77,329\nSubstandard — 21,783 — — — — — 21,783\nTotal $ 1,039,698 $ 348,193 $ 78,792 $ 13,770 $ — $ — $ 123,888 $ 1,604,341\nCML & CRE\nPass 123,757 86,282 23,803 24,730 12,335 8,765 690,114 969,786\nSpecial Mention (Watch) 43 164 963 119 99 228 1,376 2,992\nSubstandard — 2,017 591 72 — 666 2,537 5,883\nTotal $ 123,800 $ 88,463 $ 25,357 $ 24,921 $ 12,434 $ 9,659 $ 694,027 $ 978,661\nAG & AGRE\nPass 12,112 7,485 15,660 5,808 3,137 20,176 29,566 93,944\nSpecial Mention (Watch) 14 55 462 421 163 389 56 1,560\nSubstandard — — — — — 147 — 147\nTotal $ 12,126 $ 7,540 $ 16,122 $ 6,229 $ 3,300 $ 20,712 $ 29,622 $ 95,651\nCON & MAR\nPass 4,673 463 307 101 4,589 9 3,328 13,470\nSpecial Mention (Watch) — — 20 — — 2 — 22\nSubstandard — — — — — 6 — 6\nTotal $ 4,673 $ 463 $ 327 $ 101 $ 4,589 $ 17 $ 3,328 $ 13,498\nTotal Pass $ 2,353,570 $ 948,348 $ 344,099 $ 80,256 $ 26,199 $ 47,345 $ 3,468,410 $ 7,268,227\nTotal Special Mention (Watch) $ 84,998 $ 25,526 $ 9,445 $ 601 $ 262 $ 1,287 $ 15,701 $ 137,820\nTotal Substandard $ 36,760 $ 23,800 $ 591 $ 72 $ 74 $ 991 $ 2,537 $ 64,825\nTotal Loans $ 2,475,328 $ 997,674 $ 354,135 $ 80,929 $ 26,535 $ 49,623 $ 3,486,648 $ 7,470,872\n96\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDelinquent Loans\nThe following tables present the Company’s loan portfolio aging analysis of the recorded investment in loans as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDec em b er 31, 2023\n30-59 Days 60-89 Days G reater Than Total Total\nPast Due Past Due 90 Days Past Due Current Loans\n(In thousands)\nMTG WHRA $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 752,468 $ 752,468\nRES RE 4,557 — 2,379 6,936 1,317,369 1,324,305\nMF FIN 38,218 11,055 39,609 88,882 3,917,278 4,006,160\nHC FIN — 47,275 35,999 83,274 2,273,415 2,356,689\nCML & CRE 172 393 3,665 4,230 1,638,851 1,643,081\nAG & AGRE 27 11 147 185 102,965 103,150\nCON & MAR 1 3 18 22 13,678 13,700\n$ 42,975 $ 58,737 $ 81,817 $ 183,529 $ 10,016,024 $ 10,199,553\nDecem b er 31, 2022\n30-59 Days 6 0-89 Days G reater Than Total Total\nPast Due Past Due 90 Days Past Due Current Loans\n(In thousands)\nMTG WHRA $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 464,785 $ 464,785\nRES RE 4,053 152 272 4,477 1,173,924 1,178,401\nMF FIN — — — — 3,135,535 3,135,535\nHC FIN — — 21,783 21,783 1,582,558 1,604,341\nCML & CRE 4,759 — 3,778 8,537 970,124 978,661\nAG & AGRE 4,903 — — 4,903 90,748 95,651\nCON & MAR 6 24 22 52 13,446 13,498\n$ 13,721 $ 176 $ 25,855 $ 39,752 $ 7,431,120 $ 7,470,872\nThe above tables do not include one delinquent loan that was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2023,\ntotaling $16.5 million.\nNonperforming Loans\nNonaccrual loans, including modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that have not met the\nsix-month minimum performance criterion, are reported as nonperforming loans.

The Company adopted the\nprospective approach for this new guidance.\nOccasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness,\nterm extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. In some cases, the Company\nprovides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is\ngranted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal\nforgiveness, may be granted. For the loans included in the “combination” columns below, multiple types of\nmodifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans at December 31, 2023 that were both\nexperiencing financial difficulty and modified during the year ended December 31, 2023, by class and by type of\nmodification. There were no new loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.

The transfer of these loans was accounted for as a sale for\nfinancial reporting purposes, in accordance with ASC 860, and a $60,000 loss on sale was recognized. The Company\nwas retained as the mortgage sub-servicer for Freddie Mac on the entire $303.6 million pool of loans. Beyond sub-\nservicing the loans, the Company’s ongoing involvement in this transaction is limited to customary obligations of loan\nsales, including any material breach in representation. In connection with this transaction, a mortgage servicing right of\n$1.5 million was established.\nLoan Sale and Securitization - 2022 Activity\nOn September 22, 2022, the Company completed a private securitization by which a $1.2 billion\nportfolio of originated multi-family bridge loans was sold into a real estate mortgage investment conduit (“REMIC”) and\nultimately sold to investors as securities. The Company purchased the senior security for a total of $1.0 billion and\nclassified it as a held to maturity security at September 30, 2022. An unaffiliated, third-party institutional investor\npurchased the remaining subordinate interests and maintains the first-loss position on 13.4% of the losses in the loan\nportfolio. This transaction provided the Company an avenue to enhance capital efficiency and minimize credit risk on\nthe balance sheet.\nAs part of the securitization transaction, the Company will be both Master Servicer and Special Servicer of the\nloans. As Master Servicer and Special Servicer, the Company will have obligations to collect and remit payments of\nprincipal and interest, manage payments of taxes and insurance, and otherwise administer the underlying loans.\nBeyond servicing the loans, the Company’s ongoing involvement in this transaction is limited to customary\nobligations of loan sales, including any material breach in representation. In connection with the securitization, the\nCompany received proceeds and accrued interest on loans, net of the acquired securities, of $150.6 million. No\nallowance for credit losses was recognized in connection with purchase of the security, in accordance with ASC 326.\nHowever, the $4.0 million allowance for credit losses associated with the loans sold was released through the provision\nfor credit losses.\nThe transfer of these loans was accounted for as a sale for financial reporting purposes, in accordance with ASC\n860, and a $525,000 net loss on sale was recognized. The net loss on sale included a $5.4 million pricing loss and $4.9\nmillion in transaction expenses partially offset by a $6.7 million positive impact of capitalizing servicing rights\nassociated with this transaction and a $3.2 million recognition of net deferred fee income on loans sold.\n99\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFreddie Mac Q Series Securitization - 2022 Activity\nMay 2022\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company entered into an arrangement through a third-party trust and Freddie Mac, by\nwhich a $214.0 million portfolio of multi-family loans were sold to the trust and ultimately securitized through Freddie\nMac and sold to investors. The Company did not purchase any of the securities. The transfer of these loans was\naccounted for as a sale for financial reporting purposes, in accordance with ASC 860, and a $2.3 million net gain on sale\nwas recognized, which included establishing a contingent and noncontingent reserve and servicing rights associated with\nthis transaction.\nThe Company’s ongoing involvement in this transaction is limited to customary obligations of loan sales,\nincluding any material breach in representation. In connection with the securitization, the Company also entered into a\nreimbursement agreement for a first loss position in the underlying loan portfolio, not to exceed 12% of the unpaid\nprincipal amount of the loans comprising the securitization pool at settlement, or approximately $25.7 million. A\ncontingent reserve of $1.2 million for estimated losses was established with respect to the first loss obligation on May 5,\n2022, which was included in provision for credit losses on the consolidated statement of income and other liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheet. A noncontingent reserve of $2.5 million related to the Company’s reimbursement\nobligation was included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and offset through gain on sale in the\nconsolidated statement of income. The Company was also required to hold collateral against the reimbursement\nagreement. Accordingly, $27.0 million of U.S. Treasury securities were acquired as part of the transaction.\nAs part of the securitization transaction, the Company released all mortgage servicing obligations and rights to\nFreddie Mac, who was designated as the Master Servicer. Freddie Mac appointed the Company with sub-servicing\nobligations, which include obligations to collect and remit payments of principal and interest, manage payments of taxes\nand insurance, and otherwise administer the underlying loans. Accordingly, the Company recognized a mortgage\nservicing asset of $1.2 million on the sale date.\nNovember 2022\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company completed a $284.2 million securitization of 16 multi-family mortgage\nloans through a Freddie Mac-sponsored Q-Series transaction. The Company did not purchase any of the securities as part\nof this transaction. The transfer of these loans was accounted for as a sale for financial reporting purposes, in accordance\nwith ASC 860, and a $121,000 gain on sale was recognized, which included establishing servicing rights associated with\nthis transaction.\nThe Company was retained as the mortgage sub-servicer for Freddie Mac on the entire $284.2 million pool of\nloans. Beyond sub-servicing the loans, the Company’s ongoing involvement in this transaction is limited to customary\nobligations of loan sales, including any material breach in representation. In connection with the transaction a mortgage\nservicing right of $1.3 million was established.\nLoans Purchased\nThe Company purchased $358.5 million and $551.1 million of loans during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n100\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 6: Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to help manage exposure to interest rate risk and the effects\nthat changes in interest rates may have on net income and the fair value of assets and liabilities.\nInternal Interest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company enters into forward contracts for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors\nand enters into interest rate lock commitments with potential borrowers to fund specific mortgage loans that will be sold\ninto the secondary market. The forward contracts are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in\ninterest rates resulting from the Company’s commitment to fund the loans.\nInterest rate swaps are also used by the Company to reduce the risk that significant increases in interest rates\nmay have on the value of certain fixed rate loans held for sale and the respective loan payments received from\nborrowers. All changes in the fair market value of these interest rate swaps and associated loans held for sale have been\nincluded in gain on sale of loans. Any difference between the fixed and floating interest rate components of these\ntransactions have been included in interest income.\nThe Company entered into a contract containing put options and interest rate floors on securities it acquired\nfrom a warehouse customer. These provide protection and prevent losses in value of certain available for sale securities.\nAll changes in the fair market value of these options and floors associated with these securities have been included in\nother noninterest income.\nAll of these items are considered derivatives, but are not designated as accounting hedges, and are recorded at\nfair value with changes in fair value reflected in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income. The fair\nvalue of derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets\nwhile derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents the notional amount and fair value of interest rate locks, forward contracts, interest\nrate swaps, put options and interest rate floors utilized by the Company at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nThis table excludes the fair market value adjustment on loans associated with these derivatives.\nNotional Fair V a lue\nAmount Balance Sheet Location Asset Liability\nDecember 31, 2023 (In thousands) (In thousands)\nInterest rate lock commitments $ 16,526 Other assets/liabilities $ 140 $ 4\nForward contracts 25,500 Other assets/liabilities 4 391\nInterest rate swaps 57,540 Other assets/liabilities 2,610 —\nPut options 748,374 Other assets 25,877 —\nInterest rate floors 748,374 Other assets 6,576 —\n$ 35,207 $ 395\nNotional Fair V a lue\nAmount Balance Sheet Location Asset Liability\nDecember 31, 2022 (In thousands) (In thousands)\nInterest rate lock commitments $ 8,759 Other assets/liabilities $ 28 $ 23\nForward contracts $ 13,096 Other assets/liabilities 46 52\nInterest rate swaps $ 57,574 Other assets/liabilities 3,030 —\n$ 3,104 $ 75\n101\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the periodic changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments on\nthe consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nDerivative gain (loss) included in gain on sale of loans:\nInterest rate lock commitments $ 130 $ (218) $ (5,908)\nForward contracts (includes pair-off settlements) 201 5,277 5,956\nInterest rate swaps (420) 132 —\nNet gain (loss) (89) 5,191 48\nDerivative gain (loss) included in other income:\nPut options 5,629 — —\nInterest rate floors 6,575 — —\nNet gain (loss) $ 12,204 $ — $ —\nDerivatives on Behalf of Customers\nThe Company offers derivative contracts to some customers in connection with their risk management needs.\nThese derivatives include back-to-back interest rate swaps. The Company manages the risk associated with these\ncontracts by entering into an equal and offsetting derivative with a third-party dealer. These derivatives generally work\ntogether as an economic interest rate hedge, but the Company does not designate them for hedge accounting treatment.\nConsequently, changes in fair value of the corresponding derivative financial asset or liability were recorded as either a\ncharge or credit to current earnings during the period in which the changes occurred, typically resulting in no net\nearnings impact.\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities related to derivatives for customers with back-to-back interest\nrate swaps were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nNotional Fair V a lue\nAmount Balance Sheet Location Asset Liability\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023 $ 607,169 Other assets/liabilities $ 12,426 $ 12,426\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 77,495 Other assets/liabilities $ 3,041 $ 3,041\nThe gross gains and losses on these derivative assets and liabilities were recorded in other noninterest income\nand other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income as follows:\nY ear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nGross swap gains $ 9,385 $ 1,910 $ 2,039\nGross swap losses 9,385 1,910 2,039\nNet swap gains (losses) $ — $ — $ —\nThe Company pledged no collateral to secure its obligations under swap contracts at both December 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022.\n102\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 7: Loan Servicing\nMortgage and SBA loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets\nand include multi-family, single-family and SBA loans sold in the secondary market. The risks inherent in servicing\nassets relate primarily to changes in prepayments that result from shifts in interest rates. Call protection is in place on\ncertain multi-family loans to deter from prepayments on a 10-year sliding scale. The Company’s total servicing\nportfolio, primarily managed in the Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment, had an unpaid principal balance of $26.0\nbillion and $21.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Included in the December 31, 2023 and 2022\namounts, respectively, were unpaid principal balances of loans serviced for others of $15.3 billion and $13.1 billion, an\nunpaid principal balance of loans sub-serviced for others of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, and other servicing balances of\n$721.1 million and $663.1 million. The Company also manages $7.9 billion and $6.2 billion of loans for customers that\nhave loans on the balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The servicing portfolio is primarily Ginnie\nMae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac loans and is a significant source of our noninterest income and deposits.\nThe following summarizes the activity in servicing rights measured using the fair value method for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nFor th e Year Ende d\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nBalance, beginning of period $ 146,248 $ 110,348 $ 82,604\nAdditions\nPurchased servicing 513 — 2,057\nOriginated servicing 14,755 27,124 30,421\nSubtractions\nPaydowns (7,621) (10,985) (16,691)\nSold servicing — — (438)\nChanges in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions\nused in the valuation model 4,562 19,761 12,395\nBalance, end of period $ 158,457 $ 146,248 $ 110,348\nContractually specified servicing fees for retained, purchased and sub-serviced loans were $29.3 million,\n$21.4 million, and $20.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nIn connection with certain loan servicing and sub-servicing agreements, the Company is to reconcile the\npayments received monthly on these loans, for principal and interest, taxes, insurance, and replacement reserves. The\nfunds are required to be maintained in separate trust accounts and not commingled with the Company’s general\noperating funds. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company held restricted escrow funds for these loans at the Bank\nor other financial institution, amounting to $1.3 billion and $777.7 million, respectively.\nNote 8: Goodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill at December 31, 2023 remained unchanged compared to December 31, 2022. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company’s market capitalization was above its book value, despite stock market volatility, rising interest rates\nand inflation concerns. Goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net\nassets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that\nindicate a goodwill impairment test should be performed.

These investments are primarily made of up of investments in debt funds totaling $33.2\nmillion and $29.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company was a primary beneficiary in only\none of its joint venture investments, which was acquired in 2023 for $11.0 million. Results from the remaining entities\nhave not been consolidated in any year and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is\nobligated to make additional investments over the next several years. There was an obligation of $4.0 million and $3.5\nmillion reflected in the investment balance at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 12: Variable Interest\nEntities (VIEs) for additional information about VIE’s.\nOther items included in other assets and receivables on the consolidated balance sheets are disclosed elsewhere,\nor are not individually significant.\nNote 12: Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct\nactivities or hold assets generally that either:\n• Does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about\nthe entity’s activities through those voting rights or similar rights; or\n• Has equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without\nadditional subordinated financial support.\nThe Company has invested in single-family, multi-family, and healthcare debt financing entities, as well as\nlow-income housing syndicated funds that are deemed to be VIEs. The Company also has deemed as VIEs, a REMIC\ntrust that was established in conjunction with the September 2022 multi-family loan sale and securitization transaction,\nas well as a second REMIC trust that was established in December 2023 with a related party in conjunction with a loan\nsale and securitization. Accordingly, the entities were assessed for potential consolidation under the VIE model that\nrequires primary beneficiaries to consolidate the entity’s results. A primary beneficiary is defined as the party that has\nboth the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity, and an interest that could be significant to\nthe entity. To determine if an interest could be significant to the entity, both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding\nthe nature, size and form of involvement with the entity are evaluated.\nAt December 31, 2023 the Company determined it was not the primary beneficiary for most of its VIEs,\nprimarily because the Company did not have the obligation to absorb losses or the rights to receive benefits from the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Evaluation and assessment of VIEs for consolidation is performed\non an ongoing basis by management. Any changes in facts and circumstances occurring since the previous primary\nbeneficiary determination will be considered as part of this ongoing assessment.\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss associated with its unconsolidated VIEs consists of the capital\ninvested plus any unfunded equity commitments. These investments are recorded in other assets and other liabilities on\nour consolidated balance sheet.\nThe table below reflects the size of the VIEs as well as our maximum exposure to loss in connection with VIEs\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022. The totals in the table do not include bridge loans. Please see Note 20: Related Party\nTransactions for additional information. The Company also has bridge loans to unrelated parties totaling $141.0 million\nat December 31, 2023 associated with low-income housing tax credit investments, which represents the Company’s\nmaximum exposure to loss.\n107\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nTotal Total Maximum\nAssets ($ in thousands) Assets Liabilities Exposure to Loss\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nLow-income housing credit investments $ 118,741 $ 35,099 $ 118,741\nDebt funds 33,221 2,752 33,221\nTotal Unconsolidated VIEs $ 151,962 $ 37,851 $ 151,962\nDecember 31, 2022\nLow-income housing credit investments 22,310 22,043 22,310\nDebt funds 29,815 3,521 29,815\nTotal Unconsolidated VIEs $ 52,125 $ 25,564 $ 52,125\nIn addition to the table above, the Company is also involved with a VIE in a REMIC trust that was established\nin September 2022 in conjunction with a loan sale and securitization.

The repayment of principal on the notes is linked to\nan approximately $1.1 billion reference pool of loans originated under the Bank’s healthcare commercial real estate\nlending program, but the notes are not secured by the loans. The notes provide periodic payments of interest in addition\nto payment of principal over the life of the note and these values are tied to the performance of the loans. Therefore, the\nnotes effectively transfer credit risk in excess of the first 1% of losses on the reference pool of loans. The reduction in\nrisk weighted assets provides additional balance sheet capacity and benefits capital ratios for additional growth in the\nexisting loan pipeline. The Company maintains the ACL associated with the loans in the reference pool on the\nCompany’s balance sheet.\nThe notes accrue interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 15.50% and interest pays monthly.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly\nadditional discretionary, actions by federal and state banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material\neffect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for\nprompt corrective action, the Company, Merchants Bank, and FMBI must meet specific capital guidelines that involve\nquantitative measures of the Company’s, Merchants Bank’s, and FMBI’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.

Fair value measurements must maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be\nused to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;\nquoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated\nby observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of\nthe assets or liabilities\n118\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecurring Measurements\nThe following tables present the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities recognized in the\naccompanying balance sheets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in\nwhich the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nF air Value Meas ur e ments Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nFair Assets Inputs Inputs\nAssets Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nMortgage loans in process of securitization $ 110,599 $ — $ 110,599 $ —\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes 128,968 128,968 — —\nFederal agencies 247,755 — 247,755 —\nMortgage-backed - Agency 14,467 — 14,467 —\nMortgage-backed - Non-agency residential - fair value\noption 485,500 — — 485,500\nMortgage-backed - Agency - fair value option 236,997 — 236,997\nLoans held for sale 86,663 — 86,663 —\nServicing rights 158,457 — — 158,457\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate lock commitments 140 — — 140\nForward contracts 4 — 4 —\nInterest rate swaps 2,610 — 2,610 —\nInterest rate swaps (back-to-back) 12,426 — 12,426 —\nPut options 25,877 — 7,223 18,654\nInterest rate floors 6,576 — — 6,576\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate lock commitments 4 — — 4\nForward contracts 391 — 391 —\nInterest rate swaps (back-to-back) 12,426 — 12,426 —\nDecember 31, 2022\nMortgage loans in process of securitization $ 154,194 $ — $ 154,194 $ —\nSecurities available for sale:\nTreasury notes 36,280 36,280 — —\nFederal agencies 271,890 — 271,890 —\nMortgage-backed - Agency 15,167 — 15,167 —\nLoans held for sale 82,192 — 82,192 —\nServicing rights 146,248 — — 146,248\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate lock commitments 28 — — 28\nForward contracts 46 — 46 —\nInterest rate swaps 3,030 — 3,030 —\nInterest rate swaps (back-to-back) 3,041 — 3,041 —\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate lock commitments 23 — — 23\nForward contracts 52 — 52 —\nInterest rate swaps (back-to-back) 3,041 — 3,041 —\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets\n119\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\npursuant to the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to\ndevelop the reported fair value is described below.\nMortgage Loans in Process of Securitization, Securities Available for Sale, and Securities with a Fair Value Option\nElection\nWhere quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities such as U.S. Treasuries are classified\nwithin Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by\nusing quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing models, the\ninputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are\nclassified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy including federal agencies, mortgage-backed securities, municipal\nsecurities and Federal Housing Administration participation certificates. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs\nare not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nLoans Held for Sale\nCertain loans held for sale at fair value are saleable into the secondary mortgage markets and their fair values\nare estimated using observable quoted market or contracted prices, or market price equivalents, which would be used by\nother market participants. These saleable loans are considered Level 2.\nServicing Rights\nServicing rights do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, fair value is\nestimated using discounted cash flow models having significant inputs of discount rate, prepayment speed, cost of\nservicing, interest rates, and default rate. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, servicing rights are classified within\nLevel 3 of the hierarchy.\nThe Chief Financial Officer’s (CFO) office contracts with an independent pricing specialist to generate fair\nvalue estimates on a quarterly basis. The CFO’s office challenges the reasonableness of the assumptions used and\nreviews the methodology to ensure the estimated fair value complies with accounting standards generally accepted in the\nUnited States.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nInterest rate lock commitments - The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate lock commitments based\non the value of the underlying mortgage loan, quoted mortgage-backed security prices, estimates of the fair value of the\nservicing rights, and an estimate of the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the interest rate\nlock commitment, net of expenses. With respect to its interest rate lock commitments, management determined that a\nLevel 3 classification was most appropriate based on the various significant unobservable inputs utilized in estimating\nthe fair value of its interest rate lock commitments.\nForward sales commitments - The Company estimates the fair value of forward sales commitments based on\nmarket quotes of mortgage-backed security prices for securities similar to the ones used, which are considered Level 2.\nInterest rate swaps – The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swaps based on prices that are\nobtained from a third party that uses observable market inputs, thereby supporting a Level 2 classification.\nPut options - The fair value of put options are linked to securities available for sale that are accounted for using\nthe fair value option and are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 on the hierarchy. The put options are classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy, depending upon the magnitude of observable inputs in the valuation of the\nsecurities. These valuations are estimated by a third party.\nInterest rate floors - The fair value of interest rate floors is linked to securities available for sale that are\naccounted for using the fair value option. The value of the interest rate floors is based on estimated discounted cash\n120\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nflows that are based on inputs that are not readily observable and, thus, are classified as Level 3 on the hierarchy. These\nvaluations are estimated a third party.\nChanges in fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are recognized through noninterest\nincome and/or noninterest expenses on its consolidated statement of income.\nLevel 3 Reconciliation\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of recurring fair value measurements\nrecognized in the accompanying balance sheets using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs:\nY ear En ded December 3 1,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nServicing rights\nBalance, beginning of period $ 146,248 $ 110,348 $ 82,604\nAdditions\nPurchased servicing 513 — 2,057\nOriginated servicing 14,755 27,124 30,421\nSubtractions\nPaydowns (7,621) (10,985) (16,691)\nSales of servicing — — (438)\nChanges in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs or\nassumptions used in the valuation model 4,562 19,761 12,395\nBalance, end of period $ 158,457 $ 146,248 $ 110,348\nAvailable for sale securities - Mortgage-backed - Non-Agency\nresidential - fair value option\nBalance, beginning of period $ — $ — $ —\nPurchased securities 483,906 — —\nChanges in fair value 1,594 — —\nBalance, end of period $ 485,500 $ — $ —\nDerivative Assets - put options\nBalance, beginning of period $ — $ — $ —\nPurchases 20,248 — —\nChanges in fair value (1,594) — —\nBalance, end of period $ 18,654 $ — $ —\nDerivative Assets - interest rate floors\nBalance, beginning of period $ — $ — $ —\nPurchases 6,576 — —\nBalance, end of period $ 6,576 $ — $ —\nDerivative Assets - interest rate lock commitments\nBalance, beginning of period $ 28 $ 264 $ 6,131\nChanges in fair value 112 (236) (5,867)\nBalance, end of period $ 140 $ 28 $ 264\nDerivative Liabilities - interest rate lock commitments\nBalance, beginning of period $ 23 $ 41 $ —\nChanges in fair value (19) (18) 41\nBalance, end of period $ 4 23 $ 41\n121\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNonrecurring Measurements\nThe following table presents the fair value measurement of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nand the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFair Value Mea su re ments Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nFair Assets Inputs Inputs\nAssets Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nImpaired loans (collateral-dependent) $ 47,026 $ — $ — $ 47,026\nDecember 31, 2022\nImpaired loans (collateral-dependent) $ 4,465 $ — $ — $ 4,465\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying balance sheet, as well as the general classification of such assets\npursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to\ndevelop the reported fair value is described below.\nCollateral Dependent Loans, Net of ACL-Loans\nThe estimated fair value of collateral dependent loans is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less\nestimated cost to sell. Collateral dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then\nconsiders other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral\nunderlying collateral dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined to be collateral-dependent and\nsubsequently as deemed necessary by the Chief Credit Officer’s (“CCO”) office. Appraisals and evaluations are\nreviewed for accuracy and consistency by the CCO’s office. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers\nmaintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and\nestimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts\nand estimates are developed by the CCO’s office by comparison to historical results.\n122\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nUnobservable (Level 3) Inputs:\nThe following table presents quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in recurring and\nnonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements other than goodwill.\nValuation Weighted\nFair Value Technique Unobservable Inputs Range Average\n(In thousands)\nAt December 31, 2023:\nAvailable for sale securities -\nMortgage-backed - Non-Agency\nresidential - fair value option $ 485,500 Discounted cash flow Market credit spread 2% 2%\nCollateral dependent loans $ 47,026 Market comparable properties Marketability discount 0% - 100% 2%\nServicing rights - Multi-family $ 122,218 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 8% - 13% 9%\nConstant prepayment rate 0% - 50% 7%\nServicing rights - Single-family $ 30,959 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 10% - 11% 10%\nConstant prepayment rate 6% - 16% 7%\nServicing rights - SBA $ 5,280 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 16% 16%\nConstant prepayment rate 3% - 14% 9%\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate lock commitments $ 140 Discounted cash flow Loan closing rates 45% - 99% 78%\nPut options $ 18,654 Intrinsic option value Market credit spread 2% 2%\nInterest rate floors $ 6,576 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 6%-7% 7%\nDerivative liabilities - interest rate\nlock commitments $ 4 Discounted cash flow Loan closing rates 45% - 99% 78%\nAt December 31, 2022:\nCollateral-dependent impaired loans $ 4,465 Market comparable properties Marketability discount 4% - 54% 5%\nServicing rights - Multi-family $ 111,690 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 8% - 13% 9%\nConstant prepayment rate 0% - 39% 8%\nServicing rights - Single-family $ 29,926 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 9% - 10% 9%\nConstant prepayment rate 7% - 10% 7%\nServicing rights - SBA $ 4,632 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 16% 16%\nConstant prepayment rate 3% - 12% 8%\nDerivative assets - interest rate lock\ncommitments $ 28 Discounted cash flow Loan closing rates 60% - 87% 77%\nDerivative liabilities - interest rate\nlock commitments $ 23 Discounted cash flow Loan closing rates 60% - 87% 77%\nSensitivity of Significant Unobservable Inputs\nThe following is a discussion of the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs, the interrelationships\nbetween those inputs and other unobservable inputs used in recurring fair value measurement, and of how those inputs\nmight magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement.\nSecurities Available for Sale with a Fair Value Option Election and Related Derivate Financial Instruments\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of certain securities available for sale\nand their related put options include market credit spreads that can be impacted by market conditions and drive a\nsignificant amount of a market participant’s valuation of the security and its related put option. The impact of changes\nto the unobservable inputs for the securities is mitigated by changes to the unobservable inputs for the put options, which\nare valued in opposite directions, so as to minimize the financial impact to the Company.\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the interest rate floor derivative\nassociated with certain securities available for sale include the discount rate that can have a significant impact on the\nvalue of the derivative. Another variable that affects the floor value is the forward interest curve, which is observable,\nbut changes with market conditions as interest rates and future interest rate expectations change.\n123\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nServicing Rights\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s servicing rights are\ndiscount rates and constant prepayment rates. These two inputs can drive a significant amount of a market participant’s\nvaluation of servicing rights. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate or assumed constant prepayment rates\nused to value servicing rights would decrease (increase) the value derived.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial\ninstruments not carried at fair value and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements\nfall at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF air Value Mea sur e ments Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Fair Assets Inputs Inputs\nAssets Value Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 584,422 $ 584,422 $ 584,422 $ — $ —\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell 3,349 3,349 — 3,349 —\nSecurities held to maturity 1,204,217 1,203,535 — 484,288 719,247\nFHLB stock 48,578 48,578 — 48,578 —\nLoans held for sale 3,058,093 3,058,093 — 3,058,093 —\nLoans receivable, net 10,127,801 10,088,468 — — 10,088,468\nInterest receivable 91,346 91,346 — 91,346 —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits 14,061,460 14,062,457 8,894,058 5,168,399 —\nShort-term subordinated debt 64,922 64,922 — 64,922 —\nFHLB advances 771,392 771,029 — 771,029 —\nOther borrowing 7,934 7,934 — 7,934 —\nCredit linked notes 119,879 119,878 — 119,878 —\nInterest payable 43,423 43,423 — 43,423 —\nDecember 31, 2022\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 226,164 $ 226,164 $ 226,164 $ — $ —\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell 3,464 3,464 — 3,464 —\nSecurities held to maturity 1,119,078 1,118,966 — 247,182 871,784\nFHLB stock 39,130 39,130 — 39,130 —\nLoans held for sale 2,828,384 2,828,384 — 2,828,384 —\nLoans receivable, net 7,426,858 7,431,731 — — 7,431,731\nInterest receivable 56,262 56,262 — 56,262 —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits 10,071,345 10,064,941 7,082,056 2,982,885 —\nShort-term subordinated debt 21,000 21,000 — 21,000 —\nFHLB advances 859,392 858,984 — 858,984 —\nOther borrowing 50,000 50,000 — 50,000 —\nInterest payable 23,384 23,384 — 23,384 —\n124\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 24: Significant Estimates and Concentrations\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require disclosure of certain\nsignificant estimates and current vulnerabilities due to certain concentrations. Estimates related to the provision and\nallowance for credit losses are reflected in the notes regarding loans and the allowance for credit losses on loans (Notes 1\nand 5). Estimates related to servicing rights are reflected in the notes on servicing rights and loan servicing (Notes 1 and\n7). Estimates related to fair values are reflected in the footnote regarding fair values (Note 23). Current vulnerabilities\ndue to certain concentrations of credit risk are discussed in the footnote on commitments, credit risk, and contingencies\n(Note 25). Other significant estimates and concentrations not discussed in those footnotes include:\nMortgage-backed Securities and Secondary Mortgage Market Programs\nThe Company is involved in government programs for issuing mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The\nobjective of these programs is to facilitate secondary market activities in order to provide funding for the multi-family\nmortgage market.\nThe Company is subject to cancellation of secondary mortgage market programs, rapid increases in general\ninterest rates, and competition associated with conventional mortgage programs. In addition, the Company could be\nresponsible for covering shortfalls in amounts due to investors for delinquencies or foreclosures. No amounts have been\nreported in the consolidated financial statements since management believes that no near term financial losses will be\nincurred and these MBS programs will not be significantly affected by the controlling regulatory bodies.\nLiquidity\nIn order to withstand rapidly changing market dynamics, the Company’s business model minimizes\nconcentration risk by having significant sources of liquidity. It emphasizes the origination and investment in floating rate\nloans that adjust when market interest rates change and thereby minimize the interest rate risk inherent in fixed rate loans\nthat lose value when rates rise, as they did during 2022 and most of 2023. The Company also conservatively matches the\nduration of assets and liabilities. Its most liquid assets are in cash, short-term investments, including interest-bearing\ndemand deposits, mortgage loans in process of securitization, loans held for sale, and warehouse repurchase agreements\nincluded in loans receivable. Taken together with its unused borrowing capacity of $6.0 billion, these totaled $10.6\nbillion, or 62% of its $17.0 billion total assets at December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 93% of\nMerchants’ loan portfolio reprices within 30 days.\nMajor Customer\nThe Company had no major customers whose business represented more than 10% of revenues during the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nNote 25: Commitments, Credit Risk, and Contingencies\nFinancial Instruments\nMerchants offers certain financial instruments, including commitments with contracts that contain credit risk to\nthe Company and others that are subject to certain performance criteria by the client and or cancellation by the\nCompany. Such commitments were as follows at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n125\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDece mbe r 3 1,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCommitments subject to credit risk:\nCommitments to extend credit $ 3,693,099 $ 3,293,847\nStandby letters of credit 129,655 108,312\nUnfunded warehouse repurchase agreements 135,819 146,932\nTotal commitments subject to credit risk $ 3,958,573 $ 3,549,091\nCommitments subject to certain performance criteria and cancellation:\nOutstanding commitments to originate loans $ 692,582 $ 1,042,497\nUnfunded construction draws 266,369 247,504\nUnfunded warehouse repurchase agreements and other lines of credit 2,783,916 3,183,257\nTotal commitments subject to certain performance criteria and cancellation $ 3,742,867 $ 4,473,258\nIncluded in the chart above are the following commitments that are subject to credit risk:\nCommitments to extend credit. These are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of\nany condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination\nclauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn\nupon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each\ncustomer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the\nCompany upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include\naccounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nStandby letters of credit. These instruments are irrevocable, conditional commitments issued by the Company\nor by another party on behalf of the Company, for a fee, to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and\nthey generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of\ncredit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers. The Company’s policy for\nobtaining collateral and/or guarantees and the nature thereof is generally the same as that involved extending\ncommitments to its customers. The Company has not been required to fund nor has it incurred any losses on any standby\nletter of credit commitment during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nIncluded in the chart above are the following commitments that are subject to certain performance criteria and\ncan be denied by the Company:\nOutstanding commitments to originate loans. The Company has entered into lending commitments with\ncustomers who have applied for loans that are awaiting closing. The customers must meet certain credit and\nunderwriting criteria before the Company is required to fund the loans. Closing and funding of the majority of these\nloans is contingent upon various performance criteria by the potential borrower and the commitment may be rescinded\nby the Company. The Company may also enter into a corresponding sales commitment if it is the Company’s intent to\nclose the loan and to sell the loan after closing.\nUnfunded construction draws. Through the Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment, the Company has made\ncommitments to fund certain FHA insured construction loans that are drawn upon throughout the construction period.\nThese commitments are subject to certain performance criteria and inspections throughout the project, and funding can\nbe denied by the Company. As construction draws are disbursed, the amounts are securitized and sold to Ginnie Mae,\nand the Company continues to service the loans.\nUnfunded warehouse repurchase agreements and other lines of credit. Through the Mortgage Warehousing\nsegment, the Company has repurchase agreements with its non-depository financial institution customers engaged in\nmortgage lending. Funds drawn on the warehouse repurchase agreements are used by the borrowers to fund the loans\nthey originate. The customers’ loans must meet certain credit and underwriting criteria before the Company will fund the\ndraw requests on the repurchase agreements, and the draw requests can be denied by the Company. The majority of the\nwarehouse repurchase agreements are unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\n126\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAllowance for credit losses – off-balance sheet credit exposures (ACL-OBCE). The ACL-OBCE is a\nliability account representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to\ncredit risk resulting from contractual obligations to extend credit such as those included in the categories above. No\nallowance is recognized if there is an unconditional right to cancel the obligation. The amount of the allowance\nrepresents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on unfunded commitments expected to be funded over\nthe contractual life of the commitment. The ACL-OBCE is adjusted through the income statement as a component of\nprovision for credit loss.\nRisk-Sharing Arrangements\nAs a Fannie Mae multifamily lender, Merchants assumes a limited portion of the risk of loss during the\nremaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that is sold to Fannie Mae. Under this loss sharing agreement,\nMerchants bears a risk of up to one-third of incurred losses resulting from borrower defaults. Accordingly, Merchants\nmaintained a reserve liability for this risk-sharing obligation of $0.8 million at December 31, 2023 and $0.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. There have been no loans in default during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nRepurchase Obligations\nCertain single-family loans sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac may require the Company to repurchase loans if\nit is determined that the Company did not adhere to underwriting guidelines required by these government-sponsored\nentities. There was a reserve for potential obligations in other liabilities on the balance sheet for $1.0 million and $0.9\nmillion at December 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIndemnification Agreements\nAs part of a Freddie Mac Q-Series Securitization transaction occurring in 2022, the Company established\nreserve liabilities in other liabilities on the balance sheet related to an indemnification agreement for potential loan\nlosses. The Company established a reserve for contingent financial guarantees, which had a balance of $1.2 million for\nboth December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company also established a non-contingent stand-by reserve, which had a\nbalance of $2.5 million for both December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 5: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on\nLoans for additional information on this transaction.\nUnconditional Investment Obligations\nThe Company is contractually obligated to provide additional capital funding to certain investments in low-\nincome housing tax credit limited partnerships and LLCs. There was an unfunded liability for these investments of $61.4\nmillion and $36.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the Company had an unfunded\nliability to invest in debt fund joint ventures for $4.0 million and $5.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Both liability accounts are recorded in other liabilities on balance sheet. See Note 11: Other Assets and\nReceivables for additional information on these investments and joint ventures.\nOther\nThe Company and its subsidiaries can be parties to various claims and proceedings arising in the normal course\nof business. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such\nproceedings and claims will not be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nNote 26: Segment Information\nOur Company’s business segments are defined as Multi-family Mortgage Banking, Mortgage Warehousing,\nand Banking. The reportable business segments are consistent with the internal reporting and evaluation of the principal\nlines of business of the Company. The Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment originates and services government\nsponsored mortgages for multi-family and healthcare facilities. It is also a fully integrated syndicator of low-income\n127\nMerchants Bancorp\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nhousing tax credit and debt funds. The Mortgage Warehousing segment funds agency eligible residential loans from the\ndate of origination or purchase, until the date of sale in the secondary market, as well as commercial loans to non-\ndepository financial institutions. The Banking segment provides a wide range of financial products and services to\nconsumers and businesses, including retail banking, commercial lending, agricultural lending, retail and correspondent\nresidential mortgage banking, and Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lending. The Other segment includes general\nand administrative expenses that provide services to all segments; internal funds transfer pricing offsets resulting from\nallocations to/from the other segments, certain elimination entries and investments in qualified affordable housing\nlimited partnerships or LLCs and certain debt funds. All operations are domestic.\nThe tables below present selected business segment financial information for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021.\nM ulti-family\nMortgage

release changes. The\nfollowing pronouncements and releases have been deemed to have the most applicability to the Company’s financial\nstatements:\nFASB ASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an ASU update that will require public entities’ disclosures, on an annual\nand interim basis, to include additional details on reportable segments so financial statement users may better understand\nan entity’s overall performance and assist in assessing potential future cash flows. The new guidance will require public\nentities to present information regarding significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) as well as details regarding segment’s profit and loss.\nThe updates in ASU 2023-07 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods for years beginning after December 15, 2024. An entity shall apply the ASU retrospectively to financial\nstatements for periods beginning after the effective date. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting\nthis new guidance but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of\noperations.\nFASB ASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an ASU update that will require public business entity’s disclosures to\ninclude a tabular tax rate reconciliation. The update will also require all public entities disclose income tax expense and\ntaxes paid broken down by federal, state, and foreign with a disaggregation for jurisdictions that exceed 5% of income\nfor taxes paid.\nThe updates in ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that it is able to collect the\ninformation it is required to disclose in the reports it files with the SEC, and to record, process, summarize and disclose\nthis information within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Based on their evaluation of the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures which took place as of December 31, 2023, the Chairman/CEO and CFO believe that\nthese controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the Company is able to collect, process and disclose the\ninformation it is required to disclose in the reports it files with the SEC within the required time periods.\nBased on the evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures by the Chairman/CEO and CFO;\nno changes occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Merchants Bancorp (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned under the supervision of the Company’s Chairman/CEO and CFO, and effected by the Company’s board of\ndirectors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. This process\nincludes those policies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that transactions of the Company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use\nor disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of\nhuman error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide\nreasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the\neffectiveness of internal control may vary over time.\nBecause of the inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well\ndesigned, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023, based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013),\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on such evaluation,\nwe have concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2023.\nFORVIS, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the Company’s internal\n133\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Their report expressed an unqualified opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nMerchants Bancorp\nCarmel, Indiana\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Merchants Bancorp’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nstatements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, and our report dated March 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as\nwe considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n134\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nFORVIS, LLP\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nMarch 12, 2024\nItem 9B.
