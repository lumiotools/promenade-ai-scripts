(NASDAQ: AXGN), a global leader in developing and marketing innovative surgical solutions for peripheral nerve injuries, today reported financial results and business highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n  * Third quarter revenue was $48.6 million, a 17.9% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, gross margin decreased to 74.9%, down from 76.8% in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net loss for the quarter was $1.9 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted net income for the quarter was $3.1 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to adjusted net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million for the quarter, compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The balance of all cash, cash equivalents, and investments on September 30, 2024, was $30.5 million, as compared to a balance of $27.1 million on June 30, 2024\n\n\n\n“We are pleased with the third quarter’s topline revenue and EBITDA growth. Notably, our revenue performance in the quarter was broad based across our entire portfolio of nerve repair and protection applications, reflecting improved sales productivity and commercial execution,” commented Michael Dale, CEO and Director of Axogen, Inc. “Since joining the Axogen team, everything I’ve observed and experienced reaffirms my estimation that we have significant undeveloped potential to make nerve repair an expected standard of care around the world.”\n\n**Summary of Business Highlights**\n\n  * On November 1st, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified the company that they accepted the filing of its Biologics License Application (BLA) for Avance Nerve Graft® under a standard review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of September 5th, 2025. The FDA further indicated that it does not currently plan to hold an advisory committee for the application.\n  * During the quarter, at the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH), we presented novel data highlighting the extent of nerve damage that occurs in common injuries, the importance of protection of the nerve coaptation site and the growing role of Avance Nerve Graft in sensory, mixed and motor nerve repair.\n  * Recently, we executed on a National Resensation Breast program as well as numerous regional surgeon education programs in Extremities and Head & Neck. \n\n\n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nWe are maintaining our full year revenue guidance in the range of $182 million to $186 million, and now expect to be at the high end of our 74-76% full year gross margin range. Additionally, we reiterate that we expect to be net cash flow positive cumulatively for the period from April 1st through year end.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast for the investment community today at 8:00 a.m. ET.

Axogen employees are passionate about helping to restore peripheral nerve function and quality of life to patients with physical damage or transection to peripheral nerves by providing innovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and health care providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve, or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves, can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.\n\nAxogen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products used across various applications and surgical specialties, including traumatic injuries, oral and maxillofacial surgery, breast reconstruction, and the surgical treatment of pain. These applications encompass both scheduled and emergent procedures. Specifically, scheduled procedures are often pursued by patients seeking relief from conditions caused by a nerve defect or previous surgical interventions. Such procedures include providing sensation for women undergoing breast reconstruction following a mastectomy, nerve reconstruction after the surgical removal of painful neuromas, and oral and maxillofacial procedures, as well as nerve decompression. Conversely, emergent procedures typically arise from injuries that initially present in an emergency room, with specialists intervening either immediately or within a few days following the initial injury. This broad range of applications underscores Axogen’s vital role in addressing diverse patient needs in peripheral nerve repair.\n\nAxogen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products, including Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site; Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix (ECM) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves; Axoguard Nerve Protector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments; Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, a porcine submucosa ECM base layer coated with a proprietary hyaluronate-alginate gel, a next-generation technology designed to enhance nerve gliding and provide short- and long-term protection for peripheral nerve injuries; Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix TM, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used to protect and separate tissues in the surgical bed during the critical phase of tissue repair; and Axoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma. The Axogen portfolio of products is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and several other European and international countries.\n\nFor more information, visit www.axogeninc.com.\n\n**Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking****Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events, or results based on various assumptions and management's estimates of trends and economic factors in the markets in which we are active, as well as our business plans. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “continue,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “goals,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the estimation of significant undeveloped potential to make nerve repair an expected standard of care around the world, the Company's expectations regarding the potential for approval of the BLA in September 2025, as well as statements under the subheading “2024 Financial Guidance.” Actual results or events could differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, global supply chain issues, hospital staffing issues, product development, product potential, clinical outcomes, regulatory process and approvals, financial performance, sales growth, surgeon and product adoption, market awareness of our products, data validation, our visibility at and sponsorship of conferences and educational events, global business disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions, recent geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, potential disruptions due to management transitions, as well as those risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recently ended fiscal year and in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. The forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they are made and, except as required by applicable law, we assume no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, which measures earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA which further excludes non-cash stock compensation expense and litigation and related expenses. We also use the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Income or Loss and Adjusted Net Income or Loss Per Common Share - basic and diluted which excludes non-cash stock compensation expense and litigation and related expenses from Net Loss and Net Loss Per Common Share - basic and diluted, respectively. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business, the Company’s cash available for operations, and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements.\n\nContact:Axogen, Inc.InvestorRelations@axogeninc.com\n\n**​AXOGEN, INC.Condensed Consolidated Balance

(NASDAQ: AXGN), a global leader in developing and marketing innovative surgical solutions for peripheral nerve injuries, today reported financial results and business highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n  * Third quarter revenue was $48.6 million, a 17.9% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, gross margin decreased to 74.9%, down from 76.8% in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net loss for the quarter was $1.9 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted net income for the quarter was $3.1 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to adjusted net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million for the quarter, compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The balance of all cash, cash equivalents, and investments on September 30, 2024, was $30.5 million, as compared to a balance of $27.1 million on June 30, 2024\n\n\n\n“We are pleased with the third quarter’s topline revenue and EBITDA growth. Notably, our revenue performance in the quarter was broad based across our entire portfolio of nerve repair and protection applications, reflecting improved sales productivity and commercial execution,” commented Michael Dale, CEO and Director of Axogen, Inc. “Since joining the Axogen team, everything I’ve observed and experienced reaffirms my estimation that we have significant undeveloped potential to make nerve repair an expected standard of care around the world.”\n\n**Summary of Business Highlights**\n\n  * On November 1st, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified the company that they accepted the filing of its Biologics License Application (BLA) for Avance Nerve Graft® under a standard review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of September 5th, 2025. The FDA further indicated that it does not currently plan to hold an advisory committee for the application.\n  * During the quarter, at the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH), we presented novel data highlighting the extent of nerve damage that occurs in common injuries, the importance of protection of the nerve coaptation site and the growing role of Avance Nerve Graft in sensory, mixed and motor nerve repair.\n  * Recently, we executed on a National Resensation Breast program as well as numerous regional surgeon education programs in Extremities and Head & Neck. \n\n\n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nWe are maintaining our full year revenue guidance in the range of $182 million to $186 million, and now expect to be at the high end of our 74-76% full year gross margin range. Additionally, we reiterate that we expect to be net cash flow positive cumulatively for the period from April 1st through year end.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast for the investment community today at 8:00 a.m. ET. Investors interested in participating in the conference call by phone may do so by dialing toll free at (877) 407-0993 or use the direct dial-in number at (201) 689-8795.

Axogen employees are passionate about helping to restore peripheral nerve function and quality of life to patients with physical damage or transection to peripheral nerves by providing innovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and health care providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve, or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves, can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.\n\nAxogen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products used across various applications and surgical specialties, including traumatic injuries, oral and maxillofacial surgery, breast reconstruction, and the surgical treatment of pain. These applications encompass both scheduled and emergent procedures. Specifically, scheduled procedures are often pursued by patients seeking relief from conditions caused by a nerve defect or previous surgical interventions. Such procedures include providing sensation for women undergoing breast reconstruction following a mastectomy, nerve reconstruction after the surgical removal of painful neuromas, and oral and maxillofacial procedures, as well as nerve decompression. Conversely, emergent procedures typically arise from injuries that initially present in an emergency room, with specialists intervening either immediately or within a few days following the initial injury. This broad range of applications underscores Axogen’s vital role in addressing diverse patient needs in peripheral nerve repair.\n\nAxogen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products, including Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site; Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix (ECM) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves; Axoguard Nerve Protector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments; Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, a porcine submucosa ECM base layer coated with a proprietary hyaluronate-alginate gel, a next-generation technology designed to enhance nerve gliding and provide short- and long-term protection for peripheral nerve injuries; Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix TM, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used to protect and separate tissues in the surgical bed during the critical phase of tissue repair; and Axoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma. The Axogen portfolio of products is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and several other European and international countries.\n\nFor more information, visit www.axogeninc.com.\n\n**Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking****Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events, or results based on various assumptions and management's estimates of trends and economic factors in the markets in which we are active, as well as our business plans. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “continue,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “goals,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the estimation of significant undeveloped potential to make nerve repair an expected standard of care around the world, the Company's expectations regarding the potential for approval of the BLA in September 2025, as well as statements under the subheading “2024 Financial Guidance.” Actual results or events could differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, global supply chain issues, hospital staffing issues, product development, product potential, clinical outcomes, regulatory process and approvals, financial performance, sales growth, surgeon and product adoption, market awareness of our products, data validation, our visibility at and sponsorship of conferences and educational events, global business disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions, recent geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, potential disruptions due to management transitions, as well as those risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recently ended fiscal year and in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. The forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they are made and, except as required by applicable law, we assume no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, which measures earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA which further excludes non-cash stock compensation expense and litigation and related expenses. We also use the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Income or Loss and Adjusted Net Income or Loss Per Common Share - basic and diluted which excludes non-cash stock compensation expense and litigation and related expenses from Net Loss and Net Loss Per Common Share - basic and diluted, respectively. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business, the Company’s cash available for operations, and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements.\n\nContact:Axogen, Inc.InvestorRelations@axogeninc.com\n\n**​AXOGEN, INC.Condensed Consolidated Balance

Notably, our\nrevenue performance in the quarter was broad based across our entire portfolio of nerve\nrepair and protection applications, reflecting improved sales productivity and commercial\nexecution,” commented Michael Dale, CEO and Director of Axogen, Inc. “Since joining the\nAxogen team, everything I’ve observed and experienced reaffirms my estimation that we\nhave significant undeveloped potential to make nerve repair an expected standard of care\naround the world.”\nSummary of Business Highlights\nOn November 1st, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified the company\nthat they accepted the filing of its Biologics License Application (BLA) for Avance\nNerve Graft® under a standard review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act\n(PDUFA) goal date of September 5th, 2025.

Axogen\nemployees are passionate about helping to restore peripheral nerve function and quality of\nlife to patients with physical damage or transection to peripheral nerves by providing\ninnovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and\nhealth care providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory\nsignals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical\nprocedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a\nperipheral nerve, or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves, can result in the\nloss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.\nAxogen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products\nused across various applications and surgical specialties, including traumatic injuries, oral\nand maxillofacial surgery, breast reconstruction, and the surgical treatment of pain. These\napplications encompass both scheduled and emergent procedures. Specifically, scheduled\nprocedures are often pursued by patients seeking relief from conditions caused by a nerve\ndefect or previous surgical interventions. Such procedures include providing sensation for\nwomen undergoing breast reconstruction following a mastectomy, nerve reconstruction after\nthe surgical removal of painful neuromas, and oral and maxillofacial procedures, as well as\nnerve decompression. Conversely, emergent procedures typically arise from injuries that\ninitially present in an emergency room, with specialists intervening either immediately or\nwithin a few days following the initial injury. This broad range of applications underscores\nAxogen’s vital role in addressing diverse patient needs in peripheral nerve repair.\nAxogen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products,\nincluding Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve\nallograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a\nsecond surgical site; Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix\n(ECM) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves; Axoguard Nerve\nProtector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged\nperipheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue\nattachments; Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, a porcine submucosa ECM base layer\ncoated with a proprietary hyaluronate-alginate gel, a next-generation technology designed to\nenhance nerve gliding and provide short- and long-term protection for peripheral nerve\ninjuries; Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix TM, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used to\nprotect and separate tissues in the surgical bed during the critical phase of tissue repair; and\nAxoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral\nnerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the\ndevelopment of symptomatic or painful neuroma. The Axogen portfolio of products is\navailable in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and several other\nEuropean and international countries.\nFor more information, visit www.axogeninc.com.\nCautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current\nexpectations or predictions of future conditions, events, or results based on various\nassumptions and management's estimates of trends and economic factors in the markets in\nwhich we are active, as well as our business plans. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,”\n“intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “continue,” “may,”\n“should,” “will,” “goals,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to\nidentify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without\nlimitation, the estimation of significant undeveloped potential to make nerve repair an\nexpected standard of care around the world, the Company's expectations regarding the\npotential for approval of the BLA in September 2025, as well as statements under the\nsubheading “2024 Financial Guidance.” Actual results or events could differ materially from\nthose described in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including,\nwithout limitation, global supply chain issues, hospital staffing issues, product development,\nproduct potential, clinical outcomes, regulatory process and approvals, financial\nperformance, sales growth, surgeon and product adoption, market awareness of our\nproducts, data validation, our visibility at and sponsorship of conferences and educational\nevents, global business disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related\nsanctions, recent geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, potential disruptions due to\nmanagement transitions, as well as those risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk\nFactors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recently ended fiscal year and in\nour subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q. Forward-looking statements are not a\nguarantee of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those\nprojected. The forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they are\nmade and, except as required by applicable law, we assume no responsibility to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures of EBITDA, which measures earnings before interest, income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA which further excludes non-cash stock\ncompensation expense and litigation and related expenses. We also use the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures of Adjusted Net Income or Loss and Adjusted Net Income or Loss Per\nCommon Share - basic and diluted which excludes non-cash stock compensation expense\nand litigation and related expenses from Net Loss and Net Loss Per Common Share - basic\nand diluted, respectively. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive\nset of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different\nfrom non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures\nshould be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. The reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable\nfinancial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP should be carefully\nevaluated.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making\nand as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance\nand that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing\nfuture periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by\nmanagement in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our\ninstitutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of\nour business, the Company’s cash available for operations, and the Company’s ability to\nmeet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements.\nContact:\nAxogen, Inc.\nInvestorRelations@axogeninc.com\n​AXOGEN, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\n$ 18,662 $ 31,024\nCash and cash equivalents\nRestricted cash 6,000 6,002\nInvestments 5,868 —\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $888 and $337, respectively 24,629 25,147\nInventory, net 29,363 23,020\nPrepaid expenses and other 1,730 2,811\nTotal current assets 86,252 88,004\nProperty and equipment, net 85,632 88,730\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 14,886 15,562\nIntangible assets, net 5,215 4,531\nTotal assets $ 191,985 $ 196,827\nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 21,177 $ 28,883\nCurrent maturities of long-term lease obligations 1,856 1,547\nTotal current liabilities 23,033 30,430\nLong-term debt, net of debt discount and financing fees 47,272 46,603\nLong-term lease obligations 19,734 21,142\nDebt derivative liabilities 2,445 2,987\nOther long-term liabilities 94 —\nTotal liabilities 92,578 101,162\nCommitments and contingencies -

statements.\n\n6\n\nAxogen, Inc.\n\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n\n1.Nature of Business\n\nAxogen, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was incorporated in Minnesota. Our business is focused on the science, development and commercialization of the technologies used for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. The Company's products include Avance® Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector®,Axoguard Nerve Protector®,Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, Axoguard Nerve Cap®, Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix™, andAxotouch® Two-Point Discriminator. The Company is headquartered in Florida. The Company has processing, warehousing, and distribution facilities in Texas and Ohio.\n\nThe Company manages its operations as a single operating segment. Substantially all of the Company's assets are maintained in the United States. The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from sales to customers in the United States.\n\n2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPlease see Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 5, 2024, for a description of all significant accounting policies.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information to conform to the presentation used in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nEffective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company voluntarily changed its accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. Under the new accounting policy, these costs are included in Costs of goods sold, whereas they were previously included in Sales and marketing expenses. Including these expenses in Costs of goods sold better aligns these costs with the related revenue in the gross profit calculation. Although the prior method of accounting continues to be an accepted alternative, the new accounting policy is more widely used in the industry and provides improved comparability of the Company's financial statements to its peers. This change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively. The consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, has been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy. The impact of this reclassification was an increase of $1,460 and $4,204 to Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and a corresponding decrease to Sales and marketing expenses in the same periods. \n\nEffective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company also ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously such costs had been allocated based on the Company’s estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to Cost of goods sold, Sales and marketing, Research and development, and General and administrative. The Company determined that these changes would better reflect industry practice and would provide more meaningful information as well as increased transparency of its operations. To conform the 2023 presentation to the current quarter and year to date presentation, $1,035 and $3,019 was reclassified to General and administrative, of which $295 and $867 was previously included in Research and development, $803 and $2,209 was previously included in Sales and marketing, and $63 and $58 was previously included in Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\nThese reclassifications had no impact on net revenue, loss from operations, net loss, or loss per common share for prior periods and do not represent a restatement of the Company's previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X, and; therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the \n\n7\n\nCompany for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited, and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of results for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year due primarily to the impact of the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may impact the Company's markets for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Concentration\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Certain of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balances exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insured limits or are invested in money market accounts with investment banks that are not FDIC-insured. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents in what they believe to be credit-worthy financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, $18,162 of the cash and cash equivalents balance was in excess of FDIC limits. \n\nRestricted Cash \n\nAmounts included in restricted cash represent those required to be set aside to meet contractual terms of a lease agreement held by the Company. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees, Other Credit Facilities.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 18,662 | $| 31,024  \nRestricted cash| 6,000 | 6,002  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows| $| 24,662 | $| 37,026  \n  \nGovernment Assistance\n\nAs there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP for accounting for grants to for-profit business entities, the Company accounts for the grants by analogy to International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance (\"IAS 20\"). Government assistance and grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company has met the requirements of the assistance and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. The Company received government grants of $378 and $— for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $544 and $155 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.\n\nShipping and Handling \n\nAll shipping and handling costs, including facility and warehousing overhead, directly related to bringing the Company’s products to their final selling destination are included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs for products shipped to customers as a fulfillment activity as the costs are incurred as part of the transfer of the goods to the customer in accordance with ASC 606. See Reclassifications above.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nAll other Accounting Standards Updates (\"ASU's\") issued and not yet effective as of September 30, 2024, and through the date of this report, were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company’s current or future financial position or results of operations except for the following:\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update 2023-09 — Income Taxes (Topic 740) — Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The new guidance provides for \n\n8\n\ndisclosure on an annual basis of the following: (i) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold of greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate. The amendment in ASU 2023-09 is effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to enhance annual income tax reporting disclosures based on the new requirements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2023-07 — Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"). The new guidance requires disclosure on an annual and interim basis of the following: (i) significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") and a measure of segment profit or loss; (ii) an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition; (iii) all annual disclosures about a reportable segment's profit and loss and assets as currently required by Topic 280; (iv) clarify if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources; and (v) disclose title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses the reported measures. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by this amendment. The amendment in ASU 2023-07 is effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for the quarters in the years after December 15, 2024, early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to enhance annual segment reporting disclosures based on the new requirements.\n\n3.

The carrying value and fair value of the Credit Facility were $47,272 and $51,274 at September 30, 2024, and $46,603 and $51,486 at December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees.\n\nThe debt derivative liabilities are measured using a ‘with and without’ valuation model to compare the fair value of each tranche of the Credit Facility including the identified embedded derivative features and the fair value of a plain vanilla note with the same terms. The fair value of the Credit Facility including the identified embedded derivative features was determined \n\n12\n\nusing a probability-weighted expected return model based on four potential settlement scenarios, one of which ended December 31, 2023, for the financing agreement as disclosed in the table below. The estimated settlement value of each scenario, which would include any required make-whole payment, (see Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees), is then discounted to present value using a discount rate that is derived based on the initial terms of the financing agreement at issuance and corroborated utilizing a synthetic credit rating analysis.\n\nThe significant inputs that are included in the valuation of the debt derivative liability - first tranche include:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nInput  \nRemaining term (years)| 2.75 years| 3.5 years  \nMaturity date| June 30, 2027| June 30, 2027  \nCoupon rate| 9.5% - 13.0%| 9.5% - 13.2%  \nRevenue participation payments| Maximum each year| Maximum each year  \nDiscount rate| 11.56% | (1)| 12.06% | (1)  \nProbability of mandatory prepayment 2024 or after| 15.0 | %| (1)| 15.0 | %| (1)  \nEstimated timing of mandatory prepayment event 2024 or after| March 31, 2026| (1)| March 31, 2026| (1)  \nProbability of optional prepayment event| 5.0 | %| (1)| 5.0 | %| (1)  \nEstimated timing of optional prepayment event| December 31, 2025| (1)| December 31, 2025| (1)  \nProbability of note held-to-maturity(2)| 80.0% | (1)| 80.0% | (1)  \n  \n(1)Represents a significant unobservable input.\n\n(2) See Maturity date in table.\n\nThe significant inputs that are included in the valuation of the debt derivative liability - second tranche include:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nInput  \nRemaining term (years)| 3.75 years| 4.5 years  \nMaturity date| June 30, 2028| June 30, 2028  \nCoupon rate| 9.5% - 13.0%| 9.5% - 13.2%  \nRevenue participation payments| Maximum each year| Maximum each year  \nDiscount rate| 14.92 | %| (1)| 15.60 | %| (1)  \nProbability of mandatory prepayment 2024 or after| 15.0% | (1)| 15.0% | (1)  \nEstimated timing of mandatory prepayment event 2024 or after| March 31, 2026| (1)| March 31, 2026| (1)  \nProbability of optional prepayment event| 5.0% | (1)| 5.0% | (1)  \nEstimated timing of optional prepayment event| December 31, 2025| (1)| December 31, 2025| (1)  \nProbability of held-to-maturity(2)| 80.0% | 80.0%   \n  \n(1)Represents a significant unobservable input.\n\n(2)See Maturity date in table.\n\n13\n\n7.

The sublease commenced on August 1, 2024. The Company accounts for this sublease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases.\n\n14\n\n8. Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees\n\nLong-term debt, net of debt discount and financing fees consists of the following:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nCredit Facility - first tranche| $| 35,000 | $| 35,000  \nCredit Facility - second tranche| 15,000 | 15,000  \nLess - unamortized debt discount and deferred financing fees| (2,728)| (3,397)  \nLong-term debt, net of debt discount and financing fees| $| 47,272 | $| 46,603  \n  \nCredit Facility\n\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company amended its Credit Facility with Oberland Capital and its affiliates TPC Investments II LP and Argo LLC (collectively, the \"Lender\"). The term loan agreement for the Credit Facility was amended to transition the base interest rate from three-month LIBOR to Adjusted SOFR. The Company obtained the first tranche of $35,000 at closing on June 30, 2020. On June 30, 2021, the second tranche of $15,000 was drawn down by the Company. \n\nEach tranche under the Credit Facility requires quarterly interest payments for seven years. Interest is calculated as 7.5% plus the greater of Adjusted SOFR or 2.0% (12.9% at September 30, 2024), provided that the interest rate shall never be less than 9.5%. Each tranche of the Credit Facility has a term of seven years from the date of issuance (with the first tranche issued on June 30, 2020, maturing on June 30, 2027, and the second tranche issued on June 30, 2021, maturing on June 30, 2028). In connection with the Credit Facility, the Company entered into a revenue participation agreement (the “Revenue Participation Agreement”) with the Lender, which provided that, among other things, a quarterly royalty payment as a percentage of the Company’s net revenues, up to $70 million in any given year, after April 1, 2021, ending on the date upon which all amounts owed under the Credit Facility have been paid in full. This structure results in approximately 1.5% per year of additional interest payments on the outstanding loan amount. The Company recorded $0 as interest expense for this Revenue Participation Agreement for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and $756 for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Company pays the quarterly debt interest on the last day of the quarter and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, paid $1,652 and $1,642, respectively, and $4,917 and $4,776 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, to the Lender. The Company capitalized interest of $0 and $1,043 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $0 and $5,240 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, towards the costs to construct and retrofit the Axogen Processing Center (\"APC Facility\") in Vandalia, Ohio which was completed during 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.\n\nEmbedded Derivatives\n\nThe fair values of the debt derivative liabilities were $2,445 and $2,987 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 6 - Fair Value Measurement.\n\nUnamortized Debt Discount and Financing Fees\n\nThe unamortized debt discount consists of the remaining initial fair values of the embedded derivatives related to the Credit Facility.\n\nThe financing fees for the Credit Facility were $642 and were recorded as a contra liability to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAmortization of debt discount and deferred financing fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was $225 and $224, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was $669 and $666, respectively. \n\nOther Credit Facilities\n\nThe Company had restricted cash of $6,000 and $6,002 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively for an irrevocable standby letter of credit.\n\n15\n\n9. Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company's stock-based compensation plans are described in Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, the following stock compensation was awarded to officers and employees.

No inducement shares were issued in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense is as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nStock-based compensation expense| $| 5,004 | $| 4,747 | $| 12,830 | $| 13,091  \n  \n10. Net Loss Per Common Share\n\nThe following reflects the net loss attributable to common shareholders and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations using the two-class method:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(In thousands, except per share amounts)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss | $| (1,858)| $| (4,089)| $| (10,414)| $| (17,823)  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding (Basic)| 43,882,110 | 43,022,328 | 43,610,481 | 42,821,284  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding (Diluted)| 43,882,110 | 43,022,328 | 43,610,481 | 42,821,284  \nNet loss per common share (Basic and Diluted)| $| (0.04)| $| (0.10)| $| (0.24)| $| (0.42)  \nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (1)  \nStock options| 1,678,775 | 4,552,919 | 3,077,373 | 4,321,696  \nRestricted stock units| 319,136 | 1,391,717 | 513,975 | 373,794  \n  \n(1) These common equivalent shares are not included in the diluted per share calculations as they would be anti-dilutive if the Company was in a net income position.\n\n11. Income Taxes\n\nThe Company has no recorded income tax expense or income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 due to the generation of net operating losses, the benefits of which have been fully reserved. \n\nThe Company has not recorded current income tax expense due to the generation of net operating losses. Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A full valuation allowance has been established on the deferred tax asset as it is more likely than not that a future tax benefit will not be realized. In addition, future utilization of the available net operating loss carryforward may be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of changes in ownership.\n\nThe Company identifies and evaluates uncertain tax positions, if any, and recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions for which there is a less than more likely than not probability of the position being upheld when reviewed by the relevant tax authority. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company has not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company’s remaining open tax years subject to examination by federal tax authorities include the years ended December 31, 2019, through 2023, and we received a notice of examination from the federal tax authorities for tax year 2021 is currently under examination. For tax years 2005 through 2018, federal taxing authorities may examine and adjust loss carryforwards in the years in which those loss carryforwards are ultimately utilized.\n\n17\n\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nService Agreements\n\nThe Company pays Community Blood Center, (d/b/a Solvita), formerly d/b/a Community Tissue Service, (\"Solvita\") a facility fee for the use of clean rooms/manufacturing, storage, and office space and for services in support of its tissue processing including for routine sterilization of daily supplies, providing disposable supplies and microbial services, and office support. Pursuant to the Solvita Agreement, the Company recorded expenses of $233 and $600 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $706 and $1,911 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, is included in cost of goods sold. The Solvita Agreement was amended on June 30, 2024, extending the term through December 31, 2026. The Solvita Agreement may be terminated by either party by providing an eighteen-month written notice. The Company is continuing its use of Solvita for Avive+. \n\nDistribution and Supply Agreements\n\nIn August 2008, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Cook Biotech Incorporated (\"Cook Biotech\") to distribute the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products worldwide and the parties subsequently amended the agreement on August 4, 2023. The distribution agreement expires on December 31, 2030. The Cook Biotech agreement establishes a formula for the transfer cost of the Axoguard products and requires certain minimum purchases by the Company, although, through mutual agreement, the parties have not established such minimums; and, to date, have not enforced such provision. Under the Cook Biotech agreement, the Company provides purchase orders to Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech fulfills the purchase orders. The agreement allows for termination provisions for both parties. The loss of the ability to sell the Axoguardproducts could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business until other replacement products would be available.\n\nIn June 2017, the Company entered into the Nerve End Cap Supply Agreement (the \"Supply Agreement\") with Cook Biotech whereby Cook Biotech is the exclusive contract manufacturer of the Axoguard Nerve Cap; the parties subsequently amended the agreement on August 4, 2023. The Supply Agreement expires on December 31, 2030. The Supply Agreement establishes the terms and conditions in which Cook Biotech will manufacture the product for the Company. Under the Supply Agreement the Company provides purchase orders to Cook Biotech and Cook Biotech fulfills the purchase orders. The Supply Agreement allows for termination provisions for both parties. The loss of the Company's ability to sell the Axoguard Nerve Cap products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business until other replacement products would become available.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company entered into a Supply and Manufacturing Agreement (\"HA+ Supply Agreement\") with Cook Biotech whereby Cook Biotech is the exclusive contract manufacturer of the Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector. The HA+ Supply Agreement expires on July 1, 2030. The HA+ Supply Agreement establishes the terms and conditions in which Cook Biotech will manufacture, package, label and deliver the product to the Company. Under the HA+ Supply Agreement, the Company provides purchase orders to Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech fulfills the purchase orders. The HA+ Supply Agreement allows for termination provisions for both parties. The loss of the Company's ability to sell the Axoguard products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business until other replacement products would become available. On January 31, 2024, RTI Surgical, Inc. announced the acquisition of Cook Biotech. The acquisition of Cook Biotech has not had any material impact on our relationship with Cook Biotech or our operations.\n\nInsurance Finance Agreement\n\nWe finance certain of our commercial insurance policies (\"Insurance Financing Agreement\"). Outstanding payments owed under the Insurance Financing Agreement are recorded as \"prepaid expenses and other\" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amounts owed under the Insurance Financing Agreement included in prepaid expenses and other were $465 and $0 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. \n\nProcessing Facilities\n\nThe Company is highly dependent on the continued availability of its processing facilities at Solvita and APC in Dayton, Ohio and could be harmed if the physical infrastructure of these facilities is unavailable for any prolonged period of time. \n\nCertain Economic Development Grants\n\nThe Company obtained certain economic development grants from state and local authorities totaling up to $2,685 including $1,250 of cash grants to offset costs to acquire and develop the APC Facility. The economic development grants are subject to certain job creation milestones through December 31, 2023, and have clawback clauses if the Company does not \n\n18\n\nmeet the job creation milestones The Company requested an extension from the grant authorities to extend the job creation milestones and received approval to extend the evaluation date to December 31, 2024, and the expiration date to December 31, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has received $1,188 from the cash grants.\n\nFair Value of the Debt Derivative Liabilities \n\nThe fair value of the debt derivative liabilities is $2,445 as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the debt derivative liabilities is determined using a probability-weighted expected return model based upon four potential settlement scenarios, one of which ended December 31, 2023, with the Credit Facility. The estimated settlement value of each scenario, which includes any required make-whole payment, is discounted to present value using a discount rate that is derived based upon the initial terms of the Credit Facility at issuance and corroborated utilizing a synthetic rating analysis. The calculated fair values under the four scenarios are then compared to the fair value of a plain vanilla note, with the difference reflecting the fair value of the debt derivative liabilities. The Company estimated the make-whole payments required under each scenario according to the terms of the Credit Facility to generate an internal rate of return equal to 11.5% through the scheduled maturity dates, less the total of all quarterly interest and royalty payments previously paid to the Lender. The calculation utilized the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel as required by the Credit Facility. If the debt is not prepaid but instead is held to its scheduled maturities, the Company’s estimate of the make-whole payment for the first tranche and second tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2027, and June 30, 2028, respectively, are approximately zero. The Company has consistently applied this approach since the inception of the debt agreement on June 30, 2020.\n\nThe Company is aware that the Lender may have an alternative interpretation of the calculation of the make-whole payments that the Company believes does not properly utilize the same methodology utilized by the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel as described in the Credit Facility. The Company estimates the top end of the range of the make-whole payments if the debt is held to scheduled maturity under an alternative interpretation to be approximately $9,000 for the first tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2027, and approximately $4,000 for the second tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2028. Further, if the debt is prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity dates and subject to the alternative interpretation, the make-whole payment would be larger than the amounts herein. \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nThe Company is and may be subject to various claims, lawsuits, and proceedings in the ordinary course of the Company's business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingency involving the Company, in the opinion of management, such claims are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified, or are not expected individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material, adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies.\n\n19\n\nITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTSOF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts in the discussion and analysis, unless noted otherwise, are presented in thousands. \n\nFinancial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect the retrospective application of voluntary changes in the Company’s accounting policy for shipping and handling costs, as discussed under “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\n\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “Axogen,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Axogen, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries Axogen Corporation (“AC”), Axogen Processing Corporation, Axogen Europe GmbH and Axogen Germany GmbH.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe are the leading company focused specifically on the science, development, and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. We are passionate about providing the opportunity to restore nerve function and quality of life for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. We provide innovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and healthcare providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.\n\nProduct Portfolio \n\n•Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site. \n\n•Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine (pig) submucosa extracellular matrix (\"ECM\") coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves. \n\n•Axoguard Nerve Protector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments.\n\n•Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, is comprised of a processed porcine submucosa ECM base layer with a hyaluronate-alginate gel coating designed to provide short- and long-term protection for peripheral nerve injuries. The gel layer facilitates enhanced nerve gliding to aid in minimizing soft tissue attachments, while the base layer is remodeled into a long-term protective tissue layer. \n\n•Axoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma. \n\n•Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix™, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used to protect and separate tissues in the surgical bed during the critical phase of tissue healing.\n\n•Axotouch® Two-Point Discriminator, used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin.\n\nOur portfolio of products is currently available in the United States (\"U.S.\"), Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain and several other European, Asian and Latin American countries.\n\nRevenue from the distribution of our nerve repair products, Avance® Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector®, Axoguard Nerve Protector®, Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, Axoguard Nerve Cap® and Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix™, in the United States (\"U.S.\") is the main contributor to our total reported sales and have been the key component of our growth to date. \n\nOn June 24, 2024, we announced the full launch of Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix. Avive+ is processed and distributed in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and U.S. State regulations as a 361 human tissue product. Products regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act are a product category under close scrutiny by the FDA for \n\n20\n\ncompliance with the regulatory requirements and potentially subject to regulatory change in the future. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to potential compliance actions by the FDA or state regulators and could risk the commercial availability of the product.\n\nOur strategy remains focused on deepening our presence in high-potential accounts specifically, Level 1 trauma centers and academic-affiliated hospitals with a high number of trained micro-surgeons. We will drive growth in these accounts through targeted expansion of nerve repair indications, and driving deeper adoption of our Nerve Repair Algorithm across multiple surgical specialties.\n\nSummary of Operational and Business Highlights\n\n•We completed the BLA submission for Avance® Nerve Graft on September 6, 2024. On November 1, 2024 the FDA informed us that they had accepted the BLA for filing and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of September 5, 2024. The FDA further indicated that it does not currently plan to hold an advisory committee meeting for the application.\n\n•Revenues were $48,644 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $7,373 or 17.9% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n•Gross profit was $36,438 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $4,734 or 14.9% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n21\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and percentage of total revenue:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nAmount| % ofRevenue| Amount| % ofRevenue  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nRevenues| $| 48,644 | 100.0 | %| $| 41,271 | 100.0 | %  \nCost of goods sold| 12,206 | 25.1 | 9,567 | 23.2   \nGross profit| 36,438 | 74.9 | 31,704 | 76.8   \nCosts and expenses  \nSales and marketing| 18,924 | 38.9 | 19,165 | 46.4   \nResearch and development| 6,996 | 14.4 | 6,694 | 16.2   \nGeneral and administrative| 10,834 | 22.3 | 9,870 | 23.9   \nTotal costs and expenses| 36,754 | 75.6 | 35,729 | 86.6   \nLoss from operations| (316)| (0.6)| (4,025)| (9.8)  \nOther income (expense):  \nInvestment income| 296 | 0.6 | 367 | 0.9   \nRental income| 90 | 0.2 | — | —   \nInterest expense| (1,893)| (3.9)| (827)| (2.0)  \nChange in fair value of derivatives| 13 | — | 402 | 1.0   \nOther expense| (48)| (0.1)| (6)| —   \nTotal other expense net| (1,542)| (3.2)| (64)| (0.2)  \nNet loss| $| (1,858)| (3.8)| %| $| (4,089)| (9.9)| %  \n  \nRevenues\n\nRevenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $7,373 or 17.9% to $48,644 as compared to $41,271 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in unit volume of 7.7%, product mix of 6.0% and a 4.2% increase in prices.\n\nGross Profit\n\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $4,734 or 14.9% to $36,438 as compared to $31,704 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 74.9% and 76.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross margin is due to the change in our product mix.\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nTotal costs and expenses increased by $1,025 or 2.9% to $36,754 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $35,729 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in total costs and expenses was primarily due to compensation costs of $3,552 partially offset by a reduction in royalty fees of $930, R&D projects of $874, and marketing programs of $770.\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $241 or 1.3% to $18,924 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $19,165 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to royalty fees of $930, marketing programs of $770 and travel cost of $80, partially offset by increase in compensation costs of $1,495.\n\n22\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $302 or 4.5% to $6,996 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $6,694 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to product development, clinical expenses, as well as non-clinical expenses related to the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft. Product development expenses represented approximately 52% and 62% of total research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 48% and 38% of total research and development expense the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $964 or 9.8% to $10,834 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $9,870 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to compensation costs of $1,281 of which $695 was stock compensation related to the departure of the former CEO, bad debt expense of $350, and certain other cost of $133, partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $800.\n\nOther Income and Expense\n\nOther expense, net increased by $1,478 to $1,542 for thethree months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of $64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in other expense was due to an increase in interest expense of $1,066, and the change in the fair value of derivatives of $389.\n\nInterest expense increased by $1,066 to $1,893 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $827 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the completion of the APC facility in 2023 resulting in no additional interest expense being capitalized for that facility during 2024. We recognized total interest expense of $1,877 and $1,866 in connection with the Credit Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, of which $0 and $1,043 of this interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC Facility during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe had no income tax expense or benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to the incurrence of net operating losses in each of these periods, the benefits of which have a full valuation allowance. From time to time, we receive notices of examination of prior tax filings from federal and state authorities. We do not believe that there are currently any material outstanding tax expenses or benefits.\n\n23\n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and percentage of total revenue:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nAmount| % ofRevenue| Amount| % ofRevenue  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nRevenues| $| 137,933 | 100.0 | %| $| 116,090 | 100.0 | %  \nCost of goods sold| 33,531 | 24.3 | %| 26,242 | 22.6 | %  \nGross profit| 104,402 | 75.7 | %| 89,848 | 77.40 | %  \nCosts and expenses  \nSales and marketing| 58,437 | 42.4 | %| 57,471 | 49.5 | %  \nResearch and development| 21,063 | 15.3 | %| 20,164 | 17.4 | %  \nGeneral and administrative| 30,206 | 21.9 | %| 30,481 | 26.3 | %  \nTotal costs and expenses| 109,706 | 79.5 | %| 108,116 | 93.1 | %  \nLoss from operations| (5,304)| (3.8)| %| (18,268)| (15.74)  \nOther (expense) income:  \nInvestment income | 816 | 0.6 | %| 1,151 | 1.0 | %  \nRental income| 90 | 0.1 | %| — | — | %  \nInterest expense| (6,405)| (4.6)| %| (992)| (0.9)| %  \nChange in fair value of derivatives| 542 | 0.4 | %| 649 | 0.6 | %  \nOther expense| (153)| (0.1)| %| (363)| (0.3)| %  \nTotal other (expense) income, net| (5,110)| (3.7)| %| 445 | 0.4 | %  \nNet loss| $| (10,414)| (7.6)| %| $| (17,823)| (15.4)| %  \n  \nRevenues\n\nRevenues for nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $21,843 or 18.8% to $137,933 as compared to $116,090 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in unit volume of 9.4%, product mix of 6.0% and a 3.4% increase in prices.\n\nGross Profit\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $14,554 or 16% to 104,402 as compared to $89,848 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 75.7% and 77.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. \n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nTotal costs and expenses increased by $1,590 or 1% to $109,706 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $108,116 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in total costs and expenses was primarily the result of increased compensation costs of $5,118, professional services of $1,892 and bad debt expense of $915, partially offset by the reduction in royalty fees of $2,632, research projects of $2,079, marketing programs of $982 and other operating expense totaling $645.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $966 or 2% to $58,437 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $57,471 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to compensation costs of $4,425, professional services of $272, and occupancy costs of $184, partially offset by the reduction in royalty fees of $2,632, marketing programs of $982, and other costs of $352.\n\n24\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $899 or 4% to $21,063 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $20,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to product development and clinical expenses as well as non-clinical expenses related to the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft. Product development expenses represented approximately 54% and 60% of total research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 46% and 40% of total research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $275 or 1% to $30,206 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $30,481 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net compensation costs of $1,935 of which $695 was stock compensation related to the departure of the former CEO, partially offset by an increase in bad debt of $915, professional service costs of $542, and other costs of $203.\n\nOther Income and Expense\n\nOther (expense), net was $5,110 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income, net of $445 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by an increase in interest expense of $5,413, a decrease in investment income of $335, and the change in fair value of derivatives of $107, partially offset by the decrease in other expense of $210 and rental income of $90. \n\nInvestment income decreased by $335 or 29% to $816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to investment income of $1,151 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to the decrease in investments.\n\nInterest expense increased by $5,413to $6,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $992 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recognized total interest expense of $6,342 and $5,442 in connection with the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, of which $0 and $5,240 of this interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. \n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe had no income tax expense or benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to the incurrence of net operating losses in each of these periods, the benefits of which have a full valuation allowance. From time to time, we receive notices of examination of prior tax filings from federal and state authorities. We do not believe that there are any additional tax expenses or benefits currently available.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nIn preparing financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. Management regularly reviews our accounting policies and financial information disclosures. A summary of significant accounting estimates that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements was provided in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the quarter covered by this report, there have been no material changes to the accounting estimates and assumptions previously disclosed.\n\nReclassification of Financial Information\n\nEffective as of the first quarter of 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. Although the prior method of accounting continues to be an accepted alternative, the new accounting policy is more widely used in the industry and provides improved comparability of the Company’s financial statements to its peers. Accordingly, the financial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect retrospective application of the new policy. Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, we ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously such costs had been allocated based on our estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to each line item. We determined that these changes would better reflect industry practice and would provide more meaningful information as well as increased transparency of our operations. See “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional discussion.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling $24,530. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of a money market mutual fund and our investments consist of U.S. \n\n25\n\nTreasuries. Our cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased by $6,494 to $24,530 from $31,024 at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of operating activities.\n\nWe had working capital of $63,219 and a current ratio of 3.7x at September 30, 2024, compared to working capital of $57,574 and a current ratio of 2.9x at December 31, 2023. The increase in our working capital at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments, as well as cash provided by sales of our products will allow us to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months from the date of the accompanying financial statements.\n\nCash Flow Information\n\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023  \nNet cash (used in) provided by:  \nOperating activities| $| (4,200)| $| (5,505)  \nInvesting activities| (9,484)| 19,530   \nFinancing activities| 1,320 | 1,536   \nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash| $| (12,364)| $| 15,561   \n  \nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4,200 and $5,505 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The unfavorable change in net cash used in operating activities of $1,305, or 24%, is due to the net unfavorable change of $9,656 in working capital accounts partially offset by the decrease in the net loss of $7,409 and noncash changes of $3,552.\n\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $9,484 as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $19,530 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a net increase of $29,014, or 149% of net cash used in investing activities. The increase of net cash used in investing activities is principally due to the decrease in the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of investments totaling $38,444, and the increase in purchases of intangible assets of $548, partially offset by the reduction in purchases of property and equipment of $9,978 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,320 and $1,536 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $216. The unfavorable change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $217 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nCredit Facilities\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $50,000 outstanding in indebtedness under a credit facility $35,000 maturing on June 30, 2027, and $15,000 maturing on June 30, 2028. Quarterly interest only and revenue participation payments are due through each of the maturity dates. Interest is calculated as 7.5% plus the greater of three-month SOFR plus 0.1% (\"Adjusted SOFR\") or 2.0% (12.92% as of September 30, 2024). Revenue participation payments are calculated as a percentage of our net revenues, up to $70,000 in any given year, adding approximately 1.5% per year of additional interest payments on the outstanding indebtedness. Upon each maturity date or upon such date earlier repayment occurs, we will repay the principal balance and provide a make-whole payment calculated to generate an internal rate of return to the lender equal to 11.5%, less the total of all quarterly interest and revenue participation payments previously paid. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees and Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.\n\n26\n\nSources of Capital\n\nOur expected future capital requirements may depend on many factors including expanding our customer base and sales force and timing and extent of spending in obtaining regulatory approval and introduction of new products. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include issuance of additional equity securities through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our shareholders. Although we have an effective shelf registration statement, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The increasing need for capital could also make it more difficult to obtain funding through either equity or debt. Should additional capital not become available to us as needed, we may be required to take certain actions, such as slowing sales and marketing expansion, delaying regulatory approvals, or reducing headcount.\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments \n\nContractual Obligations| 2024 Remaining| 2025-2026| 2027-2028| Thereafter| Total   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(in thousands)  \nCredit Facility Principal(1)| $| — | $| — | $| 50,000 | $| — | $| 50,000   \nCredit Facility Interest(1)(2)| 1,615 | 12,920 | 6,131 | — | 20,666   \nCredit Facility Revenue Participation(1)| — | 1,512 | 987| — | 2,499   \nCredit Facility Make-Whole Payment(1)| — | — | — | — | —   \nOperating and financing lease obligations(3)| 999 | 8,421 | 6,228 | 18,568 | 34,216   \nInsurance financing agreement(5)| 465 | — | — | — | 465   \nConsulting fee obligation to former executives| 152 | — | — | — | 152   \nTransition and separation obligations to former CEO(4)| 666 | 1,048 | — | — | 1,714   \nTotal | $| 3,897 | $| 23,901 | $| 63,346 | $| 18,568 | $| 109,712   \n  \n(1) See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees and Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-Q.\n\n(2) Calculated at 12.92%, the interest rate as of September 30, 2024.\n\n(3) See Note 7 - Leases in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q.\n\n(4) Includes former CEO's 2024 bonus to be paid in March of 2025, senior advisory fees through May 2025, and eighteen months of COBRA payments.

Changes in the Adjusted SOFR rate may affect our interest expense associated with the Credit Facility. Based on the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the applicable rate would result in an increase to our annual interest expense of approximately $500.\n\n27\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and Board of Directors, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). \n\n28\n\nPART II –OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nAs disclosed in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are engaged in certain legal proceedings, and the disclosure set forth in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies relating to legal proceedings is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\n\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any investment in our business involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the information we include in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including our financial statements and related notes contained therein, and the additional information in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks may result in material harm to our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In this event, the market price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial conditions and future prospects and the trading price of our common stock could be harmed as a result of any of these risks.\n\nITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNot Applicable.\n\nITEM 5 - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nDuring the Company’s quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b-51 trading arrangement.\n\n29\n\nITEM 6 - EXHIBITS\n\nExhibitNumber| Description  \n---|---  \n10.1| [Employment Agreement, dated August 9, 2024, between Axogen Corporation and Michael Dale (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 8, 2024.)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805928/000119312524197821/d831362dex101.htm)  \n10.2| [Axogen, Inc.

(including Axogen, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Axogen Corporation, Axogen\nProcessing Corporation, Axogen Germany GmbH, and Axogen Europe GmbH, the “Company,” “Axogen,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) may provide forward-looking statements, as\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, concerning possible or anticipated future results of operations or business developments. These statements are\nbased on management's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events, or results based on various assumptions and management's estimates of trends and\neconomic factors in the markets in which the Company is active, as well as its business plans. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,”\n“estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “continue,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “goals,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-\nlooking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Our ability to market Avive+, our expectation to drive continued growth within the nerve protection category following its full launch and our expectations that Avive+\nwill continue to, be regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act;\n• Our belief that the submission timeline will allow for a potential approval of the Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") for Avance Nerve Graft in September 2025;\n• Our belief that we will continue to drive growth in the nerve protection category:\n• Our optimism associated with interest in and adoption of the Resensation® neurotization techniques for autologous and implant-based breast reconstruction; and\n• Our belief that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments, as well as cash provided by sales of our products will allow us to fund our operations through at\nleast the next 12 months.\nThe forward-looking statements are and will be subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in\nsuch forward-looking statements.

Statements\n(unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business\nAxogen, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was incorporated in Minnesota. Our business is focused on the science, development and\ncommercialization of the technologies used for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. The Company's products include Avance® Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector®,\nAxoguard Nerve Protector®, Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, Axoguard Nerve Cap®, Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix™, and Axotouch® Two-Point Discriminator. The Company is\nheadquartered in Florida. The Company has processing, warehousing, and distribution facilities in Texas and Ohio.\nThe Company manages its operations as a single operating segment. Substantially all of the Company's assets are maintained in the United States. The Company derives\nsubstantially all of its revenues from sales to customers in the United States.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPlease see Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 5, 2024, for a description of all significant accounting policies.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information to conform to the presentation used in the condensed consolidated statement of operations\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company voluntarily changed its accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. Under the new accounting policy, these costs\nare included in Costs of goods sold, whereas they were previously included in Sales and marketing expenses. Including these expenses in Costs of goods sold better aligns these\ncosts with the related revenue in the gross profit calculation. Although the prior method of accounting continues to be an accepted alternative, the new accounting policy is more\nwidely used in the industry and provides improved comparability of the Company's financial statements to its peers. This change in accounting policy has been applied\nretrospectively. The consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, has been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting\npolicy. The impact of this reclassification was an increase of $1,460 and $4,204 to Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,\nand a corresponding decrease to Sales and marketing expenses in the same periods.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company also ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously such costs had been allocated based on\nthe Company’s estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to Cost of goods sold, Sales and marketing, Research and development, and General and administrative. The\nCompany determined that these changes would better reflect industry practice and would provide more meaningful information as well as increased transparency of its\noperations. To conform the 2023 presentation to the current quarter and year to date presentation, $1,035 and $3,019 was reclassified to General and administrative, of which\n$295 and $867 was previously included in Research and development, $803 and $2,209 was previously included in Sales and marketing, and $63 and $58 was previously\nincluded in Cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nThese reclassifications had no impact on net revenue, loss from operations, net loss, or loss per common share for prior periods and do not represent a restatement of the\nCompany's previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the\ninstructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X, and; therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") and should be read in\nconjunction with the audited financial statements of the\n7\nCompany for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited, and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of results for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year due primarily to the impact of the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may impact the\nCompany's markets for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Concentration\nCash and cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Certain of the\nCompany's cash and cash equivalents balances exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insured limits or are invested in money market accounts with\ninvestment banks that are not FDIC-insured. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents in what they believe to be credit-worthy financial institutions. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $18,162 of the cash and cash equivalents balance was in excess of FDIC limits.\nRestricted Cash\nAmounts included in restricted cash represent those required to be set aside to meet contractual terms of a lease agreement held by the Company .See Note 8 - Long-Term\nDebt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees, Other Credit Facilities.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the\nsame amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 18,662 $ 31,024\nRestricted cash 6,000 6,002\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 24,662 $ 37,026\nGovernment Assistance\nAs there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP for accounting for grants to for-profit business entities, the Company accounts for the grants by analogy to\nInternational Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance (\"IAS 20\"). Government assistance and grants are\nrecognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company has met the requirements of the assistance and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received.\nThe Company received government grants of $378 and $— for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $544 and $155 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nShipping and Handling\nAll shipping and handling costs, including facility and warehousing overhead, directly related to bringing the Company’s products to their final selling destination are\nincluded in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs for products shipped to\ncustomers as a fulfillment activity as the costs are incurred as part of the transfer of the goods to the customer in accordance with ASC 606. See Reclassifications above.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAll other Accounting Standards Updates (\"ASU's\") issued and not yet effective as of September 30, 2024, and through the date of this report, were assessed and determined\nto be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company’s current or future financial position or results of operations except for the following:\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update 2023-09 — Income Taxes (Topic 740) — Improvements to\nIncome Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The new guidance provides for\n8\ndisclosure on an annual basis of the following: (i) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative\nthreshold of greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate. The amendment in ASU 2023-09 is\neffective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to enhance annual income tax reporting disclosures\nbased on the new requirements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2023-07 — Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU\n2023-07\"). The new guidance requires disclosure on an annual and interim basis of the following: (i) significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (\"CODM\") and a measure of segment profit or loss; (ii) an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition; (iii) all\nannual disclosures about a reportable segment's profit and loss and assets as currently required by Topic 280; (iv) clarify if the CODM uses more than one measure of a\nsegment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources; and (v) disclose title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses the\nreported measures. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by this amendment. The amendment in ASU 2023-07 is\neffective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for the quarters in the years after December 15, 2024, early adoption is permitted. The Company\nexpects to enhance annual segment reporting disclosures based on the new requirements.\n3.

The carrying value and fair value of the Credit Facility were $47,272 and $51,274 at September 30, 2024, and $46,603 and $51,486 at December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees.\nThe debt derivative liabilities are measured using a ‘with and without’ valuation model to compare the fair value of each tranche of the Credit Facility including the\nidentified embedded derivative features and the fair value of a plain vanilla note with the same terms. The fair value of the Credit Facility including the identified embedded\nderivative features was determined\n12\nusing a probability-weighted expected return model based on four potential settlement scenarios, one of which ended December 31, 2023, for the financing agreement as\ndisclosed in the table below. The estimated settlement value of each scenario, which would include any required make-whole payment, (see Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of\nDebt Discount and Financing Fees), is then discounted to present value using a discount rate that is derived based on the initial terms of the financing agreement at issuance and\ncorroborated utilizing a synthetic credit rating analysis.\nThe significant inputs that are included in the valuation of the debt derivative liability - first tranche include:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInput\nRemaining term (years) 2.75 years 3.5 years\nMaturity date June 30, 2027 June 30, 2027\nCoupon rate 9.5% - 13.0% 9.5% - 13.2%\nRevenue participation payments Maximum each year Maximum each year\nDiscount rate 11.56% (1) 12.06% (1)\nProbability of mandatory prepayment 2024 or after 15.0 % 15.0 %\n(1) (1)\nEstimated timing of mandatory prepayment event 2024 or after March 31, 2026 March 31, 2026\n(1) (1)\nProbability of optional prepayment event 5.0 % 5.0 %\n(1) (1)\nEstimated timing of optional prepayment event December 31, 2025 December 31, 2025\n(1) (1)\nProbability of note held-to-maturity(2) 80.0% (1) 80.0% (1)\n(1) Represents a significant unobservable input.\n(2) See Maturity date in table.\nThe significant inputs that are included in the valuation of the debt derivative liability - second tranche include:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInput\nRemaining term (years) 3.75 years 4.5 years\nMaturity date June 30, 2028 June 30, 2028\nCoupon rate 9.5% - 13.0% 9.5% - 13.2%\nRevenue participation payments Maximum each year Maximum each year\nDiscount rate 14.92 %(1) 15.60 %(1)\nProbability of mandatory prepayment 2024 or after 15.0% (1) 15.0% (1)\nEstimated timing of mandatory prepayment event 2024 or after March 31, 2026(1) March 31, 2026(1)\nProbability of optional prepayment event 5.0% (1) 5.0% (1)\nEstimated timing of optional prepayment event December 31, 2025(1) December 31, 2025(1)\nProbability of held-to-maturity(2) 80.0% 80.0%\n(1) Represents a significant unobservable input.\n(2) See Maturity date in table.\n13\n7.

Interest is calculated as 7.5% plus the greater of Adjusted SOFR or 2.0% (12.9%\nat September 30, 2024), provided that the interest rate shall never be less than9 .5%. Each tranche of the Credit Facility has a term of seven years from the date of issuance (with\nthe first tranche issued on June 30, 2020, maturing on June 30, 2027, and the second tranche issued on June 30, 2021, maturing on June 30, 2028). In connection with the Credit\nFacility, the Company entered into a revenue participation agreement (the “Revenue Participation Agreement”) with the Lender, which provided that, among other things, a\nquarterly royalty payment as a percentage of the Company’s net revenues, up to $70 million in any given year, after April 1, 2021, ending on the date upon which all amounts\nowed under the Credit Facility have been paid in full. This structure results in approximately 1.5% per year of additional interest payments on the outstanding loan amount. The\nCompany recorded $0 as interest expense for this Revenue Participation Agreement for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and $756 for each of the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Company pays the quarterly debt interest on the last day of the quarter and for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and 2023, paid $1,652 and $1,642, respectively, and $4,917 and $4,776 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, to the\nLender. The Company capitalized interest of $0 and $1,043 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $0 and $5,240 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, and 2023, towards the costs to construct and retrofit the Axogen Processing Center (\"APC Facility\") in Vandalia, Ohio which was completed during\n2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the\nassets of the Company.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nThe fair values of the debt derivative liabilities were $2,445 and $2,987 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 6 - Fair Value\nMeasurement.\nUnamortized Debt Discount and Financing Fees\nThe unamortized debt discount consists of the remaining initial fair values of the embedded derivatives related to the Credit Facility.\nThe financing fees for the Credit Facility were $642 and were recorded as a contra liability to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAmortization of debt discount and deferred financing fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was $225 and $224, respectively, and for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was $669 and $666, respectively.\nOther Credit Facilities\nThe Company had restricted cash of $6,000 and $6,002 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively for an irrevocable standby letter of credi.t\n15\n9.

Net Loss Per Common Share\nThe following reflects the net loss attributable to common shareholders and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations using the two-class\nmethod:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (1,858) $ (4,089) $ (10,414) $ (17,823)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding (Basic) 43,882,110 43,022,328 43,610,481 42,821,284\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding (Diluted) 43,882,110 43,022,328 43,610,481 42,821,284\nNet loss per common share (Basic and Diluted) $ (0.04) $ (0.10) $ (0.24) $ (0.42)\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings\nper share (1)\nStock options 1,678,775 4,552,919 3,077,373 4,321,696\nRestricted stock units 319,136 1,391,717 513,975 373,794\n(1) These common equivalent shares are not included in the diluted per share calculations as they would be anti-dilutive if the Company was in a net income position.\n11. Income Taxes\nThe Company has no recorded income tax expense or income tax benefit for thet hree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 due to the generation of net\noperating losses, the benefits of which have been fully reserved.\nThe Company has not recorded current income tax expense due to the generation of net operating losses. Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet\napproach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis\nand the tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A full valuation\nallowance has been established on the deferred tax asset as it is more likely than not that a future tax benefit will not be realized. In addition, future utilization of the available\nnet operating loss carryforward may be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of changes in ownership.\nThe Company identifies and evaluates uncertain tax positions, if any, and recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions for which there is a less than more likely than not\nprobability of the position being upheld when reviewed by the relevant tax authority. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is\nestablished on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company has not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the\nCompany would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company’s remaining open tax\nyears subject to examination by federal tax authorities include the years ended December 31, 2019, through 2023, and we received a notice of examination from the federal tax\nauthorities for tax year 2021 is currently under examination. For tax years 2005 through 2018, federal taxing authorities may examine and adjust loss carryforwards in the years\nin which those loss carryforwards are ultimately utilized.\n17\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nService Agreements\nThe Company pays Community Blood Center, (d/b/a Solvita), formerly d/b/a Community Tissue Service, (\"Solvita\") a facility fee for the use of clean\nrooms/manufacturing, storage, and office space and for services in support of its tissue processing including for routine sterilization of daily supplies, providing disposable\nsupplies and microbial services, and office support. Pursuant to the Solvita Agreement, the Company recorded expenses of $233 and $600 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $706 and $1,911 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, is included in cost of goods sold. The Solvita\nAgreement was amended on June 30, 2024, extending the term through December 31, 2026. The Solvita Agreement may be terminated by either party by providing an\neighteen-month written notice. The Company is continuing its use of Solvita for Avive+.\nDistribution and Supply Agreements\nIn August 2008, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Cook Biotech Incorporated (\"Cook Biotech\") to distribute the Axoguard Nerve\nConnector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products worldwide and the parties subsequently amended the agreement on August 4, 2023. The distribution agreement expires on\nDecember 31, 2030. The Cook Biotech agreement establishes a formula for the transfer cost of the Axoguard products and requires certain minimum purchases by the\nCompany, although, through mutual agreement, the parties have not established such minimums; and, to date, have not enforced such provision. Under the Cook Biotech\nagreement, the Company provides purchase orders to Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech fulfills the purchase orders. The agreement allows for termination provisions for both\nparties. The loss of the ability to sell the Axoguard products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business until other replacement products would be available.\nIn June 2017, the Company entered into the Nerve End Cap Supply Agreement (the \"Supply Agreement\") with Cook Biotech whereby Cook Biotech is the exclusive\ncontract manufacturer of the Axoguard Nerve Cap; the parties subsequently amended the agreement on August 4, 2023. The Supply Agreement expires on December 31, 2030.\nThe Supply Agreement establishes the terms and conditions in which Cook Biotech will manufacture the product for the Company. Under the Supply Agreement the Company\nprovides purchase orders to Cook Biotech and Cook Biotech fulfills the purchase orders. The Supply Agreement allows for termination provisions for both parties. The loss of\nthe Company's ability to sell the Axoguard Nerve Cap products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business until other replacement products would become\navailable.\nIn May 2023, the Company entered into a Supply and Manufacturing Agreement (\"HA+ Supply Agreement\") with Cook Biotech whereby Cook Biotech is the exclusive\ncontract manufacturer of the Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector. The HA+ Supply Agreement expires on July 1, 2030. The HA+ Supply Agreement establishes the terms and\nconditions in which Cook Biotech will manufacture, package, label and deliver the product to the Company. Under the HA+ Supply Agreement, the Company provides purchase\norders to Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech fulfills the purchase orders. The HA+ Supply Agreement allows for termination provisions for both parties. The loss of the Company's\nability to sell the Axoguard products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business until other replacement products would become available. On January 31,\n2024, RTI Surgical, Inc. announced the acquisition of Cook Biotech. The acquisition of Cook Biotech has not had any material impact on our relationship with Cook Biotech or\nour operations.\nInsurance Finance Agreement\nWe finance certain of our commercial insurance policies (\"Insurance Financing Agreement\"). Outstanding payments owed under the Insurance Financing Agreement are\nrecorded as \"prepaid expenses and other\" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amounts owed under the Insurance Financing Agreement included in prepaid\nexpenses and other were $465 and $0 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nProcessing Facilities\nThe Company is highly dependent on the continued availability of its processing facilities at Solvita and APC in Dayton, Ohio and could be harmed if the physical\ninfrastructure of these facilities is unavailable for any prolonged period of time.\nCertain Economic Development Grants\nThe Company obtained certain economic development grants from state and local authorities totaling up to $2,685 including $1,250 of cash grants to offset costs to acquire\nand develop the APC Facility. The economic development grants are subject to certain job creation milestones through December 31, 2023, and have clawback clauses if the\nCompany does not\n18\nmeet the job creation milestones The Company requested an extension from the grant authorities to extend the job creation milestones and received approval to extend the\nevaluation date to December 31, 2024, and the expiration date to December 31, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has received $1,188 from the cash grants.\nFair Value of the Debt Derivative Liabilities\nThe fair value of the debt derivative liabilities is $2,445 as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the debt derivative liabilities is determined using a probability-\nweighted expected return model based upon four potential settlement scenarios, one of which ended December 31, 2023, with the Credit Facility. The estimated settlement\nvalue of each scenario, which includes any required make-whole payment, is discounted to present value using a discount rate that is derived based upon the initial terms of the\nCredit Facility at issuance and corroborated utilizing a synthetic rating analysis. The calculated fair values under the four scenarios are then compared to the fair value of a plain\nvanilla note, with the difference reflecting the fair value of the debt derivative liabilities. The Company estimated the make-whole payments required under each scenario\naccording to the terms of the Credit Facility to generate an internal rate of return equal to 11.5% through the scheduled maturity dates, less the total of all quarterly interest and\nroyalty payments previously paid to the Lender. The calculation utilized the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel as required by the Credit Facility. If the debt is not prepaid but\ninstead is held to its scheduled maturities, the Company’s estimate of the make-whole payment for the first tranche and second tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30,\n2027, and June 30, 2028, respectively, are approximately zero. The Company has consistently applied this approach since the inception of the debt agreement on June 30, 2020.\nThe Company is aware that the Lender may have an alternative interpretation of the calculation of the make-whole payments that the Company believes does not properly\nutilize the same methodology utilized by the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel as described in the Credit Facility. The Company estimates the top end of the range of the make-\nwhole payments if the debt is held to scheduled maturity under an alternative interpretation to be approximately $9,000 for the first tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30,\n2027, and approximately $4,000 for the second tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2028. Further, if the debt is prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity dates and\nsubject to the alternative interpretation, the make-whole payment would be larger than the amounts herein.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is and may be subject to various claims, lawsuits, and proceedings in the ordinary course of the Company's business. Such matters are subject to many\nuncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingency\ninvolving the Company, in the opinion of management, such claims are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified, or are not expected individually or in\nthe aggregate, to result in a material, adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the Company's results\nof operations, financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies.\n19\nITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts in the discussion and analysis, unless noted otherwise, are presented in thousands.\nFinancial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect the retrospective application of voluntary changes in the Company’s accounting policy for\nshipping and handling costs, as discussed under “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form\n10-Q.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “Axogen,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Axogen, Inc., and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries Axogen Corporation (“AC”), Axogen Processing Corporation, Axogen Europe GmbH and Axogen Germany GmbH.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the leading company focused specifically on the science, development, and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. We are\npassionate about providing the opportunity to restore nerve function and quality of life for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. We provide innovative, clinically proven, and\neconomically effective repair solutions for surgeons and healthcare providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body.\nEvery day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve or the\ninability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.\nProduct Portfolio\n• Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated\nwith a second surgical site.\n• Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine (pig) submucosa extracellular matrix (\"ECM\") coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves.\n• Axoguard Nerve Protector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while\npreventing soft tissue attachments.\n• Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector™, is comprised of a processed porcine submucosa ECM base layer with a hyaluronate-alginate gel coating designed to provide short-\nand long-term protection for peripheral nerve injuries. The gel layer facilitates enhanced nerve gliding to aid in minimizing soft tissue attachments, while the base layer is\nremodeled into a long-term protective tissue layer.\n• Axoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the\ndevelopment of symptomatic or painful neuroma.\n• Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix™, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used to protect and separate tissues in the surgical bed during the critical phase of tissue\nhealing.\n• Axotouch® Two-Point Discriminator, used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin.\nOur portfolio of products is currently available in the United States (\"U.S.\"), Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain and several other European, Asian and Latin\nAmerican countries.\nRevenue from the distribution of our nerve repair products, Avance® Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector®, Axoguard Nerve Protector®, Axoguard HA+ Nerve\nProtector™, Axoguard Nerve Cap® and Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix™, in the United States (\"U.S.\") is the main contributor to our total reported sales and have been the key\ncomponent of our growth to date.\nOn June 24, 2024, we announced the full launch of Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix. Avive+ is processed and distributed in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(\"FDA\") requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and U.S. State regulations as a 361 human tissue product.\nProducts regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act are a product category under close scrutiny by the FDA for\n20\ncompliance with the regulatory requirements and potentially subject to regulatory change in the future. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could expose\nus to potential compliance actions by the FDA or state regulators and could risk the commercial availability of the product.\nOur strategy remains focused on deepening our presence in high-potential accounts specifically, Level 1 trauma centers and academic-affiliated hospitals with a high\nnumber of trained micro-surgeons. We will drive growth in these accounts through targeted expansion of nerve repair indications, and driving deeper adoption of our Nerve\nRepair Algorithm across multiple surgical specialties.\nSummary of Operational and Business Highlights\n• We completed the BLA submission for Avance® Nerve Graft on September 6, 2024. On November 1, 2024 the FDA informed us that they had accepted the BLA for\nfiling and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of September 5, 2024. The FDA further indicated that it does not currently plan to hold an\nadvisory committee meeting for the application.\n• Revenues were $48,644 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $7,373 or 17.9% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n• Gross profit was $36,438 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $4,734 or 14.9% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n21\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and percentage of total revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues $ 48,644 100.0 % $ 41,271 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 12,206 25.1 9,567 23.2\nGross profit 36,438 74.9 31,704 76.8\nCosts and expenses\nSales and marketing 18,924 38.9 19,165 46.4\nResearch and development 6,996 14.4 6,694 16.2\nGeneral and administrative 10,834 22.3 9,870 23.9\nTotal costs and expenses 36,754 75.6 35,729 86.6\nLoss from operations (316) (0.6) (4,025) (9.8)\nOther income (expense):\nInvestment income 296 0.6 367 0.9\nRental income 90 0.2 — —\nInterest expense (1,893) (3.9) (827) (2.0)\nChange in fair value of derivatives 13 — 402 1.0\nOther expense (48) (0.1) (6) —\nTotal other expense net (1,542) (3.2) (64) (0.2)\nNet loss $ (1,858) (3.8)% $ (4,089) (9.9)%\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $7,373 or 17.9% to $48,644 as compared to $41,271 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in unit volume of 7.7%, product mix of 6.0% and a 4.2% increase in prices.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $4,734 or 14.9% to $36,438 as compared to $31,704 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Gross margin was 74.9% and 76.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross margin is due to the change in our\nproduct mix.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal costs and expenses increased by $1,025 or 2.9% to $36,754 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $35,729 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The net increase in total costs and expenses was primarily due to compensation costs of $3,552 partially offset by a reduction in royalty fees of $930, R&D\nprojects of $874, and marketing programs of $770.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $241 or 1.3% to $18,924 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $19,165 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to royalty fees of $930, marketing programs of $770 and travel cost of $80, partially offset by increase in\ncompensation costs of $1,495.\n22\nResearch and development expenses increased $302 or 4.5% to $6,996 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $6,694 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to product development, clinical expenses, as well as non-clinical expenses related to the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft.\nProduct development expenses represented approximately 52% and 62% of total research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 48% and 38% of total research and development expense the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $964 or 9.8% to $10,834 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $9,870 for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to compensation costs of $1,281 of which $695 was stock compensation related to the departure of the former CEO,\nbad debt expense of $350, and certain other cost of $133, partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $800.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther expense, net increased by $1,478 to $1,542 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of $64 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The net increase in other expense was due to an increase in interest expense of $1,066, and the change in the fair value of derivatives of $389.\nInterest expense increased by $1,066 to $1,893 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $827 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nincrease was due to the completion of the APC facility in 2023 resulting in no additional interest expense being capitalized for that facility during 2024. We recognized total\ninterest expense of $1,877 and $1,866 in connection with the Credit Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, of which $0 and $1,043 of\nthis interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC Facility during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had no income tax expense or benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to the incurrence of net operating losses in each of these\nperiods, the benefits of which have a full valuation allowance. From time to time, we receive notices of examination of prior tax filings from federal and state authorities. We do\nnot believe that there are currently any material outstanding tax expenses or benefits.\n23\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and percentage of total revenue:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues $ 137,933 100.0 % $ 116,090 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 33,531 24.3 % 26,242 22.6 %\nGross profit 104,402 75.7 % 89,848 77.40 %\nCosts and expenses\nSales and marketing 58,437 42.4 % 57,471 49.5 %\nResearch and development 21,063 15.3 % 20,164 17.4 %\nGeneral and administrative 30,206 21.9 % 30,481 26.3 %\nTotal costs and expenses 109,706 79.5 % 108,116 93.1 %\nLoss from operations (5,304) (3.8)% (18,268) (15.74)\nOther (expense) income:\nInvestment income 816 0.6 % 1,151 1.0 %\nRental income 90 0.1 % — — %\nInterest expense (6,405) (4.6)% (992) (0.9)%\nChange in fair value of derivatives 542 0.4 % 649 0.6 %\nOther expense (153) (0.1)% (363) (0.3)%\nTotal other (expense) income, net (5,110) (3.7)% 445 0.4 %\nNet loss $ (10,414) (7.6)% $ (17,823) (15.4)%\nRevenues\nRevenues for nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $21,843 or 18.8% to $137,933 as compared to $116,090 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase in revenue was driven by an increase in unit volume of 9.4%, product mix of 6.0% and a 3.4% increase in prices.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $14,554 or 16% to 104,402 as compared to $89,848 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. Gross margin was 75.7% and 77.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal costs and expenses increased by $1,590 or 1% to $109,706 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $108,116 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The net increase in total costs and expenses was primarily the result of increased compensation costs of $5,118, professional services of $1,892 and bad\ndebt expense of $915, partially offset by the reduction in royalty fees of $2,632, research projects of $2,079, marketing programs of $982 and other operating expense totaling\n$645.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $966 or 2% to $58,437 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $57,471 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to compensation costs of $4,425, professional services of $272, and occupancy costs of $184, partially offset by\nthe reduction in royalty fees of $2,632, marketing programs of $982, and other costs of $352.\n24\nResearch and development expenses increased by $899 or 4% to $21,063 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $20,164 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to product development and clinical expenses as well as non-clinical expenses related to the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft.\nProduct development expenses represented approximately 54% and 60% of total research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 46% and 40% of total research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and\n2023, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $275 or 1% to $30,206 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $30,481 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net compensation costs of $1,935 of which $695 was stock compensation related to the departure of\nthe former CEO, partially offset by an increase in bad debt of $915, professional service costs of $542, and other costs of $203.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther (expense), net was $5,110 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income, net of $445 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease was driven by an increase in interest expense of $5,413, a decrease in investment income of $335, and the change in fair value of derivatives of $107, partially\noffset by the decrease in other expense of $210 and rental income of $90.\nInvestment income decreased by $335 or 29% to $816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to investment income of $1,151 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to the decrease in investments.\nInterest expense increased by $5,413 to $6,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $992 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We\nrecognized total interest expense of $6,342 and $5,442 in connection with the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, of which\n$0 and $5,240 of this interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had no income tax expense or benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to the incurrence of net operating losses in each of these\nperiods, the benefits of which have a full valuation allowance. From time to time, we receive notices of examination of prior tax filings from federal and state authorities.W e do\nnot believe that there are any additional tax expenses or benefits currently available.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments\nthat affect our financial position and results of operations. Management regularly reviews our accounting policies and financial information disclosures. A summary of\nsignificant accounting estimates that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements was provided in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the quarter covered by this report, there have been no material changes to the accounting estimates and assumptions previously disclosed.\nReclassification of Financial Information\nEffective as of the first quarter of 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. Although the prior method of accounting continues\nto be an accepted alternative, the new accounting policy is more widely used in the industry and provides improved comparability of the Company’s financial statements to its\npeers. Accordingly, the financial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect retrospective application of the new policy. Effective as of the first quarter of\n2024, we ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously such costs had been allocated based on our estimate of the proportionate share of total\nexpense to each line item. We determined that these changes would better reflect industry practice and would provide more meaningful information as well as increased\ntransparency of our operations. See “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling $24,530. Our cash equivalents are comprised\nprimarily of a money market mutual fund and our investments consist of U.S.\n25\nTreasuries. Our cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased by $6,494 to $24,530 from $31,024 at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of operating activities.\nWe had working capital of $63,219 and a current ratio of 3.7x at September 30, 2024, compared to working capital of $57,574 and a current ratio of 2.9x at December 31,\n2023. The increase in our working capital at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued\nexpenses. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments, as well as cash provided by sales of our products will allow us to\nfund our operations through at least the next 12 months from the date of the accompanying financial statements.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (4,200) $ (5,505)\nInvesting activities (9,484) 19,530\nFinancing activities 1,320 1,536\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (12,364) $ 15,561\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4,200 and $5,505 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The unfavorable change in net cash\nused in operating activities of $1,305, or 24%, is due to the net unfavorable change of $9,656 in working capital accounts partially offset by the decrease in the net loss of $7,409\nand noncash changes of $3,552.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $9,484 as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $19,530 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, a net increase of $29,014, or 149% of net cash used in investing activities. The increase of net cash used in investing activities is\nprincipally due to the decrease in the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of investments totaling $38,444, and the increase in purchases of intangible assets of $548,\npartially offset by the reduction in purchases of property and equipment of $9,978 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,320 and $1,536 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $216. The\nunfavorable change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $217 during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\nCredit Facilities\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $50,000 outstanding in indebtedness under a credit facility $35,000 maturing on June 30, 2027, and $15,000 maturing on June 30, 2028.\nQuarterly interest only and revenue participation payments are due through each of the maturity dates. Interest is calculated as 7.5% plus the greater of three-month SOFR plus\n0.1% (\"Adjusted SOFR\") or 2.0% (12.92% as of September 30, 2024). Revenue participation payments are calculated as a percentage of our net revenues, up to $70,000 in any\ngiven year, adding approximately 1.5% per year of additional interest payments on the outstanding indebtedness. Upon each maturity date or upon such date earlier repayment\noccurs, we will repay the principal balance and provide a make-whole payment calculated to generate an internal rate of return to the lender equal to 11.5%, less the total of all\nquarterly interest and revenue participation payments previously paid. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees and Note 12 - Commitments\nand Contingencies.\n26\nSources of Capital\nOur expected future capital requirements may depend on many factors including expanding our customer base and sales force and timing and extent of spending in\nobtaining regulatory approval and introduction of new products. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include issuance of additional equity securities through public or\nprivate equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our shareholders. Although we have an effective shelf\nregistration statement, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The increasing need for capital could also make it more\ndifficult to obtain funding through either equity or debt. Should additional capital not become available to us as needed, we may be required to take certain actions, such as\nslowing sales and marketing expansion, delaying regulatory approvals, or reducing headcount.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual Obligations 2024 Remaining 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter Total\n(in thousands)\nCredit Facility Principal(1) $ — $ — $ 50,000 $ — $ 50,000\nCredit Facility Interest(1)(2) 1,615 12,920 6,131 — 20,666\nCredit Facility Revenue Participation(1) — 1,512 987 — 2,499\nCredit Facility Make-Whole Payment(1) — — — — —\nOperating and financing lease obligations(3) 999 8,421 6,228 18,568 34,216\nInsurance financing agreement(5) 465 — — — 465\nConsulting fee obligation to former executives 152 — — — 152\nTransition and separation obligations to former CEO(4) 666 1,048 — — 1,714\nTotal $ 3,897 $ 23,901 $ 63,346 $ 18,568 $ 109,712\n(1) See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees and Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-Q.\n(2) Calculated at 12.92%, the interest rate as of September 30, 2024.\n(3) See Note 7 - Leases in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q.\n(4) Includes former CEO's 2024 bonus to be paid in March of 2025, senior advisory fees through May 2025, and eighteen months of COBRA payments.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor a discussion of our market risks, refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe amount of interest expense on the outstanding debt is based on Adjusted SOFR. Changes in the Adjusted SOFR rate may affect our interest expense associated with the\nCredit Facility. Based on the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the applicable rate would result in an\nincrease to our annual interest expense of approximately $500.\n27\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, and Board of Directors, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and\nevaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible\ndisclosure controls and procedures.\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).\n28\nPART II –OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nAs disclosed in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nwe are engaged in certain legal proceedings, and the disclosure set forth in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies relating to legal proceedings is incorporated herein by\nreference.\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any investment in our business involves a high degree of risk.\nBefore making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the information we include in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including our financial\nstatements and related notes contained therein, and the additional information in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks may result\nin material harm to our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In this event, the market price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose part\nor all of your investment. Additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial conditions and future\nprospects and the trading price of our common stock could be harmed as a result of any of these risks.\nITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNone.\nITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot Applicable.\nITEM 5 - OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the Company’s quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b-51 trading\narrangement.\n29\nITEM 6 - EXHIBITS\nExhibit\nNumber Description\n10.1 Employment Agreement, dated August 9, 2024, between Axogen Corporation and Michael Dale (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to\nthe Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 8, 2024.)\n10.2 Axogen, Inc.

conduit repairs, over four decades.\n• There were no statistical differences between\nallograft and autograft outcomes over all gap\nlengths for both sensory and motor nerve repairs.\n• Allograft and autograft repairs delivered\nsignificantly better rates of meaningful sensory\nrecovery in short gaps as compared to conduit\nrepairs; 87.1% and 81.6% vs. 62.2%, respectively,\np<0.05.\n• The cost analysis found that allograft does not\nrepresent an increased economic burden\ncompared to autograft.\n*statistically significant difference\nrevolutionizing the science of nerve
