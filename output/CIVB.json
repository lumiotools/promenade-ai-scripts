(NASDAQ: CIVB) (\"Civista\") announced its unaudited financial results for the three- and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024. \n\n[ ![Civista Bancshares, Inc.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/241852/civista_bancshares_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/241852/civista_bancshares_logo.html)\n\nThird quarter and year-to-date 2024 highlights:\n\n  * Net income of $8.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.4 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net income of $21.8 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to $33.3 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n  * Replaced nearly $5.7 million in non-interest income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This includes reductions in overdraft fees ($1.8 million), tax refund processing revenue ($2.4 million), and the 2023 MasterCard renewal fee ($1.5 million). Despite these decreases, non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is $0.4 million higher than the same period in 2023.\n  * Cost of deposits of 218 basis points and total funding costs of 261 basis points for the quarter.\n  * Based on the September 30, 2024, market close share price of $17.82, the $0.16 third quarter dividend is equivalent to an annualized yield of 3.59% and a dividend payout ratio of 30.2%.\n\n\n\n_CEO Commentary:_\n\n\"We're pleased with our third-quarter earnings and performance. This quarter, we maintained a disciplined approach to loan and deposit pricing and effectively implemented our downward beta strategy. We also launched some of our deposit initiatives, that better aligned our lending and core funding. As a result, we increased deposits by $246 million and reduced wholesale borrowings by $213 million, contributing to an Earnings Per Share of $0.53, up from $0.45 last quarter.\", said Dennis G. Shaffer, CEO and President of Civista.\n\n\"Our credit quality remains strong, as we continue to support lending and deepen our customer relationships. We're committed to meeting the rising demand for housing and construction financing, ensuring we address the needs of our customers and communities. With a strong third quarter coupled with the inflection in our net interest margin, we're well positioned for a strong finish to 2024.\", Shaffer commented.\n\n**Results of Operations** :\n\n_For the three-month periods ended September 30 and June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023_\n\nNet interest income increased $1.5 million, or 5.3%, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n\nInterest income increased $2.1 million attributed to average interest-earning assets increasing $86 million coupled with a 6 basis point increase in asset yield.\n\nThe increase in interest income was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in interest expenses. This was due to $246 million growth in deposits ($139 million in average balances) and a $214 million reduction in FHLB borrowings ($53 million in average balances), resulting in a net increase of $86 million in average interest-bearing liabilities when comparing Q3 2024 to Q2 2024.\n\nWhen comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period of 2023. Net interest income declined $2.3 million. Interest income increased $6.1 million while interest expense increased $8.4 million.\n\nNet interest margin decreased 53 basis points to 3.16% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.69% for the same period a year ago.\n\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to a 30-basis point increase in interest-earning asset yield, which led to $2.6 million of the increase in interest income. Additionally, a $325.7 million increase in average interest-earning assets led to $4.4 million of the increase in interest income.\n\nInterest expense increased $8.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 78 basis points, while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $583.9 million. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was $320.3 million in time-deposits, $118.9 million in demand and savings, and $154.5 million in short-term borrowings to fund growth. This shift in the funding mix, as well as rising rates, is driving the increase in the funding rate. The 78-basis point increase in funding yield led to $4.5 million additional interest expense. Additionally, the $583.9 million of additional funds led to $4.7 million of additional interest expense. Interest-bearing deposit costs have increased 65.6% compared to a year ago. \n\nAverage Balance Analysis  \n---  \n(Unaudited - Dollars in thousands)  \nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nAverage | Yield/ | Average | Yield/  \n_Assets:_ | _balance_ | _Interest_ | _rate *_ | _balance_ | _Interest_ | _rate *_  \nInterest-earning assets:  \nLoans ** | $ | 3,031,884 | 46,899 | 6.15 | % | $ | 2,679,679 | $ | 40,547 | 5.88 | %  \nTaxable securities *** | 363,584 | 3,258 | 3.24 | % | 359,154 | 2,999 | 2.95 | %  \nNon-taxable securities *** | 291,254 | 2,369 | 3.83 | % | 286,048 | 2,336 | 3.77 | %  \nFederal funds sold | - | - | 0.00 | % | - | - | 0.00 | %  \nInterest-bearing deposits in other banks | _19,144_ | 215 | _4.47_ | _%_ | _55,288_ | _719_ | 5.16 | %  \nTotal interest-earning assets *** | _$_ | _3,705,866_ | _$_ | _52,741_ | _5.64_ | _%_ | _$_ | _3,380,169_ | _$_ | _46,601_ | _5.34_ | _%_  \nNoninterest-earning assets:  \nCash and due from financial institutions | 36,868 | 22,542  \nPremises and equipment, net | 51,342 | 50,999  \nAccrued interest receivable | 13,802 | 11,673  \nIntangible assets | 134,083 | 128,215  \nBank owned life insurance | 63,190 | 53,879  \nOther assets | 57,856 | 64,008  \nLess allowance for loan losses | _(40,068)_ | _(34,283)_  \nTotal Assets | _$_ | _4,022,939_ | _$_ | _3,677,202_  \n_Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity:_  \nInterest-bearing liabilities:  \nDemand and savings | $ | 1,452,850 | $ | 4,074 | 1.12 | % | $ | 1,333,903 | $ | 2,189 | 0.65 | %  \nTime | 952,369 | 12,853 | 5.37 | % | 632,111 | 7,395 | 4.64 | %  \nShort-term FHLB borrowings | 388,022 | 5,328 | 5.46 | % | 233,547 | 4,061 | 5.51 | %  \nLong-term FHLB borrowings | 1,697 | 10 | 2.34 | % | 2,644 | 15 | 2.25 | %  \nOther borrowings | - | - | 0.00 | % | 8,026 | 198 | 9.91 | %  \nSubordinated debentures | 104,040 | 1,243 | 4.75 | % | 103,894 | 1,239 | 4.73 | %  \nRepurchase agreements | _-_ | _-_ | 0.00 | % | _993_ | _-_ | 0.00 | %  \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities | _$_ | _2,898,978_ | _$_ | _23,508_ | _3.23_ | _%_ | _$_ | _2,315,118_ | _$_ | _15,097_ | _2.45_ | _%_  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits | 687,364 | 980,835  \nOther liabilities | 55,205 | 33,040  \nShareholders' equity | _381,392_ | _348,209_  \nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity | _$_ | _4,022,939_ | _$_ | _3,677,202_  \nNet interest income and interest ratespread | $ | 29,233 | 2.42 | % | $ | 31,504 | 2.89 | %  \nNet interest margin *** | 3.16 | % | 3.69 | %  \n* - Average yields are presented on a tax equivalent basis.

The increased reserve requirement is attributed to longer expected lives of certain loans due to slower expected prepayments of lower interest rate loans in this higher interest rate environment.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, noninterest income totaled $9.7 million, a decrease of $0.9 million or 8.1% from second quarter 2024 and an increase of $1.6 million, or 19.2%, compared to the prior year's third quarter. \n\n**Noninterest income**  \n---  \n(unaudited - dollars in thousands) | Three months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | $ change | % change  \nService charges | $ | 1,595 | $ | 1,853 | $ | (258) | -13.9 | %  \nNet gain/(loss) on equity securities | 223 | 69 | 154 | 223.2 | %  \nNet gain on sale of loans | 1,427 | 787 | 640 | 81.3 | %  \nATM/Interchange fees | 1,402 | 1,424 | (22) | -1.5 | %  \nWealth management fees | 1,443 | 1,197 | 246 | 20.6 | %  \nLease revenue and residual income | 2,428 | 1,913 | 515 | 26.9 | %  \nBank owned life insurance | 717 | 266 | 451 | 169.5 | %  \nSwap fees | (14) | 21 | (35) | -166.7 | %  \nOther | _465_ | _595_ | _(130)_ | -21.8 | %  \nTotal noninterest income | _$_ | _9,686_ | _$_ | _8,125_ | _$_ | _1,561_ | 19.2 | %  \n  \nService charges for the third quarter of 2024 decreased year over year as we have eliminated our representment fee as well as reduced our overdraft charges, the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in service fees in consumer and treasury management.\n\nNet gain/(loss) on equity securities change was the result of a market valuation adjustment.\n\nNet gain on sale of loans includes gain/loss on sale of mortgages, adjustments to mortgage service rights (MSR), and gain/loss on sales of loans and leases from the Civista Leasing and Finance division; which continues to provide a strong and consistent revenue source for Civista.\n\nWealth management fees increased from organic growth in the trust and investment services business.\n\nLease revenue and residual income increased as we shifted away from operating leases to more finance leases, resulting in residual and lease rental income.\n\nIncome from Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) increased due to a death benefit on an insured individual in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOther income decreased in the third quarter which includes loan fees, loan servicing fees, and leasing rental income.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $28.7 million, an increase of $391 thousand, or 1.4%, compared to the same period in the prior year.

Real Estate Construction has increased with consistent demand for more projects across the state of Ohio. \n\nResidential Real Estate has grown primarily due to more home construction loans as we meet the demand for housing and construction financing by our customers and communities.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nTotal deposits at September 30, 2024 were $3.2 billion, an increase of $238.7 million, or 8.0%, from December 31, 2023. \n\n(unaudited - dollars inthousands)  \n---  \nSeptember30, | December31,  \n2024 | 2023 | $ Change | % Change  \nNoninterest-bearing demand | $ | 686,316 | $ | 771,699 | $ | (85,383) | -11.1 | %  \nInterest-bearing demand | 420,333 | 449,449 | (29,116) | -6.5 | %  \nSavings and money market | 1,111,771 | 854,881 | 256,890 | 30.0 | %  \nTime deposits | 456,973 | 391,809 | 65,164 | 16.6 | %  \nBrokered deposits | _548,339_ | _517,190_ | _31,149_ | 6.0 | %  \nTotal Deposits | _$_ | _3,223,732_ | _$_ | _2,985,028_ | _$_ | _238,704_ | 8.0 | %  \n  \nThe $85.4 million decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was primarily due to a $48.0 million decrease in noninterest-bearing business accounts and $36.8 million noninterest-bearing accounts related to the former tax refund processing program as customers migrate deposits to interest bearing accounts. \n\nThe $29.1 million decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily due to a $14.6 million decrease in interest-bearing personal accounts, a $7.5 million decrease in Jumbo NOW accounts, and a $3.7 million decrease in interest-bearing business accounts.\n\nThe $256.9 million increase in savings and money market deposits was primarily due to a $65.9 million increase in personal money market accounts, a $148.5 million increase in business money market accounts, $115.1 million increase in public funds money markets, partially offset by a $18.4 million decrease in statement savings coupled with a $7.2 million decrease in business savings accounts. Included in the growth are the $87 million of trust cash deposits brought onto the balance sheet in the third quarter, and $110 million of deposits associated with the Ohio Home Buyers Program.\n\nThe $65.2 million increase in time deposits was primarily due to a $22.7 million increase in Jumbo time certificates, a $23.5 million increase in retail time certificates, and a $23.5 million increase in time certificates over $250 thousand. \n\nFHLB overnight advances totaled $287.0 million on September 30, 2024, down $213.5 million from $500.5 million on June 30, 2024 and down from $338.0 million on December 31, 2023. FHLB term advances totaled $1.6 million on September 30, 2024, down from $2.4 million on December 31, 2023.\n\n**Stock Repurchase Program**\n\nSo far in 2024, Civista has not repurchased any shares, leaving the entire $13.5 million of the current repurchase authorization remaining. The current repurchase plan will expire in May 2025. In January, Civista liquidated 8,262 shares held by employees, at $18.38 per share, to satisfy tax obligations stemming from vesting of restricted shares.\n\n**Shareholders' Equity**\n\nTotal shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024, totaled $394.4 million, an increase of $22.4 million from December 31, 2023. This resulted from an increase of $14.1 million in retained earnings and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $7.6 million. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nCivista recorded net losses of $1.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net losses of $0.5 million for the same period of 2023. The allowance for credit losses to loans ratio was 1.36% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.32% at June 30, 2024 and 1.30% at December 31, 2023. \n\n_Allowance for Credit Losses_  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nNine months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nBeginning of period | $ | 37,160 | $ | 28,511  \nCECL adoption adjustments | - | 5,193  \nCharge-offs | (1,580) | (855)  \nRecoveries | 500 | 320  \nProvision | _5,188_ | _2,111_  \nEnd of period | _$_ | _41,268_ | _$_ | _35,280_  \n  \n_Allowance for Unfunded Commitments_  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nNine months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nBeginning of period | $ | 3,901 | $ | -  \nCECL adoption adjustments | - | 3,386  \nCharge-offs | - | -  \nRecoveries | - | -  \nProvision | _(520)_ | _595_  \nEnd of period | _$_ | _3,381_ | _$_ | _3,981_  \n  \nNon-performing assets at September 30, 2024 were $18.2 million, an increase of $3.1 million or 20.4%, from December 31, 2023.
