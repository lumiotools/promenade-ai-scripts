(“Verde” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: VGAS) today reported results for third quarter 2024. \n\n“We remain focused on our plans to deploy our proprietary liquid fuels processing technology through the development of commercial production plants. During Q3 2024, we continued to progress the FEED for the proposed Permian Basin project with Diamondback, which could serve as a template for additional projects going forward. We also continue to evaluate other potential opportunities to deploy our technology while remaining disciplined with our resources,” said Ernest Miller, CEO of Verde. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net loss of $(2.5) million and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock of ($0.12). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net loss of $(7.9) million and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock of ($0.39). The Company’s net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to ongoing general and administrative expenses. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million and no debt. Also as of September 30, 2024, the Company had capitalized $0.7 million of FEED costs related to the proposed Permian Basin project, net of amounts reimbursable under the joint development agreement between Verde and a wholly owned subsidiary of Diamondback Energy. \n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of George Burdette as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Burdette will be responsible for all aspects of finance for the Company and brings more than 15 years of financial, commercial, corporate development, and investment management experience. \n\n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde is a clean fuels company focused on the deployment of its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels processing technology through development of commercial production plants. Verde's syngas-to-gasoline plus (STG+®) process converts syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks (including biomass or stranded or flared natural gas) into fully finished liquid fuels that require no additional refining, such as Reformulated Blend-stock for Oxygenate Blending (“RBOB”) gasoline. \n\nFor more information, please visit [www.verdecleanfuels.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdecleanfuels.com&esheet=54151972&newsitemid=20241113513494&lan=en-US&anchor=www.verdecleanfuels.com&index=2&md5=58cbe366b160c60b00326adcb9545945). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe information included herein and in any oral statements made in connection herewith include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The goal of any such potential arrangements, if finalized and entered into, would be to help manage price risk associated with these credits and the gasoline as well as to possibly support expected project finance requirements. \n\n\n\n“Kicking off work with our FEED services partner, Chemex Global, on the Cottonmouth project was an important step forward in pursuing our first commercial scale facility for producing gasoline from waste natural gas in the Permian Basin,” said Verde CEO Ernest Miller. “We continue to work with Cottonmouth on this proposed project, with the goal to help Diamondback Energy reduce flaring and overall environmental impact from its Permian operations.” \n\n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,** |  **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  $  |  2,988,774  |  $  |  2,457,882  |  $  |  5,778,150  |  $  |  6,723,522   \nContingent consideration  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  (1,299,000  |  )   \nResearch and development expenses  |  173,020  |  85,812  |  258,855  |  168,474   \n**Total operating loss** |  3,161,794  |  2,543,694  |  6,037,005  |  5,592,996   \nOther (income)  |  (316,208  |  )  |  (94,887  |  )  |  (662,336  |  )  |  (94,887  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  -  |  101,443  |  -  |  169,268   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (2,845,586  |  )  |  (2,550,250  |  )  |  (5,374,669  |  )  |  (5,667,377  |  )   \nIncome tax (benefit)  |  (13,866  |  )  |  -  |  (13,866  |  )  |  -   \n**Net loss** |  $  |  (2,831,720  |  )  |  $  |  (2,550,250  |  )  |  $  |  (5,360,803  |  )  |  $  |  (5,667,377  |  )   \n**Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest** |  $  |  (1,928,013  |  )  |  $  |  (1,801,103  |  )  |  $  |  (3,684,725  |  )  |  $  |  (4,343,770  |  )   \n**Net loss attributable to Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.** |  $  |  (903,707  |  )  |  $  |  (749,147  |  )  |  $  |  (1,676,078  |  )  |  $  |  (1,323,607  |  )   \n**Earnings per share**  \nWeighted average Class A common stock outstanding, basic and diluted  |  6,297,162  |  6,130,487  |  6,235,439  |  6,127,383   \nLoss per Share of Class A common stock  |  $  |  (0.14  |  )  |  $  |  (0.12  |  )  |  $  |  (0.27  |  )  |  $  |  (0.22  |  )   \n  \n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**As of**  \n**June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  23,209,901  |  $  |  28,779,177   \nAccounts receivable - other  |  644,194  |  -   \nRestricted cash  |  100,000  |  100,000   \nPrepaid expenses  |  1,012,989  |  373,324   \nTotal current assets  |  24,967,084  |  29,252,501   \nNon-current assets:   \nSecurity deposits  |  160,669  |  160,669   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  405,311  |  62,505   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net  |  377,362  |  524,813   \nIntellectual patented technology  |  1,925,151  |  1,925,151   \nTotal non-current assets  |  2,868,493  |  2,673,138   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  27,835,577  |  $  |  31,925,639   \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  211,986  |  $  |  184,343   \nAccrued liabilities  |  2,816,869  |  1,976,812   \nOperating lease liabilities – current portion  |  287,289  |  297,380   \nOther current liabilities  |  24,977  |  -   \nTotal current liabilities  |  3,341,121  |  2,458,535   \nNon-current liabilities:   \nPromissory note – related party  |  -  |  409,612   \nOperating lease liabilities  |  108,989  |  232,162   \nTotal non-current liabilities  |  108,989  |  641,774   \n**Total liabilities** |  3,450,110  |  3,100,309   \nCommitments and Contingencies   \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 9,549,621 and 9,387,836 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively  |  955  |  939   \nClass C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 22,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively  |  2,250  |  2,250   \nAdditional paid in capital  |  36,050,663  |  35,014,836   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (25,598,808  |  )  |  (23,922,730  |  )   \nNoncontrolling interest  |  13,930,407  |  17,730,035   \n**Total stockholders’ equity** |  24,385,467  |  28,825,330   \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  $  |  27,835,577  |  $  |  31,925,639   \n  \n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks including biomass or stranded or flared natural gas, into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

This FEED contractor selection is the first step in furtherance of the JDA, which provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and final investment decision (“FID”). \n\n> “Chemex Global is pleased to be selected as the FEED contractor on this project, and we look forward to partnering with Verde to advance a commercial-scale implementation of its proprietary STG+ technology”\n> \n> [Post this](#)\n\nThis facility, to be located in Martin County, Texas, is anticipated to be a commercial-scale version of Verde’s existing demonstration facility in Hillsborough, New Jersey. The expected result of the project is to utilize the Company’s proprietary STG+® technology to produce approximately 2,900 barrels per day of commodity-grade gasoline. With the selection of Chemex, FEED work will now commence and is expected to be completed in early 2025. Upon FEED completion and reaching FID, it is anticipated that engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) work will then commence, with the goal to complete construction in 2027. \n\n“With the potential to mitigate the flaring of up to 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, this proposed project could serve as a template for additional natural gas-to-gasoline projects throughout the Permian Basin and other pipeline-constrained basins in the U.S., as well as addressing flared or stranded natural gas opportunities internationally,” said Ernie Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Verde. “We’re excited to continue to move this potential project forward with a highly experienced partner like Chemex.” \n\n“Chemex Global is pleased to be selected as the FEED contractor on this project, and we look forward to partnering with Verde to advance a commercial-scale implementation of its proprietary STG+ technology,” said Chemex Chief Commercial Officer, Matt Rodgers. “It is exciting to work with an innovative company like Verde, and to apply our multidisciplinary modular project execution expertise to this significant opportunity.” \n\n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a development-stage, renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks including biomass or stranded or flared natural gas into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nMay 14, 2024 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n\nHOUSTON--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. (“Verde” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VGAS), a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production facilities to convert syngas derived from diverse feedstocks into gasoline, today reported first quarter 2024 GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.13). The first quarter net loss consists of ongoing general and administrative and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks. \n\nBusiness Update Highlights Through May 14, 2024\n\n  * **Verde is participating in a US Department of Energy (DOE) funded consortium that is studying the production of zero emission methanol.** A consortium, led by TDA Research, Inc. and which also includes the University of Colorado – Denver, plans to complete a conceptual design study for a system having the potential of capturing and then utilizing ambient CO2 to produce “green” methanol. TDA will design a direct air capture (DAC) process for sourcing of CO2 from the atmosphere and lead the integration of the DAC with the methanol plant. Verde plans to design and model the methanol production unit using its proprietary STG+® technology, with the goal to utilize CO2 from the DAC, and hydrogen from a carbon-free source, to potentially produce green methanol. Total funding under the award to the consortium is $400,000. An additional $100,000 is expected to come from non-DOE sources, for aggregate funding of up to $500,000 for the project. Based on the results of the study, other project phases may follow. The Company expects that methanol may play a vital role in decarbonizing the maritime and chemical industries. \n\n\n  * **Verde continues to proceed with the selection process for FEED/EPC services for the Cottonmouth Ventures Permian Basin project.** Since the execution of the Cottonmouth Ventures JDA in February 2024, Verde continues with the selection process of a front-end engineering and design (“FEED”) and engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) partner. \n\n\n  * **Verde is in preliminary discussions with various potential offtake parties of carbon credits and gasoline.** Verde is in preliminary discussions with various parties with respect to long-term offtake arrangements for the purchase of D3 RINs, LCFS Credits, and gasoline that may be produced in any future projects. Such potential arrangements, if entered into, could help manage price risk associated with these commodities and could support expected project finance requirements. \n\n\n\n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.** **CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  $  |  2,789,376  |  $  |  4,265,640   \nContingent consideration  |  -  |  (1,299,000  |  )   \nResearch and development expenses  |  85,835  |  82,662   \n**Total operating loss** |  2,875,211  |  3,049,302   \nOther (income)  |  (346,128  |  )  |  -   \nInterest expense  |  -  |  67,825   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (2,529,083  |  )  |  (3,117,127  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  -  |  -   \n**Net loss** |  $  |  (2,529,083  |  )  |  $  |  (3,117,127  |  )   \n**Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest** |  $  |  (1,756,712  |  )  |  $  |  (2,542,666  |  )   \n**Net loss attributable to Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.** |  $  |  (772,371  |  )  |  $  |  (574,461  |  )   \n**Earnings per share**  \nWeighted average Class A common stock outstanding, basic and diluted  |  6,173,716  |  6,124,245   \nNet loss per share of Class A common stock  |  $  |  (0.13  |  )  |  $  |  (0.09  |  )   \n  \n**VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.** **CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**As of**  \n**March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  25,941,604  |  $  |  28,779,177   \nRestricted cash  |  100,000  |  100,000   \nPrepaid expenses  |  1,406,010  |  373,324   \n**Total current assets** |  **27,447,614** |  **29,252,501**  \nNon-current assets:   \nSecurity deposits  |  160,669  |  160,669   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  67,791  |  62,505   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net  |  453,862  |  524,813   \nIntellectual patented technology  |  1,925,151  |  1,925,151   \n**Total non-current assets** |  **2,607,473** |  **2,673,138**  \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **30,055,087** |  **$** |  **31,925,639**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  367,036  |  $  |  184,343   \nAccrued liabilities  |  2,227,546  |  1,976,812   \nOperating lease liabilities – current portion  |  326,446  |  297,380   \nOther current liabilities  |  32,027  |  -   \n**Total current liabilities** |  **2,953,055** |  **2,458,535**  \nNon-current liabilities:   \nPromissory note – related party  |  -  |  409,612   \nOperating lease liabilities  |  147,472  |  232,162   \n**Total non-current liabilities** |  **147,472** |  **641,774**  \n**Total liabilities** |  **3,100,527** |  **3,100,309**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 9,428,797 and 9,387,836 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively  |  943  |  939   \nClass C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 22,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023  |  2,250  |  2,250   \nAdditional paid in capital  |  35,673,145  |  35,014,836   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (24,695,101  |  )  |  (23,922,730  |  )   \nNoncontrolling interest  |  15,973,323  |  17,730,035   \n**Total stockholders’ equity** |  **26,954,560** |  **28,825,330**  \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **30,055,087** |  **$** |  **31,925,639**  \n  \n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks including biomass or stranded or flared natural gas into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

(“Verde” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VGAS), a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas derived from diverse feedstocks into gasoline, today reported full year 2023 GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.45). The full year net loss consists of ongoing general and administrative and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks. \n\nBusiness Update Highlights Through March 28, 2024\n\n  * **Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures announced the execution of a Joint Development Agreement for the first deployment of Verde’s STG+ technology in the Permian Basin.** On February 13, 2024,Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), announced the execution of a joint development agreement (“JDA”) for the proposed development, construction, and operation of a facility to produce commodity-grade gasoline utilizing associated natural gas feedstock supplied from Diamondback’s operations in the Permian Basin. The expectation for the project is to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of fully-refined gasoline utilizing Verde’s patented STG+ process. By consuming natural gas in the pipeline-constrained Permian Basin as feedstock, the proposed project could demonstrate the ability to mitigate the flaring of up to 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while also producing a high-value, salable product. The JDA provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and final investment decision (“FID”).

(NASDAQ: VGAS) (“Verde” or the “Company”) and Cottonmouth Ventures LLC, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) (“Diamondback”), today announced that the parties have executed a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) for the proposed development, construction, and operation of a facility to produce commodity-grade gasoline utilizing associated natural gas feedstock supplied from Diamondback’s operations in the Permian Basin. \n\nThe JDA provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and Final Investment Decision (“FID\") for the proposed project. The JDA frames the contracts contemplated to be entered into between the parties, including an operating agreement, ground lease agreement, construction agreement, license agreement and financing agreements as well as conditions precedent to close, such as FID. \n\nThe expectation for the project is to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of fully-refined gasoline utilizing Verde’s patented STG+® process. By consuming natural gas in the pipeline-constrained Permian Basin as feedstock, the proposed project could demonstrate the ability to mitigate the flaring of up to 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while also producing a high-value, salable product. \n\n“The Verde Clean Fuels team is incredibly excited to finalize this JDA with Diamondback Energy with the goal to produce gasoline from natural gas in the Permian Basin,” said Ernie Miller, CEO of Verde. “This arrangement brings compounding economic and environmental benefits to West Texas. We believe that the ability to de-bottleneck midstream constraints along with the potential to reduce flaring of natural gas, while creating less carbon intensive gasoline, is of paramount interest to natural gas producers.” \n\n“This agreement, with the first planned project in Martin County, fits perfectly with Diamondback’s strategy to decarbonize the oil field while ensuring a return for our investors,” said Kaes Van’t Hof, President of Diamondback. “Additionally, the scalability of the project is incredibly exciting, with similar natural gas-to-gasoline facilities possible across Diamondback’s locations in West Texas. We are proud to partner with Verde to bring this technology to the market.” \n\nThe proposed facility, which is to be located in Martin County, Texas in the heart of the Permian Basin, could serve as a template for additional natural gas-to-gasoline projects throughout the Permian Basin and other pipeline-constrained basins in the U.S., as well as address flared or stranded natural gas opportunities internationally. \n\n**About Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas, derived from diverse biomass feedstocks, such as yard waste, agricultural waste, and sorted municipal solid waste, as well as stranded or flared natural gas (including renewable natural gas) into gasoline through its innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

Reports Third Quarter 2023 Earnings**\n\nNovember 13, 2023 05:07 PM Eastern Standard Time\n\nHOUSTON--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. (“Verde”) (Nasdaq: VGAS), a company focused on becoming leading supplier of gasoline and other fuels derived from renewable feedstocks or natural gas, today reported third quarter 2023 GAAP diluted loss per share of $(0.13). The loss consists of ongoing general and administrative and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks that are otherwise landfilled. \n\nBusiness Update Highlights\n\n  * **Verde has entered a Master Services Agreement with Anacapa Engineering and Design.** Verde has entered into a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Anacapa Engineering and Design to support Verde through the California permitting process and the accompanying Environmental Impact Report for our Elk Hills Project. The Elk Hills Project is located at CRC’s Net Zero Industrial Park in Kern County, California where Verde proposes to produce over 7 million gallons of renewable gasoline from agricultural waste while sequestering over 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The resulting fuel is expected to have a negative carbon intensity as a result of the carbon capture and sequestration. Gasoline produced at the Elk Hills facility is expected to qualify for the federal D3 RIN, California’s LCFS credit, and the EPA’s 45-Q carbon sequestration credit. \n\n\n  * **Verde is in discussions with various potential offtakers of carbon credits and gasoline.** Verde is discussing long-term offtake arrangements with various entities, including super-majors, for the purchase of D3 RINs, LCFS Credits, and gasoline produced by our facilities. Such an arrangement would help manage price risk associated with these commodities and would support our project finance requirements. \n\n\n  * **Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures are negotiating a Joint Development Agreement for the first proposed location in the Permian Basin.** Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures have completed a preliminary evaluation of several possible Permian Basin locations, including a review of natural gas supply and available utilities, and the parties have selected the first development location for a potential joint project. Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures expect to enter into a Joint Development Agreement to proceed with Front End Engineering and Design (FEED), permitting, and other development activities required for Final Investment Decision (FID). \n\n\n  * **Verde has commenced the selection process for FEED/EPC services for the Verde – Cottonmouth Ventures plant in the Permian Basin.** Verde has conducted an evaluation of FEED (Front End Engineering and Design) and EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) providers and is evaluating information and proposals from a select group of firms. Verde expects to enter into a FEED contract upon the completion of its Joint Development Agreement with Cottonmouth Ventures. \n\n\n\n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30,** |  **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2022**  \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  $  |  2,511,176  |  $  |  867,704  |  $  |  9,234,697  |  $  |  3,338,467   \nContingent Consideration  |  -  |  (5,288,000  |  )  |  (1,299,000  |  )  |  (7,181,000  |  )   \nResearch and development expenses  |  78,314  |  72,548  |  246,788  |  242,353   \n**Total Operating (income) loss** |  2,589,490  |  (4,347,748  |  )  |  8,182,485  |  (3,600,180  |  )   \nOther (income)  |  (144,004  |  )  |  -  |  (238,891  |  )  |  -   \nInterest Expense  |  67,430  |  -  |  236,699  |  -   \nLoss (income) before income taxes  |  2,512,916  |  (4,347,748  |  )  |  8,180,293  |  (3,600,180  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  119,186  |  -  |  119,186  |  -   \n**Net income (net loss)** |  $  |  (2,632,102  |  )  |  $  |  4,347,748  |  $  |  (8,299,479  |  )  |  $  |  3,600,180   \n**Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest** |  $  |  (1,858,910  |  )  |  -  |  $  |  (6,202,678  |  )  |  -   \n**Net income (loss) attributable to Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.** |  $  |  (773,192  |  )  |  $  |  4,347,748  |  $  |  (2,096,801  |  )  |  $  |  3,600,180   \n**Earnings per share**  \nWeighted average Class A common stock outstanding, basic and diluted  |  6,153,461  |  N/A  |  6,136,171  |  N/A   \nLoss per Share of Class A common stock  |  $  |  (0.13  |  )  |  N/A  |  $  |  (0.34  |  )  |  N/A   \n  \n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2023** |  **December 31, 2022**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  31,153,940  |  $  |  463,475   \nRestricted cash  |  100,000  |  -   \nPrepaid expenses  |  812,929  |  113,676   \nDeferred transaction costs  |  -  |  3,258,880   \nDeferred financing costs  |  28,847  |  6,277   \n**Total current assets** |  **32,095,716** |  **3,842,308**  \nNon-current assets:   \nSecurity deposits  |  268,669  |  258,000   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  8,374  |  7,414   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net  |  273,712  |  323,170   \nIntellectual patented technology  |  1,925,151  |  1,925,151   \n**Total non-current assets** |  **2,475,906** |  **2,513,735**  \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **34,571,622** |  **$** |  **6,356,043**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  475,119  |  $  |  2,857,223   \nAccrued liabilities  |  2,250,687  |  762,119   \nOperating lease liabilities – current portion  |  255,078  |  237,970   \nNotes payable – insurance premium financing  |  -  |  11,166   \nPromissory note – related party  |  409,612  |  -   \nIncome taxes payable  |  431,632  |  -   \n**Total current liabilities** |  **3,822,128** |  **3,868,478**  \nNon-current liabilities:   \nContingent consideration  |  -  |  1,299,000   \nOperating lease liabilities  |  -  |  85,200   \n**Total non-current liabilities** |  **-** |  **1,384,200**  \n**Total liabilities** |  **3,822,128** |  **5,252,678**  \nCommitments and Contingencies (see Note 5)   \nStockholders’ equity   \nIntermediate Member’s Equity  |  $  |  -  |  $  |  12,775,902   \nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 9,387,836 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2023  |  939  |  -   \nClass C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 22,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2023  |  2,250  |  -   \nAdditional paid in capital  |  34,737,203  |  -   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (23,275,942  |  )  |  (11,672,537  |  )   \nNoncontrolling interest  |  19,285,044  |  -   \n**Total stockholders’ equity** |  **30,749,494** |  **1,103,365**  \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **34,571,622** |  **$** |  **6,356,043**  \n  \n**About Verde Clean Fuels**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc. is a renewable energy company specializing in the conversion of synthesis gas, or syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks, such as biomass, municipal solid waste and mixed plastics, as well as natural gas (including synthetic natural gas) and other feedstocks, into gasoline through an innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process.

Reports Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results and Announces Filing of Form 10-Q**\n\nAugust 14, 2023 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n\nHOUSTON--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. (“Verde” or the “Company\"), an emerging leader in the production of renewable gasoline derived from renewable and natural gas feedstocks, today reported second quarter 2023 GAAP diluted loss per share of $(0.12). The loss consists of ongoing general and administrative, and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks that are otherwise landfilled. \n\n> “During the second quarter, Verde’s business continued to progress meaningfully toward the first commercial deployment of our proprietary syngas-to-gasoline, or STG+, process”\n> \n> [Post this](#)\n\nBusiness Update Highlights\n\n  * **Signing of a Carbon Capture Agreement with Carbon TerraVault.** Verde has entered into a non-binding agreement with Carbon TerraVault JV HoldCo, LLC, a carbon management partnership focused on carbon capture and sequestration, formed between Carbon TerraVault, a subsidiary of California Resources Corporation (“CRC”) (NYSE: CRC), and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP). The agreement provides for a plant location at CRC’s Net Zero Industrial Park in Kern County, California where Verde proposes to produce over 7 million gallons of renewable gasoline from agricultural waste while sequestering over 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The resulting fuel is expected to have a negative carbon intensity as a result of the carbon capture and sequestration. Gasoline produced at the Elk Hills facility is expected to qualify for the federal D3 RIN, California’s LCFS credit, and the EPA’s 45-Q carbon sequestration credit. \n\n\n  * **Selection of the site for Verde’s proposed natural gas-to-gasoline facility in West Texas.** Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures have completed a preliminary evaluation of several possible Permian Basin locations, including a review of natural gas supply and available utilities, and the parties have selected the first development location for a potential joint project. The proposed facility would utilize undervalued Permian Basin gas and mitigate flaring and pipeline congestion in the region. Verde expects to enter into a Joint Development Agreement with Cottonmouth Ventures to proceed with Front End Engineering and Design (FEED), permitting, and other development activities required for Final Investment Decision (FID). \n\n\n  * **Holding of additional potential customer discussions for the Company’s renewable gasoline products.** Verde is discussing long-term offtake arrangements with various entities for the purchase of D3 RINs, LCFS Credits, and gasoline produced by our facilities. Such an arrangement would help manage price risk associated with these commodities and would support our project finance requirements. \n\n\n\n“During the second quarter, Verde’s business continued to progress meaningfully toward the first commercial deployment of our proprietary syngas-to-gasoline, or STG+, process,” said Ernie Miller, CEO of Verde. “The agreement we signed with Carbon TerraVault for carbon capture at the proposed Kern County facility site further evidences our commitment to reducing full cycle emissions from gasoline production. At the same time, site selection for our proposed West Texas facility in partnership with Cottonmouth Ventures moves us closer to helping to eliminate flaring of stranded natural gas in the region, and using otherwise wasted resources to drive the transition to clean fuels. I am incredibly proud of our teams for being leaders in the transition to clean transportation for all.” \n\n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three-month ended** |  **Three-month ended** |  **Six-month ended** |  **Six-month ended**  \n**June 30, 2023** |  **June 30, 2022** |  **June 30, 2023** |  **June 30, 2022**  \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  2,457,882  |  1,142,730  |  6,723,522  |  2,470,764   \nContingent Consideration  |  -  |  (1,893,000  |  )  |  (1,299,000  |  )  |  (1,893,000  |  )   \nResearch and development expenses  |  85,812  |  72,562  |  168,474  |  169,804   \n**Total Operating (income) expenses** |  2,543,694  |  (677,708  |  )  |  5,592,996  |  747,568   \nOther (income)  |  (94,887  |  )  |  -  |  (94,887  |  )  |  -   \nInterest Expense  |  101,443  |  -  |  169,269  |  -   \nProvision for income taxes  |  -  |  -   \n**Net income (net loss)** |  (2,550,250  |  )  |  677,708  |  (5,667,377  |  )  |  (747,568  |  )   \n**Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest** |  (1,801,103  |  )  |  -  |  (4,343,770  |  )   \n**Net income (loss) attributable to Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.** |  (749,147  |  )  |  677,708  |  (1,323,607  |  )  |  (747,568  |  )   \n**Earnings per share**  \nWeighted average Class A Common Stock outstanding, basic and diluted  |  6,130,487  |  N/A  |  6,127,383  |  N/A   \nLoss per Share of Class A Common Stock  |  (0.12  |  )  |  N/A  |  (0.22  |  )  |  N/A   \n  \n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2023** |  **December 31, 2022**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  33,165,369  |  $  |  463,475   \nRestricted cash  |  100,000  |  -   \nPrepaid expenses  |  1,114,915  |  113,676   \nDeferred transaction costs  |  -  |  3,258,880   \nDeferred financing costs  |  28,847  |  6,277   \n**Total current assets** |  **34,409,131** |  **3,842,308**  \nNon-current assets:   \nSecurity deposits  |  258,000  |  258,000   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  6,254  |  7,414   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net  |  209,164  |  323,170   \nFinance lease right-of-use assets, net  |  5,378,154  |  -   \nIntellectual patented technology  |  1,925,151  |  1,925,151   \n**Total non-current assets** |  **7,776,723** |  **2,513,735**  \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **42,185,854** |  **$** |  **6,356,043**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  765,443  |  $  |  2,857,223   \nAccrued liabilities  |  1,963,109  |  762,119   \nOperating lease liabilities – current portion  |  209,164  |  237,970   \nFinance lease liabilities – current portion  |  462,977  |  -   \nNotes payable – insurance premium financing  |  3,722  |  11,166   \nPromissory note – related party  |  409,279  |  -   \nIncome taxes payable  |  292,673  |  -   \n**Total current liabilities** |  **4,106,367** |  **3,868,478**  \nNon-current liabilities:   \nContingent consideration  |  -  |  1,299,000   \nOther accrued expenses – long term  |  -  |  -   \nOperating lease liabilities  |  -  |  85,200   \nFinance lease liabilities – long term  |  4,974,771  |  -   \n**Total non-current liabilities** |  **4,974,771** |  **1,384,200**  \n**Total liabilities** |  **$** |  **9,081,138** |  **$** |  **5,252,678**  \nStockholders’ equity   \nIntermediate Member’s Equity  |  $  |  -  |  $  |  12,775,902   \nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 9,387,836 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023  |  939  |  -   \nClass C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 22,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023  |  2,250  |  -   \nAdditional paid in capital  |  34,460,323  |  -   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (22,502,750  |  )  |  (11,672,537  |  )   \nNoncontrolling interest  |  21,143,954  |  -   \n**Total stockholders’ equity** |  **33,104,716** |  **1,103,365**  \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **42,185,854** |  **$** |  **6,356,043**  \n  \n**About Verde Clean Fuels**\n\nVerde Clean Fuels, Inc.

CTV JV initially plans to sequester a minimum of 100,000 metric tons (MT) per year of carbon dioxide (CO2) from Verde’s facility at the CTV I carbon storage vault. This emissions avoidance is the equivalent of taking nearly 22,000 passenger vehicles off the road. This new facility is expected to produce approximately 21,000 gallons per day of renewable gasoline (fully refined, finished fuel) from biomass and other agricultural waste feedstock to help support the further decarbonization of California’s economy and its transportation sector. \n\n“Traditional gasoline used today is refined from crude oil and makes up over half of greenhouse gas emissions generated by the U.S. transportation sector, the largest contributor to GHG emissions. We believe our proprietary technology and scientific approach will further enable California’s consumers of gasoline to seamlessly and materially participate in the critical decarbonization of our atmosphere and help achieve California’s climate goals,” said Ernest Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Verde. “Our partnership with CTV marks a significant step towards fulfilling our domestic growth ambitions and represents a concrete pathway to decarbonizing the transportation sector. By teaming up with the leading carbon management business in the U.S., we are poised to make a substantial impact.” \n\n“Doubling the CO2 storage opportunities under CDMAs at our Net Zero Industrial Park at Elk Hills in a matter of eight months further underscores CRC’s carbon management strategy and dedication to energy transition in California,” said Francisco Leon, CRC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This new agreement between CTV JV and Verde Clean Fuels provides an innovative approach to renewable fuels at the heart of energy development in the state, and further validates CRC’s decarbonization efforts by a publicly traded company looking to expand in California.” \n\n**Project & Agreement Highlights:**\n\n  * The renewable gasoline facility will employ Verde proprietary and innovative liquid fuels technology to convert synthetic gas (syngas) into renewable gasoline. The gasification system is expected to be supplied by InEnTec LLC.

Words such as \"expect,\" “could,” “may,” \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" “ability,” \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" “estimate,” “forecast,” \"target,\" “guidance,” “outlook,” “opportunity” or “strategy” or similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. \n\nAlthough Verde believes the expectations and forecasts reflected in Verde's forward-looking statements are reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Verde's control. No assurance can be given that such forward-looking statements will be correct or achieved or that the assumptions are accurate or will not change over time. Particular uncertainties that could cause Verde's actual results to be materially different than those expressed in Verde's forward-looking statements include: \n\n  * Verde’s ability to finalize definitive documents and reach a final investment decision with respect to the Verde project contemplated by the CDMA (the “CDMA projected facility”); \n  * Verde’s ability to obtain financing for the facility; \n  * Verde’s ability to achieve expected production volumes and associated CO2 generation and the ability of the CTV JV to sequester such CO2 volumes at the facility; \n  * Verde's ability to successfully execute on the construction of the facility and other aspects of infrastructure projects and enter into third party contracts on contemplated terms; \n  * fluctuations in commodity prices and the potential for sustained low commodity prices; \n  * equipment, service or labor price inflation or unavailability; \n  * legislative or regulatory changes, including those related to (i) the management of energy, water, land, greenhouse gases (GHGs) or other emissions, (ii) the protection of health, safety and the environment, (iii) Verde's ability to claim and utilize tax credits or other incentives, or (iv) the transportation, marketing and sale of Verde's products and CO2; \n  * the reduction or elimination of government economic incentives to the renewable energy market; \n  * existing laws and regulations and changes to laws, regulations and policies that affect Verde’s operations; \n  * demand for renewable energy not being sustained; \n  * the ability to qualify for federal and state level low-carbon fuel credits; \n  * any decline in the value of carbon credits and the development of the carbon credit markets; \n  * availability or timing of, or conditions imposed on, permits and approvals necessary for drilling or development activities and carbon management projects; \n  * Verde’s ability to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain key employees; \n  * Verde’s ability to develop and operate new projects and obtain financing for new projects; \n  * Verde’s dependence on suppliers; \n  * changes in business strategy and Verde's capital plan; \n  * Verde's ability to realize the benefits contemplated by the business strategies and initiatives related to energy transition, including carbon capture and storage projects and other renewable energy efforts; \n  * global geopolitical, socio-demographic and economic trends and technological innovations; \n  * limitations on Verde's financial flexibility; \n  * insufficient cash to fund Verde's capital plan; \n  * insufficient capital or lack of liquidity in the capital markets or inability to attract potential investors; \n  * limitations on transportation or storage capacity; \n  * Verde's ability to successfully gather and verify data regarding emissions, its environmental impacts and other initiatives; \n  * climate-related conditions and weather events; \n  * risks relating to Verde’s status as a development stage company with a history of net losses; \n  * risks relating to the uncertainty of success or delays of Verde’s research and development efforts; \n  * the ability of Verde to execute its business model, including market acceptance of gasoline derived from renewable feedstocks; \n  * litigation and the ability to adequately protect intellectual property rights; \n  * competition from companies with greater resources and financial strength in the industries in which Verde operates; \n  * disruptions due to accidents, mechanical failures, power outages, transportation or storage constraints, natural disasters, labor difficulties, cyber-attacks or other catastrophic events; \n  * pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks, or other public health events, such as the COVID-19; and \n  * other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors in Verde's periodic filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on From 10-K, and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Verde’s SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC’s website at [http://www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=53495288&newsitemid=20230801848429&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&index=4&md5=c5ff09a57ce63827ee60314bfb1a9542). \n\n\n\nVerde cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this document, which speak only as of the filing date, and Verde undertakes no obligation to update this information.
