(NASDAQ: VERI), a leader in building enterprise AI solutions, today announced the launch of Veritone Data Refinery (VDR) a groundbreaking offering designed to help enterprises transform vast amounts of unstructured data into high-quality, AI-ready assets. Leveraging Veritone’s proprietary aiWARE™ platform, this new solution empowers organizations to transform and manage their video, audio and text data for training sophisticated AI models, and even optimize revenue opportunities through data monetization. \n\nAccording to [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/synthetic-data-funding-big-tech-trends/), the availability of high-quality text data is expected to dwindle by 2026, posing significant challenges for advancing AI technology. VDR enables organizations to address this challenge head-on by converting unstructured data into structured datasets ready for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which require diverse data inputs such as images, text, and audio. Organizations can centralize and normalize their data from images, text, and videos, allowing them to maximize their AI capabilities from chatbots to fine-tuned models and unlock future opportunities to leverage analytics and products. \n\n“With Veritone Data Refinery, we’re bridging a critical emerging gap in the AI ecosystem by turning raw data into high-value assets that can power next-generation AI,” said Ryan Steelberg, president and chief executive officer, Veritone. “Veritone’s decade-long commitment to advancing AI technology has uniquely positioned us to deliver an end-to-end solution that not only transforms data but does so securely, ethically and at scale. This commitment ensures that our clients can innovate responsibly while maximizing the potential of their proprietary data.” \n\nThrough aiWARE’s advanced capabilities, VDR transforms disparate data silos into a centralized and secure repository. From this repository, enterprises can manage, secure and optimize their intellectual property empowering them to confidently: \n\n  * Extract immediate value and ROI out of Veritone’s 20+ award-winning applications, serving both Public and Commercial sectors; \n  * Identify custom AI solution and development needs, including training and fine-tuning AI cognitive and large language models; or \n  * Explore monetization opportunities through third-party data licensing. \n\n\n\nIn a rapidly evolving AI landscape, VDR helps meet the growing demand for high-quality datasets essential for AI advancement with deep and diverse data covering content from education, foreign language, sports, TV, film, podcasts, audio descriptions and more. VDR’s accessibility of assets allows developers, engineers and data scientists the scale to solve their data needs. \n\nAs data rights holders become increasingly protective of their assets, Veritone’s solution ensures that enterprises maintain full control over the privacy and security of their data. With enterprise-grade encryption, GDPR compliance and SOC2 certification, VDR provides peace of mind while unlocking new avenues for AI innovation and revenue generation. \n\nTo learn more about Veritone Data Refinery, please visit <https://www.veritone.com/industries/data-asset-management/>. \n\n**About Veritone**\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) builds human-centered enterprise AI solutions.

(NASDAQ:VERI)** , a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“The divestiture of Veritone One marks a defining moment in our company's evolution, positioning us as a pure-play enterprise AI company at a pivotal time in the technology landscape,\" said Ryan Steelberg, Chief Executive Officer of Veritone. “With over 3,000 existing customers across Commercial and Public Sectors, we're now poised to capitalize on the unprecedented growth in the AI solutions market. As we look toward 2025, we're energized by our streamlined operational focus and enhanced ability to invest in innovation that will truly differentiate Veritone in the enterprise AI marketplace.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $22.0 million, a decrease of 21% compared to Q3 2023.\n  * Software Products and Services revenues of $14.7 million, a decrease of 28% compared to $20.4 million in Q3 2023 driven by expected declines in consumption- based revenue customers, including Amazon and declines in one-time non-recurring software revenue.\n  * Managed Services revenue of $7.3 million as compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Total Software Products & Services Customers of 3,291, down 7% year over year, as compared to September 30, 2023, largely driven by Commercial Enterprise, which began sunsetting legacy Career Builder customers following the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, offset by an increase across Public Sector from growth in public safety customers.\n  * Total New Bookings of $16.5 million, up 17% sequentially from Q2 2024 and 6% year over year, as compared to Q3 2023.\n  * Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) (as defined below)of $63.3 million, down from $89.3 million in Q3 2023 driven by declines in consumption-based revenue, including Amazon, offset by a slight increase from recurring subscription-based SaaS revenue customers.\n  * Net loss from Continuing Operations of $22.5 million, as compared to a loss of $26.7 million in Q3 2023 driven by lower overall operating expenses resulting from our past cost reduction plans and offset by decline in revenue.\n  * Non-GAAP gross profit of $15.7 million, a decrease of 25% or $5.3 million as compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to the decline in revenue.\n  * Non-GAAP gross margins of 71.2% as compared to 74.9% in Q3 2023.\n  * Net Loss of $21.7 million, as compared to $24.5 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP Net Loss of $7.1 million, which was relatively flat as compared to Q3 2023.\n\n\n\n**Divestiture of Veritone One, LLC**\n\nThrough October 17, 2024 (the “Divestiture Closing Date”), we operated Veritone One, LLC (“Veritone One”), a full-service advertising agency, to provide differentiated Managed Services to our customers. On October 17, 2024, we sold all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P. (such transaction, the “Divestiture”). Veritone One’s services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics, specializing in host-endorsed and influencer advertising across primarily radio, podcasting, streaming audio, social media and other digital media channels. We determined that the Divestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a material effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in this earnings release as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\n**About Our Sales Pipeline**\n\nOur sales pipeline represents revenue we expect to receive based on the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts outstanding at the end of the quarter and contracts that we believe have a high probability of closing in the next three to twelve months. We include in our sales pipeline fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term and we do not include any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services) and any fees payable after contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of our customer. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year and may include professional fees required to enable our technology in certain environments we do not host or have direct control over. In some cases, our customers may have the ability to terminate our agreements on short notice and our pipeline does not consider the potential impact of any early termination. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full sales pipeline.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n_Unaudited_ |  **Percent** |  **Percent**  \n_(in $000s)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nRevenue |  $ |  21,993 |  $ |  27,968 |  (21 |  )% |  $ |  70,204 |  $ |  72,883 |  (4 |  )%  \nLoss from operations |  $ |  (22,492 |  ) |  $ |  (25,183 |  ) |  11 |  % |  $ |  (67,167 |  ) |  $ |  (79,773 |  ) |  16 |  %  \nNet loss from continuing operations |  $ |  (22,511 |  ) |  $ |  (26,732 |  ) |  16 |  % |  $ |  (72,072 |  ) |  $ |  (76,012 |  ) |  5 |  %  \nNet loss |  $ |  (21,746 |  ) |  $ |  (24,541 |  ) |  11 |  % |  $ |  (69,175 |  ) |  $ |  (70,800 |  ) |  2 |  %  \nNon-GAAP gross profit* |  $ |  15,668 |  $ |  20,942 |  (25 |  )% |  $ |  50,590 |  $ |  51,502 |  (2 |  )%  \nNon-GAAP net loss from continuing operations* |  $ |  (11,097 |  ) |  $ |  (10,411 |  ) |  (7 |  )% |  $ |  (31,139 |  ) |  $ |  (36,833 |  ) |  15 |  %  \nNon-GAAP net loss* |  $ |  (7,113 |  ) |  $ |  (7,943 |  ) |  10 |  % |  $ |  (21,579 |  ) |  $ |  (30,523 |  ) |  29 |  %  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n_Unaudited_ |  **Percent** |  **Percent**  \n_(in $000s, except customers)_ |  **2024** |  **2023(1)** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023(1)** |  **Change**  \n_Software Products & Services_  \nSoftware Revenue* |  $ |  14,694 |  $ |  20,361 |  (28 |  )% |  $ |  45,549 |  $ |  63,643 |  (28 |  )%  \nTotal Software Products & Services Customers(2) |  3,291 |  3,536 |  (7 |  )% |  3,291 |  3,536 |  (7 |  )%  \nAnnual Recurring Revenue(3)* |  $ |  63,280 |  $ |  89,299 |  (29 |  )% |  $ |  63,280 |  $ |  89,299 |  (29 |  )%  \nTotal New Bookings(4) |  $ |  16,471 |  $ |  15,501 |  6 |  % |  $ |  16,471 |  $ |  15,501 |  6 |  %  \nGross Revenue Retention(5) |  >90% |  >90% |  >90% |  >90%  \n  \n_(1) All of the supplemental financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean (as defined below) as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023. __(2) “Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean. __(3) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022 where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues. __(4) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services). __(5) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated reflecting the acquisition of Broadbean as if the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2022._\n\n_* See tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to directly comparable GAAP measures and for the definitions used for Software Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information._\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**Public Sector**\n\n  * Closed 13 new public safety and government customers, including the Department of Justice - Office of Public Affairs.\n  * Signed agreements with two of the largest counties in Southern California and a state-wide law enforcement agency.\n  * Expanded market reach with new strategic partnerships, including Nuix and international conglomerate, Getac.\n\n\n\n**Commercial Enterprise**\n\n  * Signed multi-year agreement with iHeartMedia, for expansion across their 850+ stations, enabling seamless and analytical process and review of unstructured audio data in near-real time.\n  * Secured AWS Media and Entertainment Services Competency in Media Supply Chain and Data Science & Analytics, recognizing our specialized expertise, technical proficiency and proven success in helping customers transform their media and entertainment operations with innovative cloud-based AI solutions.\n  * Signed agreement with E.W.

Software Products & Services revenue of $14.7 million decreased by $5.7 million or 28% year over year driven by expected declines in Commercial Enterprise principally from consumption based customers, including Amazon and one-time software revenue in Q3 2023 that did not recur in Q3 2024. Managed Services revenue of $7.3 million was relatively flat when compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $22.5 million improving $4.42 million as compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the year over year improvement in loss from operations, coupled with a $1.6 million higher tax benefit from income in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.1 million decreased by 10% when compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by the decline in Non-GAAP gross profit, which was partially offset by cost reductions enacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,291 was down 7% year over year relative to Total Software Product & Services Customers as of September 30, 2023, principally due to declines in Commercial Enterprise from planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform, offset by increases in Public Sector. Total New Bookings increased by 6% to $16.5 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings, offset by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue of $63.3 million decreased 29% year over year driven in large part by the declines in Commercial Enterprise consumption spending from customers, offset by a slight increase year over year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue from subscription-based SaaS customers.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\n**Full Year 2024**\n\n  * Revenue is expected to be in the range of $92.5 million to $93.5 million, as compared to $100.0 million for the full year of 2023\n  * Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(37.5) million to $(36.5) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $(45.5) million for the full year of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2025**\n\n  * Revenue is expected to be in the range of $107.0 million to $122.0 million, as compared to the midpoint of $93.0 million for fiscal 2024.\n  * Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(25.0) million to $(15.0) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss midpoint of $(37.0) million for fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\n_These updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance._\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (5:30 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its third quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and representation services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing and representation services and supporting operations.\n\n**_About Veritone_**\n\n_Veritone (NASDAQ: VERI) builds human-centered enterprise AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate,” “confident” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our operations and financial results after the sale of Veritone One; our ability to continue as a going concern; our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our operations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or ongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues. (5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues. (6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023. (7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of revenue to pro forma revenue and the calculation of pro forma annual recurring revenue.\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**Mar 31,** |  **Jun 30,** |  **Sept 30,** |  **Dec 31,** |  **Mar 31,** |  **Jun 30,** |  **Sept 30,** |  **Dec 31,** |  **Mar 31,** |  **Jun 30,** |  **Sep 30,**  \n**2022** |  **2022** |  **2022** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2023** |  **2023** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2024**  \nSoftware Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s) |  $ |  18,167 |  $ |  18,379 |  $ |  20,812 |  $ |  27,220 |  $ |  14,127 |  $ |  14,093 |  $ |  20,361 |  $ |  19,820 |  $ |  15,220 |  $ |  15,632 |  $ |  14,694  \nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1) |  6,204 |  6,974 |  7,639 |  8,230 |  8,156 |  8,374 |  8,739 |  8,662 |  8,517 |  8,690 |  8,169  \nBroadbean Revenue included in Software Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s) |  — |  — |  — |  — |  — |  (1,716 |  ) |  (8,739 |  ) |  (8,662 |  ) |  (8,517 |  ) |  (8,690 |  ) |  (8,169 |  )  \nPro Forma Software Revenue (in 000’s) |  $ |  24,371 |  $ |  25,353 |  $ |  28,451 |  $ |  35,450 |  $ |  22,283 |  $ |  20,751 |  $ |  20,361 |  $ |  19,820 |  $ |  15,220 |  $ |  15,632 |  $ |  14,694  \nManaged Services Revenue (in 000’s) |  16,240 |  15,856 |  16,384 |  16,670 |  16,136 |  13,874 |  14,772 |  14,377 |  16,416 |  15,360 |  7,299  \nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in 000’s) |  $ |  40,611 |  $ |  41,209 |  $ |  44,835 |  $ |  52,120 |  $ |  38,419 |  $ |  34,625 |  $ |  35,133 |  $ |  34,197 |  $ |  31,636 |  $ |  30,992 |  $ |  21,993  \n  \n**Trailing Twelve Months Ended**  \n---  \n**Mar 31,** |  **Jun 30,** |  **Sept 30,** |  **Dec 31,** |  **Mar 31,** |  **Jun 30,** |  **Sept 30,** |  **Dec 31,** |  **Mar 31,** |  **Jun 30,** |  **Sep 30,**  \n**2022** |  **2022** |  **2022** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2023** |  **2023** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2024**  \nSoftware Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s) |  $ |  72,997 |  $ |  85,796 |  $ |  97,581 |  $ |  84,578 |  $ |  80,538 |  $ |  76,252 |  $ |  75,801 |  $ |  68,401 |  $ |  69,494 |  $ |  71,033 |  $ |  65,366  \nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1) |  29,599 |  30,006 |  30,136 |  29,047 |  30,999 |  32,399 |  33,499 |  33,931 |  34,292 |  34,608 |  34,038  \nBroadbean Revenue included in Software Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s) |  — |  — |  — |  — |  — |  (1,716 |  ) |  (10,455 |  ) |  (19,117 |  ) |  (27,634 |  ) |  (34,608 |  ) |  (34,038 |  )  \nPro Forma Software Revenue (in 000’s) |  $ |  102,596 |  $ |  115,802 |  $ |  127,717 |  $ |  113,625 |  $ |  111,537 |  $ |  106,935 |  $ |  98,845 |  $ |  83,215 |  $ |  76,152 |  $ |  71,033 |  $ |  65,366  \nManaged Services Revenue (in 000’s) |  58,419 |  60,546 |  63,406 |  65,150 |  65,046 |  63,064 |  61,452 |  59,159 |  59,439 |  60,925 |  53,452  \nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in 000’s) |  $ |  161,015 |  $ |  176,348 |  $ |  191,123 |  $ |  178,775 |  $ |  176,583 |  $ |  169,999 |  $ |  160,297 |  $ |  142,374 |  $ |  135,591 |  $ |  131,958 |  $ |  118,818  \nPro Forma Total Number of Customers |  3,673 |  3,718 |  3,787 |  3,824 |  3,773 |  3,705 |  3,536 |  3,459 |  3,384 |  3,437 |  3,291  \nPro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue (in 000’s) (2) |  $ |  135,837 |  $ |  130,366 |  $ |  129,016 |  $ |  118,002 |  $ |  112,695 |  $ |  107,949 |  $ |  89,299 |  $ |  80,089 |  $ |  72,574 |  $ |  67,924 |  $ |  63,280  \n  \n(1) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” includes historical Software Products & Services Revenue from the past eleven (11) fiscal quarters of each of Veritone, Inc. and Broadbean and presents such revenue on a combined basis treating Broadbean as owned by Veritone, Inc. since January 1, 2022.

(NASDAQ:VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30,\n2024.\n“The divestiture of Veritone One marks a defining moment in our company's evolution, positioning us as a pure-play enterprise AI company at a pivotal time in the technology landscape,\"\nsaid Ryan Steelberg, Chief Executive Officer of Veritone. “With over 3,000 existing customers across Commercial and Public Sectors, we're now poised to capitalize on the unprecedented\ngrowth in the AI solutions market. As we look toward 2025, we're energized by our streamlined operational focus and enhanced ability to invest in innovation that will truly differentiate\nVeritone in the enterprise AI marketplace.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\nRevenue of $22.0 million, a decrease of 21% compared to Q3 2023.\nSoftware Products and Services revenues of $14.7 million, a decrease of 28% compared to $20.4 million in Q3 2023 driven by expected declines in consumption- based revenue\ncustomers, including Amazon and declines in one-time non-recurring software revenue.\nManaged Services revenue of $7.3 million as compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers of 3,291, down 7% year over year, as compared to September 30, 2023, largely driven by Commercial Enterprise, which began\nsunsetting legacy Career Builder customers following the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, offset by an increase across Public Sector from growth in public safety customers.\nTotal New Bookings of $16.5 million, up 17% sequentially from Q2 2024 and 6% year over year, as compared to Q3 2023.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) (as defined below) of $63.3 million, down from $89.3 million in Q3 2023 driven by declines in consumption-based revenue, including Amazon,\noffset by a slight increase from recurring subscription-based SaaS revenue customers.\nNet loss from Continuing Operations of $22.5 million, as compared to a loss of $26.7 million in Q3 2023 driven by lower overall operating expenses resulting from our past cost\nreduction plans and offset by decline in revenue.\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $15.7 million, a decrease of 25% or $5.3 million as compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to the decline in revenue.\nNon-GAAP gross margins of 71.2% as compared to 74.9% in Q3 2023.\nNet Loss of $21.7 million, as compared to $24.5 million in Q3 2023.\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $7.1 million, which was relatively flat as compared to Q3 2023.\nDivestiture of Veritone One, LLC\nThrough October 17, 2024 (the “Divestiture Closing Date”), we operated Veritone One, LLC (“Veritone One”), a full-service advertising agency, to provide differentiated Managed Services\nto our customers. On October 17, 2024, we sold all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P. (such transaction, the “Divestiture”).\nVeritone One’s services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics,\nspecializing in host-endorsed and influencer advertising across primarily radio, podcasting, streaming audio, social media and other digital media channels. We determined that the\nDivestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a material effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in this\nearnings release as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated.\nAbout Our Sales Pipeline\nOur sales pipeline represents revenue we expect to receive based on the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts outstanding at the end of the quarter and\ncontracts that we believe have a high probability of closing in the next three to twelve months. We include in our sales pipeline fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate\nof license fees that may fluctuate over the term and we do not include any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other\nvariable services) and any fees payable after contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of our customer. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more\nthan one year and may include professional fees required to enable our technology in certain environments we do not host or have direct control over. In some cases, our customers may\nhave the ability to terminate our agreements on short notice and our pipeline does not consider the potential impact of any early termination. No assurance can be given that we will\nultimately realize our full sales pipeline.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nUnaudited Percent Percent\n(in $000s) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 21,993 $ 27,968 (21)% $ 70,204 $ 72,883 (4)%\nLoss from operations $ (22,492) $ (25,183) 11% $ (67,167) $ (79,773) 16%\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (22,511) $ (26,732) 16% $ (72,072) $ (76,012) 5%\nNet loss $ (21,746) $ (24,541) 11% $ (69,175) $ (70,800) 2%\nNon-GAAP gross profit* $ 15,668 $ 20,942 (25)% $ 50,590 $ 51,502 (2)%\nNon-GAAP net loss from continuing operations* $ (11,097) $ (10,411) (7)% $ (31,139) $ (36,833) 15%\nNon-GAAP net loss* $ (7,113) $ (7,943) 10% $ (21,579) $ (30,523) 29%\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nUnaudited Percent Percent\n(in $000s, except customers) 2024 2023(1) Change 2024 2023(1) Change\nSoftware Products & Services\nSoftware Revenue* $ 14,694 $ 20,361 (28)% $ 45,549 $ 63,643 (28)%\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers(2) 3,291 3,536 (7)% 3,291 3,536 (7)%\nAnnual Recurring Revenue(3)* $ 63,280 $ 89,299 (29)% $ 63,280 $ 89,299 (29)%\nTotal New Bookings(4) $ 16,471 $ 15,501 6% $ 16,471 $ 15,501 6%\nGross Revenue Retention(5) >90% >90% >90% >90%\n(1)All of the supplemental financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of\nBroadbean (as defined below) as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a)\nBroadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited\ncompany incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized\n(société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n(2)“Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess\nof $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products &\nServices customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to\nbe under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products &\nServices Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or\npilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products &\nServices Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean.\n(3) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated\nquarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring\nand/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the\naggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical\ninformation of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022 where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue\nas described above instead of annual revenue. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual\nRecurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or\nconsumption-based revenues.\n(4)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and\nan estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other\nvariable services).\n(5) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3\nmonths in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services\nCustomers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software\nCustomer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services\nCustomers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated reflecting\nthe acquisition of Broadbean as if the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2022.\n* See tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to directly comparable GAAP measures and for the definitions used for Software Products & Services Supplemental\nFinancial Information.\nRecent Business Highlights\nPublic Sector\nClosed 13 new public safety and government customers, including the Department of Justice - Office of Public Affairs.\nSigned agreements with two of the largest counties in Southern California and a state-wide law enforcement agency.\nExpanded market reach with new strategic partnerships, including Nuix and international conglomerate, Getac.\nCommercial Enterprise\nSigned multi-year agreement with iHeartMedia, for expansion across their 850+ stations, enabling seamless and analytical process and review of unstructured audio data in\nnear-real time.\nSecured AWS Media and Entertainment Services Competency in Media Supply Chain and Data Science & Analytics, recognizing our specialized expertise, technical proficiency\nand proven success in helping customers transform their media and entertainment operations with innovative cloud-based AI solutions.\nSigned agreement with E.W. Scripps, enabling their Court TV media property to leverage Veritone’s AI platform to enhance the storage, management and distribution of its\nextensive content library.\nSigned multi-year agreement with ESPN to manage their content library and extended existing agreement with ESPN to utilize Veritone’s AI platform to track the impact on native\nadvertising placements and promotions, both spoken and visual, across multiple ESPN-owned channels.\nSigned a multi-year extension with the National Football League, providing searchable access to valuable sporting content to enrich its fan experience.\nSigned a multi-year agreement with the NCAA with a contract value of over $40 million.\nSigned multi-year enterprise deal with Big 4 accounting firm to build-out AI capabilities across its hiring platform.\nSigned several new enterprise programmatic advertising and job distribution software deals, including global brands such as Magna International, Shell Energy Australia, Marriott\nInternational, Ferrovial, Teleperformance, and Mitsubishi Chemical.\nCompleted the divestiture of our media agency, Veritone One, in October 2024, as described above.\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nDelivered third quarter revenue of $22.0 million, a decrease of $6.0 million or 21% from $28.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $14.7 million\ndecreased by $5.7 million or 28% year over year driven by expected declines in Commercial Enterprise principally from consumption based customers, including Amazon and one-time\nsoftware revenue in Q3 2023 that did not recur in Q3 2024. Managed Services revenue of $7.3 million was relatively flat when compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $22.5 million improving $4.42 million as compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the year over year improvement in loss\nfrom operations, coupled with a $1.6 million higher tax benefit from income in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.1 million decreased by 10% when compared to\nNon-GAAP net loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by the decline in Non-GAAP gross profit, which was partially offset by cost reductions enacted during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,291 was down 7% year over year relative to Total Software Product & Services Customers as of September\n30, 2023, principally due to declines in Commercial Enterprise from planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform, offset by increases in Public\nSector. Total New Bookings increased by 6% to $16.5 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings, offset by a\nreduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue of $63.3 million decreased 29% year over year driven in large part by the declines\nin Commercial Enterprise consumption spending from customers, offset by a slight increase year over year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue from subscription-based SaaS\ncustomers.\nBusiness Outlook\nFull Year 2024\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $92.5 million to $93.5 million, as compared to $100.0 million for the full year of 2023\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(37.5) million to $(36.5) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $(45.5) million for the full year of 2023.\nFull Year 2025\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $107.0 million to $122.0 million, as compared to the midpoint of $93.0 million for fiscal 2024.\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(25.0) million to $(15.0) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss midpoint of $(37.0) million for fiscal 2024.\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\nConference Call\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (5:30 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its third quarter 2024\nresults, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides\ncertain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring\nRevenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at\ninvestors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\nNon-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and\nnon-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation\nexpense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest\nexpense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance\nbonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss),\nnon-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the\nfinancial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income\n(expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measures.\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that\nare commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for\nforecasting and budgeting.

All of the supplemental financial information for this period reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired\nBroadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n(2) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone\ncompleted its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n(3) “Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess\nof $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products &\nServices customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the\nCompany to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software\nProducts & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products & Services\nCustomers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status\nwith us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services\nCustomers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services customers inclusive of Broadbean.\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products &\nServices customers, in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we\nprovided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers\nover the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)\nincludes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue.\nManagement uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of\nsubscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and\nmore volatile Consumption revenues.\n(5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products &\nServices customers, in each case, as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we\nprovided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers\nover the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue\n(Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above\ninstead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because\nBroadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate\nbetween predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n(6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and\nan estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other\nvariable services), in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n(7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products &\nServices Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from\nSoftware Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total\nCurrent Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all\nSoftware Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue\nRetention are calculated as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of revenue to pro forma revenue and the calculation of pro forma annual recurring revenue.\nQuarter Ended\nMar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30,\n2022 2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nSoftware Products & Services Revenue (in\n000’s) $ 18,167 $ 18,379 $ 20,812 $ 27,220 $ 14,127 $ 14,093 $ 20,361 $ 19,820 $ 15,220 $ 15,632 $ 14,694\nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1) 6,204 6,974 7,639 8,230 8,156 8,374 8,739 8,662 8,517 8,690 8,169\nBroadbean Revenue included in\nSoftware Products & Services Revenue\n(in 000’s) — — — — — (1,716) (8,739) (8,662) (8,517) (8,690) (8,169)\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in 000’s) $ 24,371 $ 25,353 $ 28,451 $ 35,450 $ 22,283 $ 20,751 $ 20,361 $ 19,820 $ 15,220 $ 15,632 $ 14,694\nManaged Services Revenue (in 000’s) 16,240 15,856 16,384 16,670 16,136 13,874 14,772 14,377 16,416 15,360 7,299\nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in 000’s) $ 40,611 $ 41,209 $ 44,835 $ 52,120 $ 38,419 $ 34,625 $ 35,133 $ 34,197 $ 31,636 $ 30,992 $ 21,993\nTrailing Twelve Months Ended\nMar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30,\n2022 2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nSoftware Products & Services\nRevenue (in 000’s) $ 72,997 $ 85,796 $ 97,581 $ 84,578 $ 80,538 $ 76,252 $ 75,801 $ 68,401 $ 69,494 $ 71,033 $ 65,366\nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1) 29,599 30,006 30,136 29,047 30,999 32,399 33,499 33,931 34,292 34,608 34,038\nBroadbean Revenue included in\nSoftware Products & Services\nRevenue (in 000’s) — — — — — (1,716) (10,455) (19,117) (27,634) (34,608) (34,038)\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in\n000’s) $102,596 $115,802 $127,717 $113,625 $111,537 $106,935 $ 98,845 $ 83,215 $ 76,152 $ 71,033 $ 65,366\nManaged Services Revenue (in 000’s) 58,419 60,546 63,406 65,150 65,046 63,064 61,452 59,159 59,439 60,925 53,452\nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in 000’s) $161,015 $176,348 $191,123 $178,775 $176,583 $169,999 $160,297 $142,374 $135,591 $131,958 $118,818\nPro Forma Total Number of Customers 3,673 3,718 3,787 3,824 3,773 3,705 3,536 3,459 3,384 3,437 3,291\nPro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue\n(in 000’s) (2) $135,837 $130,366 $129,016 $118,002 $112,695 $107,949 $ 89,299 $ 80,089 $ 72,574 $ 67,924 $ 63,280\n(1) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” includes historical Software Products & Services Revenue from the past eleven (11) fiscal quarters of each of Veritone, Inc. and Broadbean and\npresents such revenue on a combined basis treating Broadbean as owned by Veritone, Inc. since January 1, 2022.\n(2) “Pro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue” represents an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last period of the calculated quarter, combined with the trailing\ntwelve month calculation for all non-recurring and/or consumption based revenue for all active customers.\nVERITONE, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT TO LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLoss from operations $ (22,492) $ (25,183) $ (67,167) $ (79,773)\nSales and marketing 10,186 10,997 31,230 32,895\nResearch and development 7,528 10,410 23,388 32,456\nGeneral and administrative 14,421 18,264 45,133 48,837\nAmortization 6,025 6,454 18,006 17,087\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 15,668 $ 20,942 $ 50,590 $ 51,502\nNon-GAAP gross margin 71.2% 74.9% 72.1% 70.7%\nContacts\nCompany Contact:\nMike Zemetra\nChief Financial Officer\nVeritone, Inc.\ninvestors@veritone.com\nIR Agency Contact:\nCate Goldsmith\nProsek Partners\n914-815-7678\ncgoldsmith@prosek.com\nSource: Veritone, Inc."

Trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nForward-Looking Statements & Disclaimers\nThis presentation of Veritone, Inc. (the “Company”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “continue,” “can,” “may,” “confident”, “outlook”, “plans,” “potential,” “projects,”\n“seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those expressions may identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\nWe may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events\ncould differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation reflect our current views with\nrespect to future events, our business outlook for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and expectations for our business after the sale of Veritone One LLC.\nForward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this presentation. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\n30, 2024, and other periodic reports that we have filed and may in the future file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), particularly in the Risk Factors sections, that we believe could cause\nactual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Those factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited\ngrowth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our\noperations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key\ncustomers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or\nongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\nfluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our\nexisting products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third\nparty technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or\nsecurity issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the\nRussia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of\nrecession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-\nlooking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nBefore you invest, you should read our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the other documents we have filed and may in the future file\nwith the SEC for more complete information about the Company. You may obtain these documents for free on our website or by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\nThe historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in this earnings release as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a\nretrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout the presentation relate to the Company’s continuing operations.\nIn addition to our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables\ndetailing the items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Appendix.\nWe have provided these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts,\ninvestors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry.

In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone,\nInc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services\nCustomers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts.\nManagement uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive\nof Broadbean.\n“Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers,\ncombined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve-month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average\nAnnual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring\nRevenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue is on a Pro Forma basis where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual\nrevenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or\nconsumption-based revenues.\n“Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case on a Pro Forma basis. In prior\nperiods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and\nPandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of\nrecurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of\nsubscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n“Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, on a Pro Forma basis. In prior\nperiods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and\nPandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers\nand uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean\nsignificantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption\nrevenues.\n“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term),\nexcluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services).\n“Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such\nperiod, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software\nCustomer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products &\nServices Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis.\n“Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis.\n“Non-GAAP Gross Profit” is defined as revenue less cost of revenue.\n“Non-GAAP Gross Margin” is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue.\n29\nCopyright © 2024 Veritone, Inc.

However, Veritone has previously filed, or has publicly disclosed and will file, with the SEC, financial\nstatements for each of the above noted periods that were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying financial information is derived from the books and\nrecords of Veritone that were used to prepare those financial statements. Accordingly, the accompanying information\nshould be read in conjunction with Veritone’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the SEC\nfor each respective period. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results from operations, or any other\nsimilar period-to-period comparisons, should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance.\nThe accompanying financial information includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The items excluded from\nthese non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results and guidance with the Company’s\nmost directly comparable GAAP results and guidance are detailed on the following pages. The Company has provided\nthese non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important\nsupplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested\nparties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting\nand budgeting.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating\nincome (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from\noperating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define\nthese non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the\nhistorical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these\nnon-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in\naccordance with GAAP.\nVERITONE,

We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior\nYear Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the\nyear prior that is not lost to customer churn.\n5\nVERITONE, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL REVENUE BREAKDOWN AND COMPARISONS\n(Unaudited, Dollars in Thousands)\nQTD QTD YTD YTD\nRevenue by Business Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Q3 2024 Q3 2023\nCommercial Enterprise\nSoftware Products & Services 1 3,098 1 8,885 4 1,310 4 4,109\nManaged Services 7 ,299 7 ,607 2 4,658 2 4,302\nSub-total 2 0,397 3 3,657 6 5,968 6 8,411\nPublic Sector\nSoftware Products & Services 1 ,596 1 ,476 4 ,236 4 ,472\nManaged Services - - - -\nSub-total 1 ,596 1 ,476 4 ,236 4 ,472\nTotal revenue $ 2 1,993 $ 3 5,133 $ 7 0,204 $ 72,883\n6\nVERITONE, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT TO LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLoss from operations $ (22,492) $ (25,183) $ (67,167) $ (79,773)\nSales and marketing 1 0,186 1 0,997 3 1,230 3 2,895\nResearch and development 7 ,528 1 0,410 2 3,388 3 2,456\nGeneral and administrative 1 4,421 1 8,264 4 5,133 4 8,837\nAmortization 6 ,025 6 ,454 1 8,006 1 7,087\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 1 5,668 $ 2 0,942 $ 5 0,590 $ 5 1,502\n7\nVERITONE, INC.\nBreakdown and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Net Income from Discontinued Operations to GAAP Net Loss for Core Operations and Corporate from Discontinued Operations\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\n2024 2023\nCore Core\nOperations(1) Corporate(2) Total Operations(1) Corporate(2) Total\nNet income from discontinued operations $ 765 $ — $ 765 $ 2,191 $ — $ 2,191\nProvision for income taxes 26 — 26 26 — 26\nDepreciation and amortization 87 — 87 235 — 235\nStock-based compensation expense 82 — 82 79 — 79\nInterest expense, net 1,699 — 1,699 (96) — (96)\nAcquisition and due diligence costs(3) 1,292 — 1,292 — — —\nSeverance and executive transition costs(4) 33 — 33 33 — 33\nNon-GAAP net income from discontinued operations $ 3,984 $ — $ 3,984 $ 2,468 $ — $ 2,468\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n2024 2023\nCore Core\nOperations(1) Corporate(2) Total Operations(1) Corporate(2) Total\nNet income from discontinued operations $ 2,897 $ — $ 2,897 $ 5,212 $ — $ 5,212\nProvision for income taxes 76 — 76 51 — 51\nDepreciation and amortization 245 — 245 837 — 837\nStock-based compensation expense 237 — 237 443 — 443\nInterest expense, net 4,689 — 4,689 (321) — (321)\nAcquisition and due diligence costs (3) 1,369 — 1,369 — — —\nSeverance and executive transition costs(4) 47 — 47 88 — 88\nNon-GAAP net income from discontinued operations $ 9,560 $ — $ 9,560 $ 6,310 $ — $ 6,310\n(1) Core operations consists of our consolidated Software Products & Services and Managed Services that include our content licensing and representation services, and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating\nexpenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n(2) Corporate consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other\nexpenses that support the entire company, including public company driven costs.\n(3) From the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, acquisition and due diligence cost are comprised of professional fees realated to our acquisitions and divestitures.\n(4) Severance and executive transition cost consists of business realignment, severance and executive transition costs consists of severance and executive transition costs in 2024.\n8\nVERITONE, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP NET LOSS TO GAAP NET LOSS\n(Unaudited, in thousands)\nQ3: 2024 Q3: 2023\nNet income from discontinued operations $ 765 $ 2,191\nProvision for income taxes 26 26\nDepreciation and amortization 87 235\nStock-based compensation expense 82 79\nInterest expense, net 1,699 ( 96)\nAcquisition and due diligence costs (1) 1,292 -\nSeverance and executive transition costs (2) 33 33\nNon-GAAP net income from discontinued operations $ 3,984 $ 2,468\n(1) Acquisition and due diligence cost are comprised of professional fees realated to our acquisitions and divestitures.\n(2) Severance and executive transition cost consists of business realignment, severance and executive transition costs consists of severance and executive transition costs in 2024.\n9"

All statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Without\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “continue,” “can,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,”\n“projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those expressions may identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-\nlooking statements contain these identifying words. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, any statements that refer to projections of our future\nfinancial condition and results of operations, capital needs and financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth and market opportunities,\nacquisition, sale or divestiture plans and strategies, compensation plans, governance structure and policies and/or the price of our common stock.\nThe forward-looking statements included herein represent our management’s current expectations and assumptions based on information available as of the date of this\nreport. These statements involve numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be\nmaterially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause or contribute to such\ndifferences include, but are not limited to:\n▪our ability to continue as a going concern, including our ability to service our debt obligations as they come due over the next twelve months;\n▪our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business;\n▪declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies;\n▪our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such\ncapital on acceptable terms, if at all;\n▪our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other\nofferings;\n▪our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, sales, divestitures and other planned cost savings measures, including the sale of our full-service advertising\nagency, Veritone One (as defined below) and our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean (as defined in Note 3);\n▪our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n▪fluctuations in our results over time;\n▪the impact of seasonality on our business;\n▪our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets;\n▪our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments;\n▪actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it\ncost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform;\n▪interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers;\n▪the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial\ninstability, inflation and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around\nthe world;\n▪high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the threat of a recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and\npotential customers; and\n▪any additional factors discussed in more detail in “Item 1.

and per share data and percentages)\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nVeritone, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Veritone,” and together with its subsidiaries, collectively, the “Company”), is a provider of artificial intelligence (“AI”)\ncomputing solutions. The Company’s proprietary AI operating system, aiWARETM, uses machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together with a suite of powerful\napplications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. The aiWARE platform offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive\nfunctions such as perception, prediction and problem solving, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and\nanalyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights. aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be\nadded quickly and efficiently, resulting in a scalable and evolving solution that can be leveraged by organizations across a broad range of business sectors, serving\ncommercial enterprises as well as public sector industries.\nThe Company offers Software Products & Services to Commercial Enterprise and Public Sector customers using the Company’s aiWARE platform and Veritone Hire\nsolutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\nThe Company also offers Managed Services, which include cloud-native digital content management solutions and content licensing services and representation\nservices, through amongst other things, its VeriAds Network, which is comprised of programs that enable broadcasters, podcasters and social media influencers to generate\nincremental revenue. These offerings leverage the Company’s aiWARE technologies, providing customers with unique capabilities to enrich and drive expanded revenue\nopportunities from their content.\nThrough October 17, 2024 (the “Divestiture Closing Date”), the Company operated a full-service advertising agency to provide differentiated Managed Services to its\ncustomers. On October 17, 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Veritone One, LLC, a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Veritone One”), and Oxford Buyer, LLC (“Purchaser”), an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P., pursuant to which, among\nother things, Purchaser acquired from the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One (such transaction, the “Divestiture”). Veritone One’s services\nincluded media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics, specializing in\nhost-endorsed and influencer advertising across primarily radio, podcasting, streaming audio, social media and other digital media channels. The Company determined that\nthe Divestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a material effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Therefore, the historical financial results of\nVeritone One are reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for\nall periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. Refer to Note 3 on Discontinued Operations for further details.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company acquired Broadbean (as defined in Note 3), a global leader of talent acquisition software-as-a-service technology. For further details\non this acquisition, refer to Note 3.\nNOTE 2. PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial statements and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do\nnot contain all information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. Such unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes are based on the representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The information included in this\nForm 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the information included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with\nthe SEC on April 1, 2024. Interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results the Company will have for the\nfull year ending December 31, 2024.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of\nmanagement, reflect all adjustments that are normal, recurring and necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. All\nsignificant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements reflected in the three and nine month periods presented are unaudited. The December 31, 2023 balance sheet included herein was derived\nfrom the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures or notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\n8\nThe Company determined that Veritone One met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the historical financial results of Veritone One\nare reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods\npresented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. Refer to Note 3 on Discontinued Operations for further details.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles assuming the Company will continue\nas a going concern over the next twelve months through November 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany used cash in operations of $76,421 and $24,223, respectively, and incurred net losses of $58,625 and $69,175, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had an accumulated deficit of $499,071 and negative working capital of $83,872.\nBased on the Company’s liquidity position at September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the impact of the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our term loan,\nand the Company’s current forecast of operating results and cash flows, absent any other action, management determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, principally driven by the Company’s current debt\nservice obligations, historical negative cash flows and recurring losses. The Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months.\nOn the Divestiture Closing Date, the Company completed the sale of Veritone One for total consideration up to $104,000, subject to purchase price adjustments and\nthe achievement of certain earnout targets as described below. Net proceeds from the transaction were $59,053 in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of\n$104,000, less $18,000 subject to an earnout described below, $20,297 of purchase price adjustments, and $6,650 placed in escrow accounts described below. The Company\nmay receive the earnout of up to $18,000 in cash proceeds based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets by Veritone One between January 1, 2025 and December\n31, 2025 (the “Earnout”). Of the amounts placed in escrow, $1,500 was placed in an escrow account for potential purchase price adjustments and an aggregate of $5,150 was\nplaced in escrow accounts for the potential satisfaction of post-closing indemnification claims, in each case subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the Purchase\nAgreement. Net cash proceeds from the Divestiture were used to repay $30,512 principal amount of the Company’s outstanding Term Loan (defined in Note 4), plus\naccrued interest and a prepayment premium in an aggregate amount of $3,303, and to pay $3,875 in deal-related expenses. Immediately following the Divestiture and the\nrepayment of a portion of its Term Loan, the Company reported cash on hand of $27,289, and the Company improved its negative working capital as compared to\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nPotential future consideration from the Divestiture in the form of cash held in escrow and the Earnout is up to $24,650. With respect to the escrowed amounts,\n$1,500 is expected to be settled and may be released within 90 to 120 days after the Divestiture Closing Date, $3,650 is expected to settle and may be released 12 months\nafter the Divestiture Closing Date, and $1,500 is expected to settle and may be released 24 months after the Divestiture Closing Date. The Earnout, if applicable, is\nanticipated to be payable in part no later than March 2, 2026, with the remainder, if applicable, payable in the second quarter of 2026. While management believes a large\nportion of this potential future consideration will be earned and paid back to the Company over the next two years, both the escrowed amounts and Earnout are subject to\nfuture negotiation and financial performance of Veritone One, a portion of which the Company will have no direct control over. As a result, there is no guarantee that any of\nthe deferred consideration will be earned and or paid back to the Company. Given the Company’s forecast over the next twelve months, the Company will require additional\nliquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months.\nIn the near term, and to meet its obligations as they come due, the Company is evaluating additional strategies to obtain funding for future operations. These\nstrategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining equity financing, debt and/or further restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease operating expenses,\nwhich include capturing past cost reductions and potential future cost synergies from the Company’s past acquisitions.\nThe going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, including having sufficient\nliquidity in the future to meet, amongst other things, its covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 4). The Company may not be able to access\nadditional equity under acceptable terms, and may not be successful in future operational restructurings, earning any of its deferred purchase consideration, meeting its\nminimum liquidity threshold under its Credit Agreement or growing its revenue base. If the Company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, it may have to\ndispose of other or additional assets and might realize significantly less value than the values at which they are carried on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThese actions may cause the Company’s stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in the Company’s common stock. The condensed consolidated financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the Company being unable to continue as a going concern. If the Company cannot continue as a going\nconcern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of its assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be\nmaterial.\nUse of Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The principal estimates relate to the accounting recognition\nand presentation of revenue, allowance for credit losses, purchase\n9\naccounting, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, the valuation of senior secured debt, the valuation of non-cash consideration received in barter transactions and\nthe evaluation of its realizability, the valuation of certain assets, liabilities and costs allocated to discontinued operations, the valuation of stock awards and stock warrants\nand income taxes, where applicable.\nThere has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets due to a number of factors including the wars in Ukraine and Israel, the\nglobal inflationary environment and high interest rates. The war in Israel has also adversely impacted the Company’s business operations because the Company has an office\nand personnel based in Herzliya, Israel. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or assumptions or a\nrevision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThese estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. As a result, actual results could differ materially from\nthese estimates and assumptions.\nSignificant Customers\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in each case, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue. No\nindividual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and one individual customer accounted for\n10% or more of the Company’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in each case, no individual\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s accounts receivable.\nContract Balances\nContract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue when customer payments are received in advance of the Company meeting all the revenue recognition criteria.\nThe Company recognized $10,780 of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31,\n2023.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction prices under the Company’s contracts allocated to the Company’s remaining performance\nobligations was $36,488, approximately 55% of which the Company expects to recognize as revenue over the next twelve months, and the remainder thereafter to be\nrecognized over the next five years. This aggregate amount excludes amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts that have an original duration of\none year or less and variable consideration that is allocated to remaining performance obligations. Excluded based on this policy are balances related to Veritone Hire\nsolutions representing gross purchase orders to be satisfied in less than one year. Revenues will be recognized net of costs to fulfill these orders.\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates as one reportable segment. The Company reports segment information based on the internal reporting used by the chief operating decision\nmaker for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segment.\nSeasonality\nThe Company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenue and operating performance as a result of the utilization of its platform and associated revenues from\nits Software Products & Services. In particular, certain Commercial Enterprise solutions, including Veritone Hire revenues, have historically been higher in the second half\nof each fiscal year, consistent with the hiring and spending cycles of the Company’s larger customers. The Company also experiences seasonality as a result of factors such\nas the timing of large projects, the length and complexity of sales cycles, trends impacting the Company’s target vertical markets and the Company’s revenue recognition\npolicies and any changes to those policies. Within a given quarter, a higher proportion of the Company’s agreements are signed toward the end of such quarter. Although\nthese seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined that Veritone One (as defined above in Note 1) met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and\ndiscontinued operations. As a result, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued\noperations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. Refer to Note 3 on\nDiscontinued Operations for further details.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n10\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) which requires measurement and recognition of\nexpected credit losses for financial assets held. This standard was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The Company adopted this\nguidance on January 1, 2023 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements as credit losses are not expected to be\nsignificant based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of payment partners, and external market factors.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts\nwith Customers, which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in order to align the recognition of a contract liability with the definition of a performance obligation. The Company adopted\nthis guidance on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURE\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn August 8, 2024, the Company announced it was undertaking a formal process and had committed to a plan to sell Veritone One (defined in Note 1), which was\nsigned and closed on the Divestiture Closing Date. Veritone One operated the Company’s full-service advertising agency business and its disposal represents a strategic shift\nthat would have a major impact on the Company’s operations and financial results, as it enables the Company to focus on its core software and applications and reduce its\ndependency on advertising related services. As a result, Veritone One met both the held for sale and discontinued operations presentation criteria and comprised operations\nand cash flows that could be distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Company. See Note 13 on Subsequent Events for further\ndetails on the Divestiture and certain related transactions.\nIn connection with the Divestiture, the Company and the Purchaser entered into a transition services agreement. The transition services agreement outlines the\ninformation technology, people, and facility support the Company expects to provide to the Purchaser for a period of six months after the Divestiture Closing Date with\noptions to be extended. The total service fee amount for each service will not exceed the actual costs to provide such service.\nVeritone One’s results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 and its balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, are disclosed as discontinued operations and excluded from continuing operations within the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto,\nwith the resulting gain or loss from the sale to be accounted for during the reporting period in which the Divestiture was closed (see Note 13).\nSince the Company operates as one reporting unit, the Company allocated goodwill to discontinued operations on a relative fair value basis in comparison to the value\nof the overall company (see Note 7).\n11\nThe carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the Company's discontinued operations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were\nas follows (unaudited):\nAs of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAssets of discontinued operations\nCash and cash equivalents $ 34,496 $ 32,830\nAccounts receivable, net 34,167 38,415\nExpenditures billable to clients 37,158 19,608\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 8,151 6,593\nTotal current assets 113,972 97,446\nProperty, equipment and improvements, net 533 577\nGoodwill 26,718 26,718\nOther assets 7,339 10,687\nTotal assets $ 148,562 $ 135,428\nLiabilities of discontinued operations\nAccounts payable $ 15,321 $ 16,272\nAccrued media payments 107,149 94,584\nClient advances 34,937 15,240\nOther accrued liabilities 1,133 797\nTotal current liabilities 158,540 126,893\nTotal liabilities 158,540 126,893\nNet assets (liabilities) (9,978) 8,535\nIntercompany Balances\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had an intercompany balance due to the Divesture of $29,105, which was eliminated in consolidation as the amount was\nsettled and disposed of in full at the closing of the Divestiture. At the closing, the total amount of intercompany settlement was $20,297, which was netted against the purchase\nconsideration received. Due to the nature of transactions between Veritone One and our representation services, certain intercompany transactions that are planned to continue\nand were not settled at the closing date were reinstated in the corresponding financial periods, including certain accounts receivable from continuing operations and accrued\nmedia from discontinued operations, which were collectively $2,588 at September 30, 2024 and $3,239 at December 31, 2023.\nThe operating results of the Company's discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 8,615 $ 7,165 $ 23,032 $ 20,480\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue 342 161 679 380\nSales and marketing 1,744 1,895 5,178 5,811\nResearch and development 32 — 32 —\nGeneral and administrative 4,008 2,818 9,481 8,667\nAmortization — 170 — 680\nTotal operating expenses 6,126 5,044 15,370 15,538\nIncome from operations 2,489 2,121 7,662 4,942\nOther (expense) income, net (1,698) 96 (4,689) 321\nIncome from discontinued operations before provision for income taxes 791 2,217 2,973 5,263\nProvision for income taxes 26 26 76 51\nNet income from discontinued operations $ 765 $ 2,191 $ 2,897 $ 5,212\n12\nThe significant operating and investing cash and noncash items of the discontinued operations included in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (unaudited):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 1,868 (28,614)\nNet cash flows used in investing activities\n(202) (330)\nNet cash flows used in financing activities — —\nDepreciation and amortization allocated to discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $245 and $837, respectively.\nInterest expense (income), net allocated to discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4,689 and ($321), respectively. Stock\nbased compensation expense from discontinued operations was $237 and $443 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nBroadbean Acquisition\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company acquired Broadbean (as defined below), a global leader of talent acquisition software-as-a-service technology, pursuant to a securities\nand asset purchase agreement whereby the Company acquired (i) 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd, (b) Broadbean\nTechnology Limited, (c) Broadbean, Inc., and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)\ntogether, “Broadbean”). The acquisition is intended to strengthen Veritone’s AI-driven human resources product suite, building on the Company’s previous acquisition of\nPandoLogic.\nThe total purchase consideration was $53,301 (the “Broadbean Acquisition Consideration”), which consisted of cash payments of $53,301 at closing. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $4,214 in acquisition-related expenses. The following table summarizes the fair value of the Broadbean Acquisition\nConsideration:\nBroadbean Acquisition Consideration Amount\nCash consideration at closing $ 53,301\nThe allocation of the Broadbean Acquisition Consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values and is\nas follows:\nAllocation of Broadbean Acquisition Consideration** Amount\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,033\nAccounts receivable, net 7,817\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,007\nProperty, equipment and improvements, net 343\nIntangible assets 27,500\nOther assets 3,486\nTotal assets acquired 43,186\nAccounts payable 1,107\nDeferred revenue 10,029\nOther accrued liabilities 5,054\nOther non-current liabilities 6,618\nTotal liabilities assumed 22,808\nIdentifiable net assets acquired 20,378\nGoodwill 32,923\nTotal purchase consideration $ 53,301\n**The excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily\nattributable to opportunities to cross-sell into our Commercial Enterprise customer base and to the assembled workforce. Tax deductible goodwill generated from the\nacquisition is $3,728.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\n13\nThe identifiable intangible assets acquired consisted of the customer relationships and developed technology with estimated useful lives of four to five years. The\nCompany amortizes the fair value of these intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives.\nDeveloped technology relates to Broadbean’s internally developed software. The Company valued the developed technology using the relief- from- royalty method\nunder the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue that is expected to be generated by the existing developed\ntechnology. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to the developed technology, as well as the timing of cash flows over the forecast\nperiod. Customer relationships relate to the sales of products and services to Broadbean’s existing customer base. The Company valued the customer relationships using the\nmulti-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the\nexisting customer relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on historical\ncustomer turnover rates, as well as the timing of cash flows over the forecast period.\nThe valuation of the intangible assets acquired, along with their estimated useful lives, is as follows:\nEstimated Estimated Useful Lives (in\nFair Value years)\nCustomer relationships $ 17,200 5\nDeveloped technology 10,300 4\nTotal intangible assets $ 27,500\nTaxes\nIn connection with the acquisition of Broadbean, a net deferred tax liability of $3,741 was established primarily relating to non-goodwill intangible assets and\nrecorded within other non-current liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amount of tax-deductible goodwill as of the purchase date is\n$3,728.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Results\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for the Company and Broadbean as if the companies\nwere combined for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented included the\nbusiness combination accounting effects resulting from this acquisition, including adjustments to reflect recognition of intangible asset amortization. The unaudited pro forma\nfinancial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the\nacquisition had taken place at the beginning of January 1, 2023 or the results that may occur in the future.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenue $ 21,993 $ 27,968 $ 70,204 $ 87,946\nLoss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes (25,086) (27,735) (75,785) (77,149)\nNet loss (22,511) (26,732) (72,072) (73,855)\nEnergy Group Sale\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its energy group (the “Energy Sale”) to GridBeyond Limited, an Ireland-based privately held company\n(“GridBeyond”) that delivers AI-powered energy solutions, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The Company received 4,160,644 shares of Series B Preference Shares\nin GridBeyond valued at approximately $2,021 as of June 30, 2023, as well as $549 to be paid in cash. The Energy Sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $2,572 in the second\nquarter of 2023. The energy group did not meet the criteria of discontinued operations because the disposal does not have a major effect on the Company’s operations and\nfinancial results. In April 2024, the Company sold its interest in GridBeyond for $1,800 in cash, resulting in a loss on sale of $172 and a foreign exchange loss of $49,\nrecorded in other income (expense), net.\nNOTE 4. DEBT\nSenior Secured Term Loan\nOn December 13, 2023 (the “Term Loan Closing Date”), the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement\n(the “Credit Agreement”) with certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC and with certain other lenders (collectively, the “Lenders”) and Wilmington\nSavings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $77,500 senior secured term loan (the “Term Loan”), which\nwas fully drawn by the Company on the Term Loan\n14\nClosing Date. On the Term Loan Closing Date, the Company used $37,500 of the Term Loan proceeds to repurchase $50,000 principal amount of its Convertible Notes (as\ndefined below). As a result of the collective transactions at the Term Loan Closing Date, the Company recorded the Term Loan at fair value and recognized a one-time gain of\n$30,000 on the extinguishment of convertible debt. The initial discount on the Term Loan of $23,807 along with the capitalized issuance costs of $3,120 each will be\namortized to interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $1,465 and $4,217,\nrespectively, was recognized as the amortization of initial discounts and issuance costs.\nThe Company is the borrower under the Credit Agreement and all indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement is guaranteed by each of the Company’s\ndirect and indirect material subsidiaries (the Company and the guarantors, collectively, the “Credit Parties”). Pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated December\n13, 2023 (the “Pledge and Security Agreement”), the Term Loan is secured by a first-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all tangible and intangible property\nof the Credit Parties and a pledge of equity interests held by the Credit Parties. The Credit Agreement has certain customary default provisions, representations and warranties\nand affirmative and negative covenants, including a covenant to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $15,000 at all times. The Company was in\ncompliance with the financial covenants at September 30, 2024.\nThe Term Loan accrues interest at a rate of Term SOFR plus 8.50% per annum, with a 3.00% floor for Term SOFR, payable quarterly. A default interest rate of an\nadditional 3.00% per annum applies on all outstanding obligations after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default.\nThe Credit Agreement has a term of four years from the Term Loan Closing Date, with a scheduled maturity date of December 13, 2027, and requires quarterly\namortization payments of 2.50% of the principal amount, commencing in June 2024, with the outstanding balance of the Term Loan payable on the scheduled maturity date.\nThe Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds received by the Credit Parties for among other things (i) certain asset sales, but\nonly to the extent net cash proceeds therefrom exceed $10,000 in the aggregate, and (ii) insurance recoveries on loss of property that are not otherwise reinvested in other\nassets of the Credit Parties at a 10% prepayment premium. The Credit Agreement also requires prepayment of the Term Loan in full if $30,000 or more of aggregate principal\namount of the Convertible Notes are outstanding on August 14, 2026. The Company may elect to prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, in cash, subject to a make-whole\npremium during the first year of the Term Loan, a 14.0% prepayment premium during the second year of the Term Loan, and a 7.0% premium during the third year of the\nTerm Loan. The Term Loan is not repayable with the Company’s common stock, $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) as was initially set forth in the Commitment Letter\ndated November 7, 2023, by and among the Company, certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC and certain other lenders..\nOn the Term Loan Closing Date, the Company issued warrants (the “Warrants”) to the Lenders (in such capacity, the “Warrant Holders”) to purchase up to 3,008,540\nshares of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.576 per share with a termination date of December 12, 2028. Refer to Note 6 for further details about the\nWarrants.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense related to the Term Loan, including amortization of initial discounts and issuance costs, was\n$2,443 and $7,402, respectively. The effective annual interest rate was approximately 31.3%.\nInterest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on certain key elements of the underlying debt arrangement and transaction structure. Interest on debt\nthat is required to be repaid as a result of a disposal is allocated to discontinued operations, as is the case under the Credit Agreement. As a result, the Company allocated\ninterest expense and amortization of discounts and issuance costs relating to repayment of the Term Loan, as required by the Divestiture, to discontinued operations. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company allocated $1,698 and $4,931, respectively, of interest expense, including amortization of initial discounts and\nissuance costs, to discontinued operations as a result of the Divestiture.\nThe scheduled principal payments on the Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nRemainder of 2024 $ 1,938\n2025 7,750\n2026 7,750\n2027 56,188\nTotal 73,626\nIn October 2024, and in conjunction with the Divestiture, the Company used net proceeds from the sale to pay down $30,512 in principal and $3,303 in prepayment\npremiums and accrued interest on the Term Loan. Due to the classification of held-for-sale at September 30, 2024, and the proximity of the October 17, 2024 Divestiture to\nthe September 30, 2024 balance sheet, the Company classified the $30,512 million of\n15\ndebt paid down through the Divestiture as Term Loan, current portion on the September 30, 2024 balance sheet. As of the Repayment Date, after giving effect to the Term\nLoan Repayment, $43,114 aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the Term Loan and the Company had approximately $27,289 of cash and cash equivalents\n(see Note 13).\nConvertible Notes\nIn November 2021, the Company issued, at par value, $201,250 aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “Convertible Notes”).\nThe issuance included the full exercise of an option granted by the Company to the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes to purchase an additional $26,250 aggregate\nprincipal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to and are subject to the terms and conditions of an indenture, which is referred to as the\nIndenture, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Convertible Notes were offered and sold in a private offering to qualified institutional\nbuyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In December 2022, the Company repurchased $60,000 aggregate principal amount of the\nConvertible Notes at approximately 65% of par (the “2022 Repurchase Transaction”). In December 2023, the Company repurchased $50,000 aggregate principal amount of\nthe Convertible Notes at approximately 75% of par (the “2023 Repurchase Transaction”). The Company has $91,250 in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year. Interest accrues from November 19, 2021 and is\npayable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2022. The Convertible Notes will mature on November 15, 2026, unless\nearlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day\nimmediately preceding May 15, 2026, only under the following conditions: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2022\n(and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period\nof 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion\nprice on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading\nprice per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the\nCompany’s common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such Convertible Notes for redemption, at\nany time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified\ncorporate events. On or after May 15, 2026, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second\nscheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be,\ncash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election.\nThe conversion rate for the Convertible Notes initially is 27.2068 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes\n(equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $36.76 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be\nadjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or following the Company’s issuance of a\nnotice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with\nsuch a corporate event or who elects to convert its Convertible Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period, as the case may be.\nThe Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to November 20, 2024. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes\n(subject to certain limitations), at its option, on or after November 20, 2024 if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the\nconversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such\nperiod) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100%\nof the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the\nConvertible Notes.\nIf the Company undergoes a fundamental change prior to the maturity date, subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all\nor any portion of their Convertible Notes. The fundamental change repurchase price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Convertible Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly\nsubordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment with all existing and future\n16\nliabilities of the Company that are not so subordinated; effectively junior to any of secured indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such\nindebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) and any preferred equity of the Company’s current or future\nsubsidiaries.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes were approximately $194,945, after deducting debt issuance costs. The total debt issuance costs incurred\nand recorded by the Company amounted to $6,304, which were recorded as a reduction to the face amount of the Convertible Notes and are being amortized to interest\nexpense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are recorded as a liability within convertible senior\nnotes, non-current.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense related to the Convertible Notes, including amortization of issuance costs, was $543 and\n$1,627, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense related to the Convertible Notes, including amortization of issuance costs, was\n$836 and $2,503, respectively. The effective annual interest rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.42%. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes did not exceed the outstanding principal amount. As of September 30, 2024, the total estimated fair value\nof the Convertible Notes was $29,890, which was determined based on a market approach using actual bids and offers of the Convertible Notes in an over-the-counter market\nduring the period. The Company considers these assumptions to be Level 2 inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6.\nCapped Calls\nIn connection with the 2022 pricing of the Convertible Notes, with the full exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in\nNovember 2021, the Company used approximately $18,616 of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to enter into privately negotiated capped call\ntransactions, which are referred to as the capped calls, with various financial institutions.\nThe capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock underlying the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common\nstock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset some or all of any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of\nconverted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call\ntransactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes and is subject to anti-\ndilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of the Company’s\ncommon stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or\nthere would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. The initial\ncap price of the capped calls is $48.55 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of 75% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of\n$27.74 per share on November 16, 2021, and is subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the capped calls; provided that the cap price will not be reduced to\nan amount less than the strike price of $35.76 per share.\nThe capped call transactions are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes. The capped calls met the criteria for classification as\nequity and, as such, are not remeasured each reporting period and are included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital within stockholders’ equity.\nIn connection with the 2022 Repurchase Transaction, the Company entered into transactions to unwind a portion of the capped calls. As a result, the Company\nreceived $276 in net proceeds from the proceeds of the unwinding of the capped calls. In connection with the 2023 Repurchase Transaction, the Company entered into\ntransactions to unwind a portion of the capped calls. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the unwinding of the capped calls in 2023.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2023, the Company entered into a three year credit agreement with Alterna Capital Solutions, LLC (“ACS”) pursuant to which the Company might have\nborrowed up to $30,000 (the “ACS Credit Facility”). Loans under the ACS Credit Facility were secured by certain domestic receivables and other assets as determined by\nACS. The ACS Credit Facility bore interest at the greater of Prime rate plus 1.0% or 9.5%, and minimum annual interest of $250 if no funds are drawn under the ACS Credit\nFacility in a given year. ACS was a senior secured creditor.\nOn December 12, 2023, in connection with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement (as defined above), the ACS Credit Facility and the related Commercial\nGuarantee, dated August 8, 2023, were terminated. Immediately prior to its termination, no amounts were\n17\noutstanding under the ACS Credit Facility. The Company did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the ACS Credit Facility and\nrelated agreements.\nNOTE 5. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (22,511) $ (26,732) $ (72,072) $ (76,012)\nNet income from discontinued operations 765 2,191 2,897 5,212\nNet loss $ (21,746) $ (24,541) $ (69,175) $ (70,800)\nDenominator\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding\n38,086,765 36,991,650 37,752,562 36,810,878\nLess: Weighted-average shares subject to repurchase — — — —\nDenominator for basic and diluted net (loss) income per share 38,086,765 36,991,650 37,752,562 36,810,878\nBasic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations $ (0.59) $ (0.72) $ (1.91) $ (2.06)\nBasic and diluted net income per share from discontinued operations 0.02 0.06 0.08 0.14\nBasic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.57) $ (0.66) $ (1.83) $ (1.92)\nThe Company reported net losses for all periods presented and, as such, all potentially dilutive shares of common stock would have been antidilutive for such periods.\nThe table below presents the weighted-average securities (in common equivalent shares) outstanding during the periods presented that have been excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCommon stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units 10,555,192 11,058,562 10,729,798 10,909,888\nWarrants to purchase common stock 2,654,628 496,612 2,820,462 496,612\nCommon stock issuable in connection with convertible senior notes 2,482,621 3,842,961 2,482,621 3,842,961\n15,692,441 15,398,135 16,032,881 15,249,461\nNOTE 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Level\n1 and Level 2 are considered observable and Level 3 is considered unobservable, as follows:\n•Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n•Level 2—inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that\nare not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or\n18\n•Level 3—unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company’s money market funds are categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents\nwere as follows:\nGross Cash and\nUnrealized Fair Cash\nCost Losses Value Equivalents\nCash from continuing operations $ 11,422 $ — $ 11,422 $ 11,422\nCash from discontinued operations 34,496 — 34,496 34,496\nTotal $ 45,918 $ — $ 45,918 $ 45,918\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balances were as follows:\nGross Cash and\nUnrealized Fair Cash\nCost Losses Value Equivalents\nCash from continuing operations $ 46,609 $ — $ 46,609 $ 46,609\nCash from discontinued operations 32,830 — 32,830 32,830\nTotal $ 79,439 $ — $ 79,439 $ 79,439\nPurchase Consideration\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of PandoLogic, Ltd. (“PandoLogic”), a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Israel, pursuant to\nan Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 21, 2021 (the “PandoLogic Merger Agreement”). The total purchase consideration for PandoLogic included up to $65,000\nin contingent consideration based on achieving certain contingent consideration tied to financial performance of PandoLogic in fiscal 2021 and 2022, which amounts were\npayable in a combination of cash and common stock (the “PandoLogic Contingent Consideration”). At December 31, 2023, all Pandologic Contingent Consideration had been\npaid.\nAll of the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, except when the amount of the payout is\ndetermined to be fixed. Contingent consideration for the PandoLogic acquisition was valued at the time of acquisition using Monte Carlo simulation models. These models\nincorporate contractual terms and assumptions regarding financial forecasts for PandoLogic, discount rates, and volatility of forecasted revenue. The value of the Company’s\ncontingent consideration would increase if a lower discount rate was used and would decrease if a higher discount rate was used. Similarly, a higher revenue volatility\nassumption would increase the value of the contingent consideration, and a lower revenue volatility assumption would decrease the value of the contingent consideration.\nContingent consideration for the March 2022 Acquisition (as defined below) was valued at the time of acquisition using a simple probability of achievement model, with the\nprobability of achievement based on management’s forecasted outcomes for 2022 and 2023 fiscal year results for the acquired entity. The development and determination of\nthe unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company’s management with the assistance of a third-\nparty valuation specialist when deemed necessary.\nIn September 2022, the Company and PandoLogic’s former owners entered into an amendment to the PandoLogic Merger Agreement. This amendment provides that\nthe PandoLogic Contingent Consideration would be no less than $10,825, irrespective of the actual financial performance of PandoLogic for the PandoLogic Contingent\nConsideration period. All of the PandoLogic Contingent Consideration was paid during the year ended December 31, 2023 in a combination of cash consideration and stock\nconsideration, with the number of shares paid equal to that stock consideration portion of the contingent consideration amount divided by a price per share of $20.53 in\naccordance with the terms of the PandoLogic Merger Agreement.\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of an influencer-based management company (the “March 2022 Acquisition”). As part of the consideration, the seller\nwas eligible to receive up to $4,500 in cash (the “March 2022 Acquisition Consideration”). In July 2023, the Company entered into an agreement amending the March 2022\nAcquisition Consideration (the “March 2022 Acquisition Amendment”). The March 2022 Acquisition Amendment provides that the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration\nwas reduced to $3,500 and payment of the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration amount is now tied to employment status of the seller through December 31, 2025,\nirrespective of the actual financial performance of the acquired company, the remainder of which is to be paid ratably over the service period. As the amount became fixed\nunder the March 2022 Acquisition Amendment, the Company determined that the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration amount should no longer be categorized as Level 3\nwithin the fair value hierarchy at the time of the amendment.\n19\nThere are no contingent consideration liabilities outstanding as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities\ncurrent and non-current balances were as follows:\nFair Value as of Changes in Amount Paid Fair Value as of\nDecember 31,\nJanuary 1, 2023 Fair Value To Date 2023\nLevel 3:\nContingent consideration, current $ 8,067 $ 1,651 $ (8,718) $ 1,000\nContingent consideration, non-current — 633 — 633\nTotal $ 8,067 $ 2,284 $ (8,718) $ 1,633\nStock Warrants\nOn the Term Loan Closing Date (as defined in Note 4 above), the Company issued warrants to the Lenders (in such capacity, the “Warrant Holders”) to purchase up to\n3,008,540 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0 and 499,857 of these warrants were net settled in\nexchange for 0 and 298,110 shares of Common Stock, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Warrant Holders held warrants to purchase 2,508,683 shares of Common\nStock.\nAll of the Company’s outstanding stock warrants are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Stock warrants are equity classified and have been\nrecorded at their fair value, on their issuance date of December 13, 2023, using either a probability weighted expected return model, the Monte Carlo simulation model or the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model. These models incorporate contractual terms, maturity, risk-free interest rates and volatility. The value of the Company’s stock warrants\nwould increase if a higher risk-free interest rate was used and would decrease if a lower risk-free interest rate was used. Similarly, a higher volatility assumption would\nincrease the value of the stock warrants, and a lower volatility assumption would decrease the value of the stock warrants. The development and determination of the\nunobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company’s management with the assistance of a third-party\nvaluation specialist.\nInvestments\nThe Company holds a strategic investment in a technology company that was determined to not have a readily determinable fair value. This investment is carried at a\ncost of $2,750 on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets within other assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is categorized as Level 3\nwithin the fair value hierarchy.\nAs part of the Energy Sale, the Company acquired a strategic investment in GridBeyond that was determined not to have a readily determinable fair value. This\ninvestment was carried at a cost equal to its initial estimated fair value of $2,021 on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets within other assets as of December\n31, 2023, with that initial estimated fair value based on third party valuation at the time of the transaction and was categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In\nApril 2024, the Company sold its investment in GridBeyond for $1,800 in cash, resulting in a loss on sale of $172 and a foreign exchange loss of $49, recorded in other\nincome (expense), net.\nBecause these investments do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company has elected to measure these investments under ASC 321, Investments – Equity\nSecurities, at cost minus impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. No\nimpairment was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company determined that\ngoodwill was not impaired, as the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Additionally, as of June 30, 2024, the Company\nperformed a quantitative analysis of the recoverability of each of the Company’s asset groups. The result of the analyses was that the assets were not impaired, as the expected\ncash flows exceeded the carrying value for each asset group.\n21\nNOTE 8.

Inherent in the assessment of the\nallowance for credit losses are certain judgments and estimates relating to, among other things, the Company’s customers’ access to capital, customers’ willingness and\nability to pay, general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with customers. The Company calculates the expected credit losses on a pool basis for those\nreceivables that have similar risk characteristics aligned with the types of accounts receivable listed in the accounts receivable table above. Allowances have been recorded\nfor receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues. The allowance for expected credit losses is\ndetermined by analyzing the Company’s historical write-offs and the current aging of receivables. Adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods\ndepending on how issues considered such as the financial condition of customers and the general economic climate may change or if the financial condition of the\nCompany’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments.

During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, 28.9% and 28.4%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the U.S., principally from customers\nlocated throughout Western Europe, as compared to 23.5% and 10.8% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n24\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest expense, net $ (2,987) $ (314) $ (8,485) $ (2,064)\nGain (loss) on sale — — (172) 2,572\nOther 393 (2,238) 39 580\nOther income (expense), net $ (2,594) $ (2,552) $ (8,618) $ 1,088\nOther in the table above consists of foreign exchange gains of $393 and losses of $2,294 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\nforeign exchange gains of $29 and $526 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740-270, Income Taxes, the provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company’s\nannual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the Company updates the estimate of the annual\neffective tax rate, and if the estimated tax rate changes, the Company records a cumulative adjustment. A separate estimated annual effective tax rate is applied for\njurisdictions where an entity anticipates an ordinary loss or has an ordinary loss for the year to date for which no tax benefit can be recognized.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.3% and 4.9%, respectively. The difference between the effective\ntax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% is primarily due to a valuation allowance established on the Company’s domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets, as\nwell as the impact of foreign operations subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was\n3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year periods\nis primarily due to the impact of taxes on foreign operations and valuation allowances against domestic net deferred tax assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had net deferred tax liabilities of $4,387 and $9,504, respectively, which is included in other non-\ncurrent liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to provide a valuation allowance against federal and state\ndeferred tax assets that are not expected to be realizable. The Company continues to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. If the\nCompany’s assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, the Company would record the related adjustment to income\nduring the period in which the determination is made.\nAs a result of the Broadbean acquisition, the Company expects to be subject to taxation in France and Australia, in addition to already being subject to taxation in the\nUnited States, Israel, and the United Kingdom. The United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom comprise the majority of the Company’s operations. In general, the U.S.\nfederal statute of limitations is three years. However, the Internal Revenue Service may still adjust a tax loss or credit carryover in the year the tax loss or credit carryover is\nutilized. As such, the Company’s U.S. federal tax returns and state tax returns are open for examination since inception. The Israeli statute of limitations period is generally\nfour years commencing at the end of the year in which the return was filed. The UK statute of limitations period is typically twelve months following the date on which the\nreturn is filed. The Company’s 2022 U.S. federal tax return for Pandologic, Inc. is currently under examination. There are no other ongoing examinations from income tax\nauthorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business.\n25\nNOTE 9.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nOn January 4, 2023, the Company entered into an independent contractor services agreement with Steel Holdings, LLC, effective as of January 1, 2023 the Steel\nHoldings Consulting Agreement. Steel Holdings, LLC is an entity affiliated with Chad Steelberg, currently a director serving on the Company’s Board, and formerly its\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Under the Steel Holdings Consulting Agreement, the Company retained Mr. Steelberg as a consultant to provide ongoing\nChief Executive Officer transition services and to manage and oversee the further development of the Company’s aiWARE platform.\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into the Amended Consulting Agreement, which supersedes and replaces the Steel Holdings Consulting Agreement. Pursuant\nto the Amended Consulting Agreement, Mr. Steelberg will provide technical advisory services related to the Company’s software, software architecture and technology\nstrategy as requested by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer until December 31, 2025, the termination date of the Amended Consulting Agreement. In consideration for\nsuch services, the Company agreed to pay to Steel Holdings, LLC (i) $1,000 in cash on July 1, 2024 and (ii) $50 per month in cash for the period from January 2024 through\nDecember 2025. The Company will reimburse Steel Holdings, LLC for reasonable and documented expenses incurred in connection with providing the services in accordance\nwith the Company’s standard travel and expense policies. All equity grants that were made, including the unvested Steel Holdings Consulting PSUs, or contemplated under\nthe Steel Holdings Consulting Agreement were terminated as of the effective date of the Amended Consulting Agreement and no further performance stock units will be\nissued under the Amended Consulting Agreement, except that the vested Steel Holdings Consulting PSUs remained outstanding.\nThe Amended Consulting Agreement may be terminated by either party with 90 days’ notice. If the Company terminates the Amended Consulting Agreement for any\nreason other than Steel Holdings, LLC’s material breach, then any remaining cash compensation payments under the Amended Consulting Agreement will become due and\npayable. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan), the Amended Consulting Agreement will terminate as of the effective date of the\nChange in Control and any remaining cash compensation payments will become due and payable.\nThe Company has determined that all future payments under the Amended Consulting Agreement are probable and estimable, and that substantially all benefits earned\nunder the agreement relate to past services rendered. As such, the Company has accrued a liability for all future cash payments under the agreement on its condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, and recognized a resulting acceleration charge of $0 and $1,484 to general and administrative expenses to its condensed\nconsolidated income statement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, one of the Company’s subsidiaries rented a property owned by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer in connection with certain\npromotional event services on behalf of one of its customers. Total consideration paid was less than $100.\n30\nNOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Divestiture\nOn the Divestiture Closing Date, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement, by and among the Company, Veritone One and the Purchaser, an affiliate of\nInsignia Capital Group L.P., pursuant to which, among other things, the Purchaser acquired from the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One for a\ntotal purchase price of up to $104,000, subject to purchase price adjustments and the achievement of the Earnout targets described below. The Divestiture was structured as a\nsimultaneous “sign and close” transaction and closed on the Divestiture Closing Date. On the Divestiture Closing Date, the Company received cash proceeds of $59,053,\nwhich reflected the aggregate purchase price of $104,000, less $18,000 subject to the Earnout described below, $20,297 of purchase price adjustments, and $6,650 placed in\nescrow accounts described below. Of the amounts placed in escrow, $1,500 was placed in an escrow account for potential purchase price adjustments and an aggregate of\n$5,150 was placed in escrow accounts for the potential satisfaction of post-closing indemnification claims (the “Indemnity Escrow”), in each case subject to the terms and\nlimitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Company may receive up to an additional $18,000 in cash proceeds in the Earnout, subject to the achievement of certain\nnet revenue targets by Veritone One between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025 (as further described in the Purchase Agreement).\nThe Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of each of the parties to the Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also\nincludes indemnification provisions whereby the Company will indemnify the Purchaser and other related indemnified parties for losses arising out of, among other things,\ninaccuracies in, or breaches of, the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company or Veritone One. The Purchaser and the other related indemnified parties will\nbe able to make post-closing indemnification claims against the Indemnity Escrow, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In addition,\nunder the Purchase Agreement, the Company is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation provisions pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed not\nto engage in certain competitive activities with respect to Veritone One’s business or solicit Veritone One employees or customers for a period of four years following the\nDivestiture.\nTerm Loan Repayment\nOn October 22, 2024 (the “Repayment Date”), the Company used net cash proceeds from the Divestiture to repay $30,512 principal amount of its outstanding Term\nLoan, plus accrued interest and a prepayment premium in of $3,303 (collectively, the “Term Loan Repayment”). As of the Repayment Date, after giving effect to the Term\nLoan Repayment, $43,114 aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the Term Loan and the Company had approximately $27,289 of cash and cash equivalents.\nDue to the classification of held-for-sale at September 30, 2024, and the proximity of the October 17, 2024 Divestiture to the September 30, 2024 balance sheet, the\nCompany classified the $30,512 million of debt paid down through the Divestiture as Term Loan, current portion on the September 30, 2024 balance sheet.\n31\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking\nstatements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements as a result of various factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors,” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, “Risk Factors,” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and any updates thereto set forth\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including future SEC filings. See “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\nVeritone, Inc., collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as “Veritone,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us,” is a provider of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) solutions,\npowered by our proprietary AI operating system, aiWARE™, to deliver differentiated products and solutions to our Commercial Enterprise and Public Sector (which we\npreviously referred to as Government & Regulated Industries) customers. Our Software Products & Services consist of revenues generated from Commercial Enterprise and\nPublic Sector customers using our aiWARE platform and Veritone Hire solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services\nassociated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions. Our Managed Services consist of revenues generated from Commercial Enterprise customers using our\ncontent licensing and representation services, including influencer management and related operations.\nThrough October 17, 2024, we operated a full-service advertising agency through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritone One (as defined below), that provided Managed\nServices to its customers. On October 17, 2024, we sold all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One, LLC (formerly, Veritone One, Inc., referred herein\ncollectively as “Veritone One”) to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P., pursuant to which, among other things, Purchaser acquired from the Company all of the issued and\noutstanding equity of Veritone One (such transaction, the “Divestiture”). The historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in these condensed consolidated financial\nstatements as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of $22.0 million and $70.2 million, respectively, as compared to $28.0 million and\n$72.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our Software Products & Services revenue was $14.7 million during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to $20.4 million for the same period in 2023, while our Managed Services revenue was $7.3 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $7.6 million for the same period in 2023. Our Software Products & Services revenue was $45.5 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $48.6 million for the same period in 2023, while our Managed Services revenue was $24.7 million during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 as compared to $24.3 million for the same period in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no customer represented more than 10% of\nour consolidated revenue. During the three and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our largest customer represented less than 10% and 12%, respectively, of our\nconsolidated revenue.\nRecent Developments\nAppointment of Ryan Steelberg as Chairman. Ryan Steelberg, our Chief Executive Officer, was appointed Chairman of the Board, effective January 22, 2024, replacing Chad\nSteelberg who resigned as Chairman of the Board on the same date. Chad Steelberg continues to serve as a member of our Board.\nOperational Realignment and Restructuring. During the first quarter of 2024, we enacted certain operational and restructuring initiatives (the “Q1 2024 Restructuring”). As a\nresult of the Q1 2024 Restructuring, we expect to reduce our annualized operating expenses by approximately $13.0 million. We have continued with additional cost reductions\nin the second half of 2024, which when combined with our Q1 2024 Restructuring, we expect will result in over $40.0 million of net annualized strategic cost reductions. We\nincurred $3.9 million in one-time severance and transition expenses in connection with the Q1 2024 Restructuring, all of which was paid as of September 30, 2024 and we have\nincurred approximately $1.4 million in related one-time severance and transition costs for our cost reduction initiatives after the Q1 2024 Restructuring of which $0.3 million\nwas paid as of September 30, 2024. The cumulative results of these initiatives was an approximate 19% reduction in our global workforce.\nElection of Michael Keithley as a Class I Director. On June 13, 2024, at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”), Michael Keithley was elected as a\nClass I Director for a three-year term expiring at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders in 2027. Jeffrey P. Gehl resigned as a member of the Board of Directors\nimmediately prior to the commencement of the Annual Meeting.\nDivestiture of Media Agency. On October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture for a total purchase price of up to $104.0 million. The Divestiture was strategic, allowing\nus to focus on our AI solutions, and secondarily to improve our financial liquidity with the net proceeds from the Divestiture. Net proceeds from the transaction were $59.1\nmillion in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of $104.0\n32\nmillion, less $18.0 million subject to an earnout described below, $20.3 million of purchase price adjustments, and $6.7 million placed in escrow accounts. We may receive the\nearnout of up to $18.0 million in cash proceeds based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets by Veritone One between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. On\nOctober 22, 2024, we used net cash proceeds from the Divestiture to repay $30.5 million principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan, plus accrued interest and a\nprepayment premium in the aggregate amount of $3.3 million, and $3.9 million in deal-related expenses. As of October 22, 2024, immediately following the repayment of a\nportion of our Term Loan, we reported cash on hand of $27.3 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we determined that Veritone One met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the historical financial results of\nVeritone One are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements herein as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations\nfor all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. See Note 3 on Discontinued Operations for more information.\nOpportunities, Challenges and Risks\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived our revenue primarily through our Commercial Enterprise customers, and secondarily,\nthrough our Public Sector customers.\nWe are a leader in AI-based Software Products & Services. Our proprietary AI operating system, aiWARE, uses machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together\nwith a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. Historically, we have derived a large portion of our\nSoftware Product & Services revenue from applications we internally developed from our aiWARE platform and actively sell to various customers. While management believes\nthere is a substantial opportunity to increase revenue longer term, current economic conditions have negatively impacted parts of our consumption-based operations and\nfinancial results, and there is no certainty that any future investments, which could be significant and include future potential acquisitions, will result in significant enterprise\nrevenue realization or revenue growth when compared with historical revenue. Nevertheless, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in Software Products &\nServices and our aiWARE platform sales to existing and newly acquired customers, and where our AI solutions could add near and long-term value in the Public Sector\nindustries and content creation and distribution across the global media and entertainment industry.\nWe believe there are significant near and long-term revenue and growth opportunities from our Software Products & Services. In June 2023, we completed the\nacquisition of Broadbean, a leader in subscription-based talent acquisition software-as-a-service which has approximately 3,000 subscription-based customers based throughout\nthe world, integrated with over 100 applicant tracking systems (“ATS”) and has direct access to over 2,500 job boards globally. The acquisition of Broadbean was strategic to\nour growth across our Veritone Hire applications, as we plan in the near term to offer our existing product offerings to Broadbean’s 3,000 customers, including programmatic\nadvertising capabilities. Over the long term, we plan to utilize our AI capabilities to analyze complex data sets through direct access to these ATS, including future integration\nwith aiWARE. In Public Sector markets, we see significant near and long term growth opportunities with customer adoption of our aiWARE platform, including our recently\nannounced iDEMS solution, to facilitate and improve existing and growing demand for more robust digital evidence management systems and services across the entire public\nsafety industry, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer and Department of Defense. However, many enterprise-level\nopportunities with Public Sector customers can involve long sales cycles, during which we must invest significant time and resources without a guarantee of success.\nGrowing our existing and new Software Products & Services customer base is critical for our success. Software Products & Services revenue decreased by 6.2% during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period due to lower consumption across our Commercial Enterprise customer base, including Amazon\nand certain one-time software revenue recognized in 2023 that did not recur at the same rate in 2024, partially offset by the addition of Broadbean in the second quarter of 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue as compared to one customer that represented 12% of\nour consolidated revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAs a result of the recent pullback in the macroeconomic environment caused by high inflation, high interest rates, higher unemployment and geopolitical factors\nincluding the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the war in Israel, some of our customers reduced consumption-based spending across our Commercial Enterprise customer base,\nnamely from our Veritone Hire solutions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total Software Products & Services customers declined to 3,291, which was a decrease of 6.9% as compared to the end of the third\nquarter of 2023. The decrease in customers was largely driven by planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform, which did not have\na significant impact on our financial results in 2023 or for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. To continue our effort to grow our customer base and overall revenue,\nwe have been investing aggressively in existing customers and acquiring new customers. In addition, in February 2024, we announced certain cost reduction and restructuring\ninitiatives, the results of which was a reduction in our global workforce of approximately 13% as of September 30, 2024. Since the first quarter of 2023, we have been actively\nrealigning and restructuring our organization, which, as of September 30, 2024, is expected to result in over $40.0 million of net annualized strategic cost reductions, which\nincludes expected cost reductions from our Q1 2024 Restructuring along with\n33\nadditional cost reductions made in the second half of 2024. As a result of our efforts to diversify our customer base and increase sales within our existing customer base, as well\nas the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, we increased our sales and marketing spending in the near term as compared to the trailing twelve months; however, these increased\ninvestments were partially offset by our 2023 and 2024 cost-reduction initiatives.\nWe believe our Software Products & Services will extend the capabilities of many third-party software platforms and products that are widely used today. For example,\nwe believe that, when integrated with aiWARE, our Veritone Hire solutions customers will be given greater visibility and transparency in their hiring processes. Further and\nwith the recently announced iDEMs launch, we now offer a suite of aiWARE applications to address the growing issue of unstructured digital data management faced by public\nsafety and federal government sectors today. In addition, we recently announced that we achieved Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) Advanced Tier Services status, advancing\nthe deployment of our AI solutions and capabilities across the AWS platform, and we have historically integrated aiWARE across many platforms, including Alteryx,\nSnowflake and the NVIDIA® CUDA® GPU-based platform, enabling dramatic increases in aiWARE’s processing speed and providing a wide range of new use cases for our\ntechnology. We are in the process of developing and marketing more specific use cases for these and future integrations, which we believe will open up new markets for our\nproducts and accelerate our long-term revenue growth opportunities.\nWe believe our operating results and performance are, and will continue to be, driven by various factors that affect our industry. Our ability to attract, grow and retain\ncustomers for our aiWARE platform is highly sensitive to rapidly changing technology and is dependent on our ability to maintain the attractiveness of our platform, content\nand services to our customers. Our future revenue and operating growth will rely heavily on our ability to grow and retain our Software Products & Services customer base,\ncontinue to develop and deploy quality and innovative AI-driven applications and enterprise-level offerings, provide unique and attractive content and related services to our\ncustomers, continue to grow in newer markets such as Public Sector, expand aiWARE into larger and more expansive enterprise engagements and manage our corporate\noverhead costs. While we believe we will be successful in these endeavors, we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in generating substantial long term operating growth and\nprofitability.\nHistorically, we have pursued an opportunistic strategy of acquiring companies to help accelerate our organic growth. Our acquisition strategy has been threefold: (i) to\nincrease the scale of our business in markets we are in today, (ii) to accelerate growth in new markets and product categories, including expanding our existing engineering and\nsales resources, and (iii) to accelerate the adoption of aiWARE as the universal AI operating system through venture or market-driven opportunities. While we believe there are\nstrategic acquisition targets that can accelerate our entry into and expand our existing market share in key strategic markets, as well as our ability to grow our business, there is\nno certainty our historical or future acquisitions will achieve these objectives. Conversely, we have pursued and may continue to pursue opportunistic sales of certain business\noperations that are not strategic to us long-term, such as the divestitures of our Energy Group in the second quarter of 2023 and our media agency in October 2024.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenues were $22.0 million and $70.2 million, respectively, as compared to $28.0 million and\n$72.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a decrease of 21.8% and 3.7%, respectively, over the prior year periods. For the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, our total loss from operations was $22.5 million and $67.2 million, respectively, as compared to $25.2 million and $79.8 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, an improvement of 10.7% and 15.8%, respectively, over the prior year periods. For the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, our non-GAAP gross margin (calculated as described in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) was approximately 71.2% and 72.1%,\nrespectively, as compared to 74.9% and 70.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, driven in large part by decreased customer margins and\nthe mix of revenue as compared to the prior year periods. Our non-GAAP gross margin is impacted significantly by the mix of our Software Products & Services and our\nManaged Services revenue in any given period because our Managed Services revenue typically has a lower overall non-GAAP gross margin than our Software Products &\nServices revenue. Our non-GAAP gross profit (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) is also dependent upon our ability to grow our revenue by expanding our customer\nbase and increasing business with existing customers, and to manage our costs by negotiating favorable economic terms with cloud computing providers such as AWS and\nMicrosoft Azure. While we are focused on continuing to improve our non-GAAP gross profit, our ability to attract and retain customers to grow our revenue will be highly\ndependent on our ability to implement and continually improve upon our technology and services and improve our technology infrastructure and operations as we experience\nincreased network capacity constraints due to our growth.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $22.6 million and $72.1 million, respectively, as\ncompared to a net loss of $26.8 million and $ 79.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we reported a non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $11,097 and $31,139, respectively, as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $10,411 and\n$36,833 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. To continue to grow our revenue, we will continue to make targeted investments in people,\nnamely software engineers and sales personnel. Historically, we have also made investments in our corporate infrastructure, including new ERP and workforce systems to help\nus better manage the scale and growth of our business. However, considering the current challenging macro-economic environment, we have made and are continuing to make\nsignificant cost reductions to our operating structure to better\n34\nstreamline our business and prioritization around our growth and corresponding investments throughout 2024 and into 2025. These cost reduction initiatives began in the latter\nhalf of 2022 and will continue through 2024 and 2025, and include reductions in workforce and certain legacy operating costs, as well as the integration of past acquisitions. As\na result of these initiatives, we believe we will be able to accelerate our pathway toward long term profitability.\nWith the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, we expanded our customer base throughout Europe and Asia Pacific. During the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, 28.9% and 28.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the U.S., principally from customers located throughout Western Europe,\nas compared to 23.5% and 10.8% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity for us to continue\nexpanding our service offerings and customer base in countries outside of the United States. In the long term, we plan to expand our business further internationally in places\nsuch as Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and as a result, we expect to continue to incur significant incremental upfront expenses associated with these expansion\nopportunities.\nImpact of Current Global Economic Conditions\nGlobal economic and business activities continue to face uncertainty as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, labor shortages, inflation rates, the U.S.\npresidential election and responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts, recession risks, disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and\nthe war in Israel. In particular, business operations at our Herzliya office location where we do development work on our Veritone Hire solutions products have been, and may\ncontinue to be, impacted by the war in Israel. A small portion of our Israel-based employees, and a number of their family members, have been conscripted into military service.\nThe extent of the impact of these factors on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected\ntime frame, will depend on future developments, and the impact on our customers, partners and employees, all of which have uncertainty and cannot be predicted. These global\neconomic conditions and any continued or new disruptions caused by these conditions may negatively impact our business in a number of ways. For example, our Commercial\nEnterprise solutions are sold to businesses whose financial conditions fluctuate based on general economic and business conditions, particularly the overall demand for labor and\nthe economic health of current and prospective employers.\nTo the extent that economic uncertainty or attenuated economic conditions cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their headcount, and reduce\ntheir consumption-based spending, demand for our products and services may be negatively affected. These adverse economic conditions could also result in reductions in sales\nof our applications, longer sales cycles, reductions in contract duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, economic\nrecessions have historically resulted in overall reductions in spending on software and technology solutions as well as pressure from customers and potential customers for\nextended payment terms. If economic, political, or market conditions deteriorate, or if there is uncertainty around these conditions, our customers and potential customers may\nelect to decrease their software and technology solutions budgets by deferring or reconsidering product purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and\nnegatively affect our operating results. Any of these events would likely have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\nDue to the nature of our business, the effect of these macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We have\nassessed the potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and have determined that no additional allowance for credit\nlosses was necessary due to credit deterioration as of September 30, 2024. The most significant risks to our business and results of operations are discussed in Part I, Item 1A\n(Risk Factors) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators\nIn evaluating our cash flows and financial performance, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Pro Forma Software Revenue, non-GAAP gross profit,\nnon-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We also provide certain key performance indicators (“KPIs”), including\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New\nBookings and Gross Revenue Retention.\n“Pro Forma” information provided in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q represents our historical information combined with the historical information of Broadbean\n(as defined below) for the applicable period on a pro forma basis as if we had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. We completed the acquisition of Broadbean on June 13,\n2023, and therefore, periods commencing after June 13, 2023 are not presented on a Pro Forma basis.\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit\ndivided by revenue. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated as our loss from operations with adjustments to add back sales and marketing expense, research and development\nexpense, general and administrative expense and amortization expense. Non-GAAP net loss (pro forma) is the Company’s net loss excluding the items set forth below. Non-\nGAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for\nincome taxes,\n35\ndepreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign\ncurrency gains and losses, gain on debt extinguishment, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain or loss on sale of investment assets, loss from business held for sale, variable\nconsultant performance bonus expense, severance and executive transition costs and net income from discontinued operations. The results for non-GAAP net income (loss), are\npresented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of\nGAAP net loss, non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between our Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliation below. In addition, we\nhave provided supplemental non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating expenses, loss from operations, other (expense) income, net, and loss before income taxes,\nexcluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are\ncommonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management also uses this information internally for\nforecasting and budgeting. These non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to\nnet income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure\nof liquidity. Other companies (including our competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. These non-GAAP measures may not be indicative of our\nhistorical operating results or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider this supplemental non-GAAP financial information in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP

information regarding our Software Products & Services as a lookback of prior years to explain our\nrecent historical and year-over-year performance.\nThe supplemental financial information for our Software Products & Services includes: (i) Pro Forma Software Revenue, (ii) Total Software Products & Services\nCustomers, (iii) Annual Recurring Revenue, (iv) Total New Bookings, and (iv) Gross Revenue Retention, in each case as defined in the footnotes to the table below.\nIn the past, we have provided supplemental financial information for our Managed Services including average billings per active Managed Services client, and revenue.\nBecause Managed Services will comprise a smaller portion of our business after the Divestiture, we no longer will provide this supplemental information. Prior to the\nDivestiture, we experienced volatility in revenue from our Managed Services due to a number of factors, including: (i) the timing of new large customer agreements; (ii) loss of\ncustomers who chose to replace our services with new providers or by bringing their advertising placement in-house; (iii) customers who experience reductions in their\nadvertising budgets due to issues with their own businesses; and (iv) the seasonality of the campaigns for certain large customers. We historically generated a significant portion\nof our revenue from a few major customers. After the Divestiture, we expect revenue from our Managed Services to continue to experience volatility.\nSoftware Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information\nThe following table sets forth the results for each of our Software Products & Services supplemental financial information.\nQuarter Ended\nMar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30,\n2022 (1) 2022 (1) 2022 (1) 2022 (1) 2023 (1) 2023 (1) 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in\n000's) (2) $ 26,319 $ 26,650 $ 28,603 $ 35,612 $ 22,423 $ 20,859 $ 20,361 $ 19,824 $ 15,223 $ 15,632 $ 14,694\nTotal Software Products &\nServices Customers (3) 3,673 3,718 3,787 3,824 3,773 3,705 3,536 3,459 3,384 3,437 3,291\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)\n(in 000's) (4) $ 48,392 $ 44,465 $ 43,925 $ 46,248 $ 45,453 $ 47,720 $ 47,756 $ 49,122 $ 49,064 $ 49,223 $ 48,269\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\n(Consumption) (in 000's) (5) $ 87,445 $ 85,901 $ 85,091 $ 71,754 $ 67,242 $ 60,229 $ 41,543 $ 30,967 $ 23,510 $ 18,701 $ 15,011\nTotal New Bookings (in 000's) (6) $ 16,643 $ 22,009 $ 23,793 $ 26,342 $ 22,794 $ 8,388 $ 15,501 $ 17,457 $ 12,964 $ 14,047 $ 16,471\nGross Revenue Retention (7) >90% >90% >90% >90% >90% >90% >90% >90% >90% >90% >90%\n(1) All of the supplemental financial information for this period is presented on a Pro Forma basis inclusive of Broadbean.\n(2) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis.\n(3) “Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also\nexcludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each\nfiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the Company to be under an active contract for the applicable periods.\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the\nquarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month\nbasis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services customers inclusive of Broadbean.\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers,\nin each case on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by\nthe average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring\nRevenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management\nuses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as\ncompared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n(5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in\neach case, on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by\nthe average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual\nRecurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above\ninstead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly\nincreases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and\nmore volatile Consumption revenues.\n(6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license\nfees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma\nbasis.\n(7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the\n3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no\nlonger customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide\n41\nthe total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software\nProducts & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro\nForma basis.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of revenue to pro forma revenue and the calculation of pro forma annual recurring revenue.\nQuarter Ended\nMar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30,\n2022 2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nSoftware Products & Services\nRevenue (in 000’s) $ 18,167 $ 18,379 $ 20,812 $ 27,220 $ 14,127 $ 14,093 $ 20,361 $ 19,820 $ 15,220 $ 15,632 $ 14,694\nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1) 6,204 6,974 7,639 8,230 8,156 8,374 8,739 8,662 8,517 8,690 8,169\nBroadbean Revenue included in\nSoftware Products & Services\nRevenue (in 000’s) — — — — — (1,716) (8,739) (8,662) (8,517) (8,690) (8,169)\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in\n000’s) $ 24,371 $ 25,353 $ 28,451 $ 35,450 $ 22,283 $ 20,751 $ 20,361 $ 19,820 $ 15,220 $ 15,632 $ 14,694\nManaged Services Revenue (in\n000’s) 16,240 15,856 16,384 16,670 16,136 13,874 14,772 14,377 16,416 15,360 7,299\nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in\n000’s) $ 40,611 $ 41,209 $ 44,835 $ 52,120 $ 38,419 $ 34,625 $ 35,133 $ 34,197 $ 31,636 $ 30,992 $ 21,993\nTrailing Twelve Months Ended\nMar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sept 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30,\n2022 2022 2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nSoftware Products & Services\nRevenue (in 000’s) $ 72,997 $ 85,796 $ 97,581 $ 84,578 $ 80,538 $ 76,252 $ 75,801 $ 68,401 $ 69,494 $ 71,033 $ 65,366\nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1) 29,599 30,006 30,136 29,047 30,999 32,399 33,499 33,931 34,292 34,608 34,038\nBroadbean Revenue included in\nSoftware Products & Services\nRevenue (in 000’s) — — — — — (1,716) (10,455) (19,117) (27,634) (34,608) (34,038)\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in\n000’s) $ 102,596 $ 115,802 $ 127,717 $ 113,625 $ 111,537 $ 106,935 $ 98,845 $ 83,215 $ 76,152 $ 71,033 $ 65,366\nManaged Services Revenue (in\n000’s) 58,419 60,546 63,406 65,150 65,046 63,064 61,452 59,159 59,439 60,925 53,452\nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in\n000’s) $ 161,015 $ 176,348 $ 191,123 $ 178,775 $ 176,583 $ 169,999 $ 160,297 $ 142,374 $ 135,591 $ 131,958 $ 118,818\nPro Forma Total Number of\nCustomers\n3,673 3,718 3,787 3,824 3,773 3,705 3,536 3,459 3,384 3,437 3,291\nPro Forma Annual Recurring\nRevenue (in 000’s) (2) $ 135,837 $ 130,366 $ 129,016 $ 118,002 $ 112,695 $ 107,949 $ 89,299 $ 80,089 $ 72,574 $ 67,924 $ 63,280\n(1) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” includes historical Software Products & Services Revenue from the past eleven (11) fiscal quarters of each of Veritone, Inc. and Broadbean and presents such revenue on a\ncombined pro forma basis treating Broadbean as owned by Veritone, Inc. since January 1, 2022.\n(2) “Pro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue” represents an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last period of the calculated quarter, combined with the trailing twelve month calculation\nfor all non-recurring and/or consumption based revenue for all active customers.\n42\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue\nfor those periods.

Commercial Enterprise Managed Services decreased $0.3 million, or 4.0%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\ncorresponding prior year period primarily due to lower revenue from licensing customers, partially offset by increased revenue from representation services. Commercial\nEnterprise Managed Services increased $0.4 million, or 1.5%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to\nlower revenue from licensing customers, partially offset by increased revenue from representation services.\nPublic Sector\nPublic Sector Software Products & Services revenue increased $0.1 million, or 8.1%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding\nprior year period and decreased $0.2 million, or 5.3%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to\nfluctuations in timing and magnitude of spend by public safety and federal customers. In some cases, Software Products & Services revenue from Public Sector customers in\ncertain markets, particularly our government customers, can be project-based and impacted by the timing of such projects. As such, we expect that our revenue from these\nmarkets could fluctuate significantly from period to period\nOperating Expenses\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nCost of revenue $ 6,325 $ 7,026 $ (701) (10.0)% $ 19,614 $ 21,381 $ (1,767) (8.3)%\nSales and marketing 10,186 10,997 (811) (7.4)% 31,230 32,895 (1,665) (5.1)%\nResearch and development 7,528 10,410 (2,882) (27.7)% 23,388 32,456 (9,068) (27.9)%\nGeneral and administrative 14,421 18,264 (3,843) (21.0)% 45,133 48,837 (3,704) (7.6)%\nAmortization 6,025 6,454 (429) (6.6)% 18,006 17,087 919 5.4%\nTotal operating expenses $ 44,485 $ 53,151 $ (8,666) (16.3)% $ 137,371 $ 152,656 $ (15,285) (10.0)%\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased by $0.7 million and $1.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the\ncorresponding prior year periods, in each case, primarily due to the decline in revenues, especially in the higher margin Software Products & Services. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, Software Products & Services products accounted for 64.9% of revenues compared to 66.7% in the prior year period. Cost of revenues as a\npercentage of revenue increased to 28.8% from 25.1%\n44\nin the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared a decrease to 27.9% from 29.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.8 million and $1.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the corresponding prior year periods, in each case, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives announced in the first quarter of 2024 partially offset by increased\nadvertising expense and sales and marketing expense as a result of the acquisition of Broadbean in June 2023. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses\nincreased to 46.3% from 39.3% during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased to 44.6% from 45.2% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by $2.9 million, or 27.7%, and $9.1 million, or 27.9%, in the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods, in each case, principally due to decreased personnel-related costs resulting from various\ncost reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased amortization expenses from increased capitalized costs for internal use software and the acquisition of Broadbean in June\n2023. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 34.2% and 33.3% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, from 37.2% and 44.6% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.8 million, or 21.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with\nthe corresponding prior year period, principally due to reductions in non-recurring professional fees largely associated with the Broadbean acquisition and personnel-related\ncosts resulting from various cost reduction initiatives. General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.7 million, or 7.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared with the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the decrease described above, partially offset by a net increase in the first half of 2024 compared to the\nprior year period driven by increased costs from the June 2023 Broadbean acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior period primarily due to\ncertain intangible assets being fully amortized in the third quarter of 2023, and increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior\nyear period primarily due to the addition of amortization expense related to our June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense, net of $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to interest expense, net of $3.0 million, driven by increased interest\nexpense from our Term Loan, partially offset by a foreign translation gain of $0.4 million. Other expense, net of $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023\nwas comprised primarily of a foreign exchange loss of $2.3 million. Other expense, net of $8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to\ninterest expense, net of $8.5 million, driven by increased interest expense from our Term Loan. Other income, net of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwas comprised primarily of a gain on the sale of the energy group of $2.6 million and a foreign exchange gain of $0.5 million, offset by interest expense, net of $2.1 million.\nNet income from discontinued operations\nOn October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture. The Divestiture was strategic, allowing us to focus on our AI solutions, and secondarily to improve our\nfinancial liquidity with the net proceeds from the Divestiture. During the third quarter of 2024, we determined that Veritone One met the criteria to be classified as discontinued\noperations. As a result, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements herein as discontinued operations and, as\nsuch, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. See Note 3 on Discontinued Operations for\nmore information.\nNet income from discontinued operations was $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of (i) revenue of $8.6 million, offset\nby cost of revenue of $0.3 million, other operating expenses of $5.8 million and $1.7 million of net interest expense allocations primarily due to the repayment of our Term\nLoan as a result of the Divestiture. Net income from discontinued operations was $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of (i)\nrevenue of $23.0 million, offset by cost of revenue of $0.7 million, other operating expenses of $14.7 million and $4.7 million of net interest expense allocations primarily due\nto the repayment of our Term Loan as a result of the Divestiture.\n45\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\nOur non-GAAP gross profit is calculated as our revenue less our cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The decline in non-GAAP gross\nmargin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to the decline in higher margin Commercial\nEnterprise revenue, including one-time software revenue and consumption based revenue from customers such as Amazon.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nWe have historically financed our business through the sale of equity and debt securities. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, which\ntotaled $11.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with total cash and cash equivalents of $46.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in our cash and cash\nequivalents as of September 30, 2024 as compared with December 31, 2023 was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of $24.2 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had cash from discontinued operations of $34.5 million and $32.8 million,\nrespectively.\nIn December 2023, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the\nCompany and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC and with certain other lenders (collectively, the\n“Lenders”) and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $77.5 million senior secured term\nloan (the “Term Loan”), which was fully drawn by us on closing of the Term Loan.\nOn October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture for a total purchase price of up to $104.0 million. Net proceeds from the transaction were $59.1 million in cash,\nwhich reflected the aggregate purchase price of $104.0 million, less $18.0 million subject to the Earnout described below, $20.3 million of purchase price adjustments, and $6.7\nmillion placed in escrow accounts. We may receive the Earnout of up to $18.0 million in cash proceeds based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets by the\nDivestiture between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. On October 22, 2024, we used net cash proceeds from the Divestiture to repay $30.5 million principal amount of\nthe Term Loan, plus accrued interest and prepayment premiums in the aggregate amount of $3.3 million. As of October 22, 2024, immediately following the Divestiture and the\nrepayment of a portion of our Term Loan, we reported cash on hand of $27.3 million\nBased on our liquidity position at September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the impact of the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our Term Loan, and our\ncurrent forecast of operating results and cash flows, absent any other action, management determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern over the twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, principally driven by our current debt service obligations, historical negative cash\nflows and recurring losses. We will require additional liquidity to continue our operations over the next twelve months.\nIn the near term, and to meet our obligations as they come due, management is evaluating strategies to obtain funding for future operations. These strategies may\ninclude, but are not limited to, obtaining equity financing, debt and/or further restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease operating expenses, which include\ncapturing past cost reductions and potential future cost synergies from our past acquisitions.\n46\nThe going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, including the ability to meet\nminimum liquidity thresholds under our Term Loan Credit Agreement. We may not be able to access additional equity under acceptable terms, and may not be successful in\nfuture operational restructurings, earning any of our deferred purchase consideration, meeting our minimum liquidity threshold under our Credit Agreement, growing our\nrevenue base and our ability to execute on our operating plans may be materially adversely impacted. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to\ndispose of other or additional assets and might realize significantly less value than the values at which they are carried on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThese actions may cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might result from our being unable to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and\nclassification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.\nCash Flows\nA summary of cash flows from our operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the table below.\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash used in operating activities $ (24,223) $ (48,111)\nCash used in investing activities (3,334) (53,745)\nCash used in financing activities (5,895) (10,487)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (33,452) $ (112,343)\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities used cash of $24.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to our net loss of $69.2 million, adjusted by $28.1\nmillion in non-cash expenses, including $21.7 million in depreciation and amortization, $5.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and $4.6 million of amortized debt\nissuance costs, partially offset by $5.0 million from deferred taxes.

The total net cash\nprovided by operating activities from discontinued operations was $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily relates to net income from\ndiscontinued operations of $2.9 million and the impact from net working capital of $19.9 million, partially offset by net transfers from the Company of $21.4 million. Net cash\nused in operating activities from discontinued operations was $28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily relates to net transfers from the\n47\nCompany of $21.2 million and net income from discontinued operations of $5.3 million, partially offset by the impact from net working capital of $13.9 million. Net cash used\nin investing activities was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nAs of September 30, 2024, our debt obligations are comprised of our Term Loan and our 1.75% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the “Convertible Notes”). As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we have $75.6 million principal amount outstanding under our Term Loan that matures in December 2027 and $91.2 million aggregate principal amount\noutstanding of our Convertible Notes that mature in November 2026. On October 22, 2024, we repaid $30.5 million principal amount of our Term Loan and, after such\nrepayment, $43.1 million principal amount remained outstanding under our Term Loan.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have no other present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of businesses or technologies or any other\nmaterial capital expenditures.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have recorded $2.0 million of gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. Based upon the information\navailable and possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period in which the liability might be paid.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases its\nestimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nOur critical accounting estimates reflecting management’s estimates and judgments are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023. We have reviewed recently adopted accounting pronouncements and determined that the adoption of such pronouncements is not expected to have a material impact, if\nany, on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, there have been no material changes to critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n48\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide\nreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to enable timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Our management\nrecognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and\nthere is no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will operate effectively under all circumstances. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the\nfollowing material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness in internal control over\nfinancial reporting as the Company did not have an effective information and communication process that identified and assessed the source of and controls necessary to ensure\nthe reliability of information used in financial reporting and for providing information required for effective activity level controls. This material weakness could have resulted\nin a material misstatement to the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the preparation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in\ninternal control over financial reporting:\n•Management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to the consolidation process and review of financial statements\nspecifically pertaining to the Company’s design of controls to determine proper accounting for certain foreign exchange transactions and translation between Veritone,\nInc. and certain foreign subsidiaries. This material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements. However, this material\nweakness could have resulted in a material misstatement to the Company’s annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or\ndetected and corrected on a timely basis.\n•Management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) in the areas of user\naccess and change-management over certain information technology (“IT”) systems that support our financial reporting processes. The Company’s business process\nautomated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. These control\ndeficiencies were a result of user access and change management processes over certain IT systems.\nRelated to these findings, management concluded that during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not maintain appropriately designed entity-level\ncontrols impacting the control environment or monitoring controls to prevent or detect material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, these\ndeficiencies were attributed to (i) a lack of a sufficient number of qualified resources to perform control activities and (ii) insufficient risk assessment and monitoring activities\nas a result of untimely or ineffective identification of internal control risks to properly design, test, implement and assess effective internal controls over financial reporting.\n49\nRemediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn order to remediate the material weaknesses, management has taken remediation actions including:\n(i)engagement of an outside firm to assist with the remediation actions in March 2024;\n(ii)implemented a more robust plan and risk assessment around the proper design, testing and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting in April\n2024;\n(iii)implemented a training program addressing ITGCs and policies, including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each\ncontrol, with a focus on those related to user access and change management over IT systems impacting financial reporting;\n(iv)implemented documentation of underlying ITGCs to promote knowledge transfer upon personnel and function changes;\n(v)implemented an IT management review and testing plan to monitor ITGCs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes;\nand\n(vi)trained staff on proper accounting for foreign exchange translation, transactions when consolidating foreign subsidiaries and the proper, accurate and\ntimely evaluation of the realizability of long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets. Management has also hired additional staff to oversee the\nimplementation and testing of these remediation actions.\nTo further remediate the existing material weakness identified herein, the management team, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have\nreaffirmed and re-emphasized the importance of internal controls, control consciousness and a strong control environment. We are committed to maintaining a strong control\nenvironment and believe that these remediation efforts represent continued improvement in our control environment.\nWe also expect to continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. While remediating actions have been implemented to\nmitigate the material weaknesses identified with regards to foreign transaction consolidation and ITGCs, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the\napplicable remediated and enhanced control processes have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that this enhanced control is\noperating effectively.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWhile management continues to make progress on its remediation efforts, there were no definitive changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term\nis defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nManagement recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in\nevaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision\nmaking can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,\nby collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the\nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n50\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We currently are not a party to any\nlegal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management’s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\nfinancial position or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation could have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management\nresources and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as supplemented by our Quarterly Report on From 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024,\ncontains a discussion of the material risks associated with our business. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risks described in such Annual\nReport on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe recently sold Veritone One, our full-service advertising agency, which represented approximately 25% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs a result, our revenue following the sale of Veritone One will be reduced and our business will be less diversified.\nOn October 17, 2024, we sold our full-service advertising agency and wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritone One, LLC, to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P.\nApproximately 25% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated from Veritone One. As a result of the Divestiture, our business is focused on\nenterprise AI and the type of risks associated with such business. Further, immediately following the Divestiture, our business will generate less revenue which may exacerbate\nrisks related to our operations, including our ability to service our outstanding debt and finance our operations. If these difficulties or challenges cannot be overcome, our\nbusiness may not be successful and the impact of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern depends on, among other factors, our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic\nand competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nBased on our liquidity position at September 30, 2024 and our current forecast of operating results and cash flows, absent any other action, management determined that\nthere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, principally driven\nby our current debt service obligations, historical negative cash flows and recurring losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to service our\ndebt obligations under the Term Loan as they become due, which, in turn, is dependent on, among other factors, our financial condition and operating performance, which are\nsubject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our determination that we may be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern may materially harm our business and reputation and may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations,\nincluding through equity financings, incurring additional debt or otherwise, which in turn, may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the near term, to meet our cash obligations as they come due, we are evaluating strategies to obtain funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but\nare not limited to, obtaining equity financing, debt and/or further restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease operating expenses, which include capturing past\ncost reduction and potential future cost synergies from our past acquisitions. In addition, on October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture for a total purchase price of up\nto $104.0 million. Net proceeds from the transaction were $59.1 million in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of $104.0 million, less $18.0 million subject to an\nearnout described below, $20.3 million of purchase price adjustments, and $6.7 million placed in escrow accounts. On October 22, 2024, we used net cash proceeds from the\nDivestiture to repay $30.5 million principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan, plus accrued interest and a prepayment premium in the aggregate amount of $3.3 million. As\nof October 22, 2024, immediately following the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our Term Loan, we reported cash on hand of $27.3 million.\nThe going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We may not be able to access\nadditional equity under acceptable terms, and may not be successful in future operational restructurings or at growing our revenue base. If we are unable to capture past cost\nreduction and potential future cost synergies from our past acquisitions, we would likely not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity to service our current debt\nobligations, and our ability to execute on our operating plans may be materially adversely impacted. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to\ndispose of other or additional assets and might realize significantly less value than the values at which they are carried on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThese actions may cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values\nand classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.\n51\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 0 and 298,110 shares of our common stock (“Common Stock”) to certain Warrant Holders\nupon the exercise of 0 and 499,857 warrants held by them, respectively. Each warrant was cashless exercised at a strike price of $2.5760. The shares of Common Stock issued\nupon exercise of these warrants were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. Each of the Warrant Holders\nrepresented that they were acquiring the warrants and, upon any exercise thereof, will acquire shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, for such Warrant Holder’s\nown account and not with a view to distribution or resale in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law.\nItem 3.

Trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nForward-Looking Statements & Disclaimers\nThis presentation of Veritone, Inc. (the “Company”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “continue,” “can,” “may,” “confident”, “outlook”, “plans,” “potential,” “projects,”\n“seeks,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those expressions may identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\nWe may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events\ncould differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation reflect our current views with\nrespect to future events, our business outlook for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and expectations for our business after the sale of Veritone One LLC.\nForward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this presentation. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\n30, 2024, and other periodic reports that we have filed and may in the future file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), particularly in the Risk Factors sections, that we believe could cause\nactual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Those factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited\ngrowth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our\noperations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key\ncustomers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or\nongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\nfluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our\nexisting products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third\nparty technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or\nsecurity issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the\nRussia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of\nrecession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-\nlooking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nBefore you invest, you should read our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the other documents we have filed and may in the future file\nwith the SEC for more complete information about the Company. You may obtain these documents for free on our website or by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\nThe historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in this earnings release as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a\nretrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout the presentation relate to the Company’s continuing operations.\nIn addition to our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables\ndetailing the items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Appendix.\nWe have provided these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts,\ninvestors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash\nflow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including our competitors) may define these non-GAAP measures differently.These non-GAAP measures may not be indicative of our\nhistorical operating results or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nThis presentation also contains information using industry publications that generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but such information may\nnot be accurate or complete. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the information from these industry publications, we have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources\nnor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied on therein.\n2\nCopyright © 2024 Veritone, Inc.

In order to provide enhanced\nvisibility into our growth composition and broad customer base, we have added ARR as a key metric and defined our customer count methodology.\nDEFINITIONS\n“Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as\ntrial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone,\nInc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services\nCustomers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts.\nManagement uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive\nof Broadbean.\n“Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers,\ncombined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve-month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average\nAnnual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring\nRevenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue is on a Pro Forma basis where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual\nrevenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or\nconsumption-based revenues.\n“Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case on a Pro Forma basis. In prior\nperiods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and\nPandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of\nrecurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of\nsubscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n“Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, on a Pro Forma basis. In prior\nperiods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and\nPandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers\nand uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean\nsignificantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption\nrevenues.\n“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term),\nexcluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services).\n“Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such\nperiod, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software\nCustomer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products &\nServices Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis.\n“Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis.\n“Non-GAAP Gross Profit” is defined as revenue less cost of revenue.\n“Non-GAAP Gross Margin” is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue.\n29\nCopyright © 2024 Veritone, Inc.
