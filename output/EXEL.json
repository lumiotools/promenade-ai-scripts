The sNDA is based on the final results of the phase 3 CABINET pivotal trial, conducted by the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trials Network, evaluating cabozantinib compared with placebo in advanced pNET and advanced epNET. In August 2024, Exelixis [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-announces-us-food-and-drug-administration-fda-accepted&esheet=54158650&newsitemid=20241126525837&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=2&md5=ddd0d8302aa4c0ce5e0dc26c9bf29677) that the FDA granted orphan drug designation to cabozantinib for the treatment of pNET and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of April 3, 2025. \n\nAs [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-announces-positive-results-phase-3-cabinet-pivotal&esheet=54158650&newsitemid=20241126525837&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=3&md5=3d51f63a97c52ee92a9ef1c82108d033) in August 2023, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board unanimously recommended that enrollment in the CABINET trial be stopped and randomized patients be unblinded to therapy with the allowance for crossover from placebo to cabozantinib due to the substantial improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) observed at this interim analysis. Final results from the enrolled patient population, which were [presented](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.exelixis.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fexelixis-announces-final-results-phase-3-pivotal-cabinet-study&esheet=54158650&newsitemid=20241126525837&lan=en-US&anchor=presented&index=4&md5=50ee47478e4f716d3eb3388e2ffa4fde) at the 2024 European Society of Medical Oncology Congress and published concurrently in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ , confirmed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements with cabozantinib versus placebo in the primary endpoint of PFS by blinded independent central review. Additional analyses supported consistency of benefit across all clinical subgroups examined, including primary tumor site, grade and prior systemic anticancer therapy. \n\nODACs review and evaluate data regarding the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drug products for use in the treatment of cancer and make recommendations to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. More general information about ODAC reviews can be found on the FDA website, [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fadvisory-committees%2Fhuman-drug-advisory-committees%2Foncologic-drugs-advisory-committee&esheet=54158650&newsitemid=20241126525837&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=5&md5=5f87e8029f1f400690b51f2e5283d5a5). The planned ODAC meeting is not related to the current approved indications for CABOMETYX in the U.S.\n\n**About CABINET (Alliance A021602)**\n\nCABINET (Randomized, Double-Blinded Phase III Study of **CAB** ozantinib versus Placebo **I** n Patients with Advanced **NE** uroendocrine **T** umors After Progression on Prior Therapy) is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and is being led and conducted by the NCI-funded Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology with participation from the NCI-funded National Clinical Trials Network as part of Exelixis’ collaboration through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. \n\nCABINET is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal trial that had enrolled a total of 298 patients in the U.S at the time of the final analysis. Patients were randomized 2:1 to cabozantinib (60 mg) or placebo in two separately powered cohorts (pNET, n=95; epNET, n=203). The epNET cohort included patients with the following primary tumor sites: gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lung, unknown primary sites and other. Each cohort was randomized separately and had its own statistical analysis plan. Patients must have had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and must have experienced disease progression or intolerance after at least one U.S. FDA-approved line of prior therapy other than somatostatin analogs. The primary endpoint in each cohort was PFS per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, radiographic response rate and safety. More information about this trial is available at [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT03375320&esheet=54158650&newsitemid=20241126525837&lan=en-US&anchor=ClinicalTrials.gov&index=6&md5=ca3ffc25b04d53c7aa84e014d3ca0560). \n\n**About Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET)**\n\nNET are cancers that begin in the specialized cells of the body’s neuroendocrine system.1 These cells have traits of both hormone-producing endocrine cells and nerve cells.1 In the U.S., it is estimated that 161,000 to 192,000 people are living with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NET.2 The number of people diagnosed with NET has been increasing in recent decades.3 Functional NET release peptide hormones that can cause debilitating symptoms, like diarrhea, hypertension and flushing which may require focused treatment, while symptoms of non-functional NET are related primarily to tumor growth.4,5 Most NET take years to develop and grow slowly, but eventually all patients with advanced or metastatic NET will develop refractory and progressing disease.6,7\n\nNET can develop in any part of the body, but most commonly start in the GI tract or in the lungs, where they have historically been referred to as carcinoid tumors and are more recently called epNET.1 The five-year survival rates for advanced GI and lung NET tumors are 68% and 55%, respectively.8,9 NET can also start in the pancreas, where they tend to be more aggressive, with a five-year survival rate of only 23% for advanced disease. 1,10 For advanced NET patients, treatment options include somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy.11\n\n**About CABOMETYX** ®**(cabozantinib)**\n\nIn the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in combination with nivolumab for patients as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced RCC; for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib, and; for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in over 65 countries outside the U.S. and Japan, including the European Union. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen Pharma SAS exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the U.S.\n\nCABOMETYX is not indicated as a treatment for NET. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Hemorrhage:** Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC, HCC, and DTC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage and prior to surgery as recommended. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena. \n\n**Perforations and Fistulas:** Fistulas, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. GI perforations, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation. \n\n**Thrombotic Events:** CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention. \n\n**Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis:** CABOMETYX can cause hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 37% (16% Grade 3 and <1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis. \n\n**Diarrhea:** Diarrhea occurred in 62% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor and manage patients using antidiarrheals as indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to ≤ Grade 1, resume at a reduced dose. \n\n**Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE):** PPE occurred in 45% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE. \n\n**Hepatotoxicity:** CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone. \n\nMonitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids. \n\nWith the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST >3 times ULN (Grade ≥2) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24), recurrence of Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX, 2 patients receiving nivolumab, and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose based on severity. \n\n**Adrenal Insufficiency:** CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab and resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose depending on severity. \n\nAdrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab, including Grade 3 (2.2%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC. \n\nApproximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. \n\n**Proteinuria:** Proteinuria was observed in 8% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. For Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria, withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to ≤ Grade 1 proteinuria; resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. \n\n**Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ):** ONJ occurred in <1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain, or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Withhold CABOMETYX for development of ONJ until complete resolution, resume at a reduced dose. \n\n**Impaired Wound Healing:** Wound complications occurred with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CABOMETYX for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of CABOMETYX after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. \n\n**Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):** RPLS, a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI, can occur with CABOMETYX. Evaluate for RPLS in patients presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion, or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS. \n\n**Thyroid Dysfunction:** Thyroid dysfunction, primarily hypothyroidism, has been observed with CABOMETYX. Based on the safety population, thyroid dysfunction occurred in 19% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 0.4% of patients. \n\nPatients should be assessed for signs of thyroid dysfunction prior to the initiation of CABOMETYX and monitored for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during CABOMETYX treatment. Thyroid function testing and management of dysfunction should be performed as clinically indicated. \n\n**Hypocalcemia:** CABOMETYX can cause hypocalcemia. Based on the safety population, hypocalcemia occurred in 13% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 2% and Grade 4 in 1% of patients. Laboratory abnormality data were not collected in CABOSUN. \n\nIn COSMIC-311, hypocalcemia occurred in 36% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 6% and Grade 4 in 3% of patients. \n\nMonitor blood calcium levels and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue CABOMETYX depending on severity. \n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:** CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose. \n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions are: \n\nCABOMETYX as a single agent: diarrhea, fatigue, PPE, decreased appetite, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, weight decreased, and constipation. \n\nCABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab: diarrhea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, PPE, stomatitis, rash, hypertension, hypothyroidism, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, dysgeusia, abdominal pain, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection. \n\n**DRUG INTERACTIONS**\n\n**Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the CABOMETYX dosage. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice. \n\n**Strong CYP3A4 Inducers:** If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, increase the CABOMETYX dosage. Avoid St. John’s wort. \n\n**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n**Lactation:** Advise women not to breastfeed during CABOMETYX treatment and for 4 months after the final dose. \n\n**Hepatic Impairment:** In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reduce the CABOMETYX dosage.

(Nasdaq: EXEL) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024, provided an update on progress toward achieving key corporate objectives, and detailed its recent and anticipated commercial, clinical and pipeline development milestones. \n\n“The favorable ruling on our cabozantinib intellectual property estate and recently announced zanzalintinib development collaboration with Merck have generated important momentum to drive future growth across all components of our business,” said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., President and CEO, Exelixis. “We are increasing 2024 full year guidance for total and net product U.S. revenues based on the strong commercial performance of the cabozantinib franchise in the third quarter. We continue to execute on our plans for potential cabozantinib label expansions in neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, with the final results from CABINET published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ in September and our partner Ipsen’s regulatory submission in Europe.” \n\nDr. Morrissey continued: “Importantly, the zanzalintinib development program, which is now the subject of six ongoing or planned phase 3 pivotal trials, including two new renal cell carcinoma studies as part of our collaboration with Merck, headlines our emerging pipeline of novel agents with the potential to improve standards of care for patients with cancer. At the same time, we are accelerating our early-stage clinical pipeline with XL309, XB010 and XL495 in phase 1 development. I want to thank everyone at Exelixis for their hard work and dedication as we continue driving value for shareholders and innovating on behalf of the patients we serve.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total revenues** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024were $539.5 million, as compared to $471.9 million for the comparable period in 2023. \n\nTotal revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 included net product revenues of $478.1 million, as compared to $426.5 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in net product revenues was primarily due to an increase in sales volume and average net selling price. \n\nCollaboration revenues, composed of license revenues and collaboration services revenues, were $61.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $45.4 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in collaboration revenues was primarily related to an increase in milestone-related revenues recognized in the quarter and higher royalty revenues for the sales of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. generated by Exelixis’ collaboration partners, Ipsen Pharma SAS (Ipsen) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, partially offset by a decrease in development cost reimbursements earned. \n\n**Research and development expenses** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $222.6 million, as compared to $332.6 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily related to decreases in license and other collaboration costs. \n\n**Selling, general and administrative expenses** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $111.8 million, as compared to $138.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to decreases in corporate giving, stock-based compensation expenses and legal and advisory fees. \n\n**Impairment of long-lived assets** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of $51.7 million was related to the non-cash asset impairment charge to certain of Exelixis’ leased facilities which are currently not in use and may be subleased. \n\n**Provision for income taxes** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $36.8 million, as compared to $4.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. \n\n**GAAP net income** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $118.0 million, or $0.41 per share, basic and $0.40 per share, diluted, as compared to GAAP net income of $1.0 million, or $0.00 per share, basic and diluted, for the comparable period in 2023. GAAP net income per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by lower weighted-average common shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable period in 2023, as a result of the stock repurchase programs. \n\n**Non-GAAP net income** for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $135.7 million, or $0.47 per share, basic and diluted, as compared to non-GAAP net income of $32.1 million, or $0.10 per share, basic and diluted, for the comparable period in 2023. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement Exelixis’ financial results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Exelixis presents non-GAAP net income (and the related per share measures), which excludes from GAAP net income (and the related per share measures) stock-based compensation expense, adjusted for the related income tax effect for all periods presented. \n\nExelixis believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. In particular, Exelixis believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with its financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors’ and analysts’ ability to meaningfully compare Exelixis’ results from period to period, and to identify operating trends in Exelixis’ business. Exelixis has excluded stock-based compensation expense, adjusted for the related income tax effect, because it is a non-cash item that may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the operational performance for the periods presented. Exelixis also regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Exelixis encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP financial information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand Exelixis’ business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nExelixis is providing the following updated financial guidance for fiscal year 2024(1): \n\n**Current Guidance**(provided on October 29, 2024)  |  **Previous Guidance**(provided on August 6, 2024)   \n---|---  \nTotal revenues  |  $2.150 billion - $2.200 billion |  $1.975 billion - $2.075 billion  \nNet product revenues(2) |  $1.775 billion - $1.825 billion |  $1.650 billion - $1.750 billion  \nCost of goods sold  |  ~4.5% of net product revenues  |  4% - 5% of net product revenues   \nResearch and development expenses  |  $925 million - $950 million(3) |  $925 million - $975 million(4)  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses(5) |  $475 million - $500 million |  $450 million - $500 million  \nEffective tax rate  |  21% - 22%  |  20% - 22%   \n  \n____________________   \n---  \n(1) |  2024 financial guidance excludes expenses related to the restructuring plan announced in January 2024 and impairment of long-lived assets announced in October 2024.   \n(2) |  Exelixis’ 2024 net product revenues guidance range includes the impact of a U.S. wholesale acquisition cost increase of 2.2% for both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ effective on January 1, 2024.   \n(3) |  Includes $30 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.   \n(4) |  Includes $40 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.   \n(5) |  Includes $60 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.   \n  \n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n**Favorable Ruling in Second Cabozantinib Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Litigation Against MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MSN). **In October, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the District Court) ruled in Exelixis’ favor, rejecting MSN’s challenge to three Orange Book-listed patents related to cabozantinib (U.S. Patents No. 11,091,439 (crystalline salt forms), 11,091,440 (pharmaceutical composition) and 11,098,015 (methods of treatment)), which expire January 15, 2030. The District Court’s decision follows an earlier stipulation that MSN’s proposed generic cabozantinib product (ANDA No. 213878) infringes the ’439, ’440, and ’015 patents. The District Court also ruled that Exelixis’ U.S. Patent No. 11,298,349 (pharmaceutical composition) is not invalid and not infringed by MSN’s proposed ANDA product. To Exelixis’ knowledge, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet granted tentative approval of MSN’s proposed ANDA product. On October 23, 2024, the District Court entered final judgment reflecting the opinion. Based on the District Court’s final judgment, should the FDA ultimately approve MSN’s ANDA, the effective date of any such approval and commercial launch in the U.S. of MSN’s proposed ANDA product shall not be a date earlier than January 15, 2030, subject to Exelixis’ potential additional regulatory exclusivity. The District Court’s judgment is also subject to appeal by either party. \n\n**New Clinical Development Collaboration with Merck to Evaluate Zanzalintinib in Combination with KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) in Head and Neck Cancer and with WELIREG® (belzutifan) in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC).** In October, Exelixis and Merck (known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada) announced a clinical development collaboration to evaluate zanzalintinib in combination with KEYTRUDA in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and zanzalintinib with WELIREG in RCC. Under the terms of the collaboration, Merck will supply KEYTRUDA, its anti-PD-1 therapy, for the ongoing, Exelixis-sponsored phase 3 STELLAR-305 pivotal trial in previously untreated PD-L1 positive recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. In addition, Merck will sponsor a phase 1/2 trial and two phase 3 pivotal trials evaluating zanzalintinib in combination with WELIREG, its oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor, in RCC. Merck will fund one of these phase 3 studies, and Exelixis will co-fund the phase 1/2 trial and the other phase 3 study, as well as supply zanzalintinib and cabozantinib. Exelixis maintains all global commercial and marketing rights to zanzalintinib. \n\n**Stock Repurchase Program.** In August, Exelixis announced that the company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company’s common stock through the end of 2025, the third stock repurchase program undertaken by Exelixis since March 2023. Under this program, as of September 30, 2024, Exelixis has repurchased $12.4 million of the company’s common stock, at an average price of $25.61 per share. \n\n**Cabozantinib Highlights**\n\n**Cabozantinib Franchise Net Product Revenues and Royalties.** Net product revenues generated by the cabozantinib franchise in the U.S. were $478.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, with net product revenues of $475.7 million from CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib) and $2.4 million from COMETRIQ® (cabozantinib). Based upon cabozantinib-related net product revenues generated by Exelixis’ collaboration partners during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Exelixis earned $41.8 million in royalty revenues. \n\n**Exelixis’ Partner Ipsen Opted into Phase 3 CABINET Pivotal Trial in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) and Submitted an Extension of Indication Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).** In July, Ipsen announced it opted into the phase 3 CABINET pivotal trial, expanding the existing collaboration and license agreement with Exelixis and permitting Ipsen to seek potential marketing authorizations for CABOMETYX in advanced pancreatic NET (pNET) and extra-pancreatic NET (epNET) from regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. and Japan. As part of the agreement, Exelixis is eligible to receive reimbursement of a portion of costs related to the trial, as well as milestone payments for potential future regulatory action by the EMA. In September, Ipsen announced it submitted an extension of indication Marketing Authorization to the EMA for CABOMETYX in advanced NET. These announcements were based on detailed results from CABINET, which evaluated cabozantinib compared with placebo in patients with previously treated advanced pNET and advanced epNET. CABINET is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and led by the NCI-funded Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology. \n\n**FDA Accepted Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Cabozantinib for Patients with Advanced NET.** In August, Exelixis announced that the FDA accepted its sNDA for cabozantinib for patients with previously treated advanced pNET and for patients with previously treated advanced epNET. The FDA assigned a standard review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of April 3, 2025. The FDA also granted orphan drug designation to cabozantinib for the treatment of pNET. The sNDA was based on results from the CABINET trial. \n\n**Final Results from Phase 3 CABINET Pivotal Trial Evaluating Cabozantinib in Advanced NET Presented at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and Published in _The_  _New England Journal of Medicine_ (_NEJM_). **In September, detailed final results from CABINET were presented at the 2024 ESMO Congress and published in _NEJM_. The results demonstrated continued improvement with cabozantinib in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review, and additional analyses suggest benefits with cabozantinib across all clinical subgroups examined, including primary tumor site, grade and prior systemic anti-cancer therapy. \n\n**Final Overall Survival (OS) Results from Phase 3 CONTACT-02 Pivotal Trial Evaluating Cabozantinib in Combination with Atezolizumab in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Presented at the 2024 ESMO Congress. **In September, the final analysis of OS from the phase 3 CONTACT-02 pivotal study was presented at the 2024 ESMO Congress. The results of the final OS analysis showed a trend that favored the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab but was not statistically significant. The trend in OS benefit was consistently observed in key subgroups, including in patients with liver metastases, a subgroup of mCRPC patients with the poorest prognosis in need of new treatment options, which Exelixis anticipates will grow in the coming years. CONTACT-02 evaluated cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab compared with a second novel hormonal therapy (NHT) in patients with measurable, extra-pelvic mCRPC who have progressed after treatment with one prior NHT. Exelixis intends to submit an sNDA to the FDA for cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab for mCRPC in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n**Pipeline Highlights**\n\n**Enrollment Completion for Zanzalintinib Phase 3 STELLAR-303 Study in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC) and Announcement of STELLAR-311 Pivotal Trial Evaluating Zanzalintinib in NET.** In August, Exelixis announced that enrollment was completed in the STELLAR-303 phase 3 pivotal study. STELLAR-303 is evaluating zanzalintinib in combination with atezolizumab compared with regorafenib in patients with metastatic refractory CRC that is not microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient. The primary endpoint in the study is OS in the patients without liver metastases. Exelixis anticipates preliminary results from the study in 2025. Additionally, Exelixis announced plans to initiate STELLAR-311, a new phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating zanzalintinib compared with everolimus as a first oral therapy in patients with advanced NET, regardless of site of origin, in the first half of 2025. \n\n**Initiation of Phase 1 Clinical Trial Evaluating XB010 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.** In August, Exelixis announced the initiation of the dose-escalation stage of the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of XB010 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. XB010, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a monomethyl auristatin E payload conjugated to a monoclonal antibody targeting the tumor antigen 5T4, is the first custom ADC generated through Exelixis’ biotherapeutics collaboration network. The dose-escalation stage of this global phase 1 study is evaluating XB010 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab to inform the cohort-expansion stage. The expansion cohorts are designed to further assess the tolerability and activity of monotherapy and of the combination in specific indications. \n\n**Initiation of Phase 1 Clinical Trial Evaluating XL495 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.** Today, Exelixis announced the initiation of the dose-escalation stage of the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of XL495 in patients with advanced solid tumors. XL495 is a novel, potent, small molecule inhibitor of PKMYT1. The dose-escalation stage of this phase 1 study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of XL495. The expansion cohorts are designed to further assess the tolerability and activity of XL495 both as monotherapy and in combination with select cytotoxic agents in tumor-specific indications. \n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nExelixis has adopted a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that generally ends on the Friday closest to December 31. For convenience, references in this press release as of and for the fiscal periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, are indicated as being as of and for the periods endedSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023**.**\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nExelixis management will discuss the company’s financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and provide a general business update during a conference call beginning at 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT today, Tuesday, October 29, 2024. \n\nTo access the conference call, please register using this [link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBIca35e05cd34e4566ba5d462ad6a2442c&esheet=54143333&newsitemid=20241029473805&lan=en-US&anchor=link&index=1&md5=8606fbe61585827520108cdf06e36784).

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation: the degree of market acceptance of CABOMETYX and other Exelixis products in the indications for which they are approved and in the territories where they are approved, and Exelixis’ and its partners’ ability to obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for these products; the effectiveness of CABOMETYX and other Exelixis products in comparison to competing products; the level of costs associated with Exelixis’ commercialization, research and development, in-licensing or acquisition of product candidates, and other activities; Exelixis’ ability to maintain and scale adequate sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities for its products or to enter into and maintain agreements with third parties to do so; the availability of data at the referenced times; the potential failure of cabozantinib, zanzalintinib and other Exelixis product candidates, both alone and in combination with other therapies, to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy in clinical testing; uncertainties inherent in the drug discovery and product development process; Exelixis’ dependence on its relationships with its collaboration partners, including their pursuit of regulatory approvals for partnered compounds in new indications, their adherence to their obligations under relevant collaboration agreements and the level of their investment in the resources necessary to complete clinical trials or successfully commercialize partnered compounds in the territories where they are approved; complexities and the unpredictability of the regulatory review and approval processes in the U.S. and elsewhere; Exelixis’ continuing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; unexpected concerns that may arise as a result of the occurrence of adverse safety events or additional data analyses of clinical trials evaluating cabozantinib and other Exelixis product candidates; Exelixis’ dependence on third-party vendors for the development, manufacture and supply of its products and product candidates; Exelixis’ ability to protect its intellectual property rights; market competition, including the potential for competitors to obtain approval for generic versions of Exelixis’ marketed products; changes in economic and business conditions; and other factors detailed from time to time under the caption “Risk Factors” in Exelixis’ most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and in Exelixis’ other future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
