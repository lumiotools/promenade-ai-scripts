Additionally, the previously announced proposed reverse merger with YOOV Group Holding demonstrates our commitment to shareholder interests and our continuous pursuit of opportunities that enhance our corporate value.” \n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Group entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Company, and YOOV Group Holding Limited, a company organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands (“YOOV”). The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by Company’s and YOOV’s boards of directors (each board of directors, the “Board”), respectively. If the Merger Agreement is approved by Company’s and YOOV’s shareholders (and the other closing conditions are satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement), and upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Group will incorporate a wholly-owned subsidiary under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Merger Sub”) that will merge with and into YOOV, with YOOV surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group (collectively, the “Merger”). The Group, upon the closing of the merger is referred to herein as the “combined company.” Upon consummation of the transaction, YOOV will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, and the existing YOOV shareholders and existing Group shareholders will own approximately 90% and 10%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the combined company. The consummation of this merger remains uncertain as it is contingent upon the fulfillment of specific closing conditions. \n\n**Fiscal Year End Financial Results**\n\nAptorum Group reported a net loss of $4.3 million in 2023, as compared to $11.5 million in 2022. The decrease in net loss were largely attributed to disciplined cost control measures and a strategic concentration on our lead projects. These efforts led to a decrease in net loss by $7.2 million. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $5.2 million in 2023 as compared to $9.2 million in 2022. As a consequence of exclusive emphasis on its lead projects and suspension of non-lead projects, there was a notable decrease in the utilization of external consultants and full impairment of patents related to these non-lead projects. Moreover, the payroll expenses for research and development staff decreased as a result of the reversal of deferred cash bonus payables to employees and consultants, and reduction of employees during the current period. The reversal was due to the Group’s agreements with employees and consultants to discharge the Group’s obligation to settle their outstanding deferred cash bonus payables from previous years in exchange of fully vested ordinary shares. \n\nGeneral and administrative fees were $1.9 million in 2023 as compared to $5.2 million in 2022. The decrease in general and administrative fees was primary due to the reversal of deferred cash bonus payables to employees and reduction of employees during the current period. The reversal was due to the Group’s agreements with employees to discharge the Group’s obligation to settle their outstanding deferred cash bonus payables from previous years in exchange of fully vested ordinary shares. \n\nLegal and professional fees were $2.5 million in 2023 as compared to $2.9 million in 2022. The decrease in legal and professional fees was mainly due to less consulting services engaged during 2023 as a consequence of exclusive emphasis on its lead projects and suspension of non-lead projects. \n\nAptorum Group reported $2.0 million of cash as of December 31, 2023 compared to $5.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to the cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $7.7 million and repayment of bank loan of $3 million, partly offset by the proceeds from issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares through an at-the-market offering of $1.6 million, loan from related parties of $2.5 million, and proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of $3.0 million in 2023. \n\n**About Aptorum Group**\n\nAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs, particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications) and infectious diseases. The pipeline of Aptorum is also enriched through the co-development of PathsDx Test, a novel molecular-based rapid pathogen identification and detection diagnostics technology, with Accelerate Technologies Pte Ltd, commercialization arm of the Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research. \n\nFor more information about the Company, please visit [www.aptorumgroup.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aptorumgroup.com&esheet=53951917&newsitemid=20240424559376&lan=en-US&anchor=www.aptorumgroup.com&index=1&md5=8b849e30f05d82d68000043c78351752). \n\n**Disclaimer and Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of offers to buy any securities of Aptorum Group. \n\nThis press release includes statements concerning Aptorum Group Limited and its future expectations, plans and prospects that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(**“YOOV”**) jointly announced today that they entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the **“Merger Agreement”**). The Merger Agreement was approved by Aptorum’s and YOOV’s boards of directors (each board of directors, the “Board”), respectively. If the Merger Agreement is approved by Aptorum’s and YOOV’s shareholders (and the other closing conditions are satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement), and upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the **“Closing”** , and the date of the Closing, the **“Closing Date”**), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptorum organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“**Merger Sub** ”) will merge with and into YOOV (collectively, the **“Merger”**). \n\nIn addition, on March 1, 2024, Aptorum, its major shareholder, Jurchen Investment Corporation (“**Jurchen** ”), which is controlled by Ian Huen, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Aptorum, and Aptorum Therapeutics Limited (“**ATL** ”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptorum have entered into a split-off agreement (the “**Split-Off Agreement** ”). Pursuant to the Split-Off Agreement, Aptorum will assign and transfer the assets and liabilities of its legacy business to ATL, and Jurchen will acquire 100% issued and outstanding shares of ATL from Aptorum and surrender certain ordinary shares of Aptorum held by Jurchen to Aptorum (the “**Separation** ”). The Separation will become effective immediately following completion of the Merger. The Separation and the Merger are referred hereto as the “Proposed Transactions.” Aptorum upon the Closing is referred to herein as the “combined company.” \n\n**Merger Consideration**\n\nUpon completion of the Merger, the existing Aptorum shareholders and existing YOOV shareholders expect to own approximately 10% and 90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the combined company. Aptorum agreed to issue Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 each (the “**Class A ordinary shares** ”), and Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 each (the “**Class B ordinary shares** ”), to YOOV’s shareholders. The total number of ordinary shares of Aptorum to be issued in the merger equals the number of aggregate fully diluted shares of YOOV multiply by the “Conversion Ratio.” The Conversion Ratio is calculated by dividing (i) Aptorum’s outstanding Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares multiplied by nine (ii) by the aggregate fully diluted shares of YOOV. \n\nThis Merger is considered to be a “reverse merger” because the shareholders of YOOV will own more than a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company following the Merger. As such, the Merger is subject to NASDAQ’s approval of the combined company’s initial listing application. \n\n\"_This transaction marks a significant milestone for YOOV Group Holding_ _, and we are thrilled about the immense opportunities it brings. Listing on Nasdaq is a testament to our growth trajectory and we believe this will propel our company's development and expansion,_ ” said Phil Wong, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of YOOV Group Holding Limited. \n\n_“We are pleased to announce our proposed reverse merger with YOOV Group Holding, which we believe will be in the best interest of our shareholders,”_ said Ian Huen, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Aptorum Group. Mr. Huen added, _“YOOV is a promising AI-enabled software and automation platform. The merger is an exciting and important transaction that will take YOOV to listing on Nasdaq, which I believe will open further opportunities for the company to drive growth towards new heights.”_\n\n**Conditions to Closing of the Merger and the Separation**\n\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, but not limited to: (i) obtaining the approval by the shareholders of Aptorum and YOOV of the matters required under the Merger Agreement, (ii) approval of the Initial Listing Application by Nasdaq, (iii) delivery of legal opinions from British Virgin Islands counsel and Hong Kong counsel of YOOV to Aptorum and Merger Sub, (iv) delivery of legal opinions from Cayman Islands counsel of Aptorum and British Virgin Islands counsel of Merger Sub to YOOV, (v) delivery of a fairness opinion by Colliers International (Hong Kong) Limited to the Board of Aptorum to the effect that (subject to various qualifications and assumptions) that merger consideration (the total Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares to be issued to YOOV’s shareholders) is fair, from a financial point of view (based on the conclusion that the equity value of YOOV is no less than $250 million), to the shareholders of Aptorum. (vi) availability of audited financial statements for YOOV and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 the related audited consolidated statements of operations, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards, which shall not be materially different from the unaudited financial statements of YOOV for the same period as presented to Aptorum, as determined by Aptorum in its sole discretion, (vii) delivery of fully executed lock-up agreement and support agreement by the major shareholder of Aptorum and the delivery of fully executed lock-up agreement by the directors and officers of YOOV and by the shareholders of YOOV who will beneficially own 5% or more outstanding shares of the combined company. \n\nThe closing of the Separation is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, but not limited to: (i) proper transfer of shares, by way of duly endorsed certificates, by Aptorum to Jurchen, (ii) payment of the purchase price, by way of duly endorsed certificates, by Jurchen to Aptorum, (iii) proper transfer of records by Aptorum to ATL, as well as between Jurchen and ATL to Aptorum in regard to records that relate to Aptorum, (iv) delivery and exchange of Instruments of Assignment, as defined in the Split-off Agreement, between ATL and Jurchen, (v) delivery and execution of a release by Jurchen to ATL and Aptorum, (vi) approval by Aptorum shareholders as to the Separation outlined in the Split-off Agreement, and (vii) the simultaneous consummation of the Merger. \n\nFor further information regarding the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement and the Split-off Agreement, please see Aptorum’s current report on Form 6-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Merger and the Separation. \n\n**About YOOV Group Holding**\n\nYOOV is a business artificial intelligence (AI) and automation platform that goes beyond traditional automation by applying advanced AI techniques to optimize various aspects of business operations.

We continue to work towards advancing our ALS-4 and SACT-1 clinical programs and our PathsDx liquid biopsy program through potential collaborations. In light of the macroeconomic environment, we remain vigilant at controlling costs and resources of the company whilst continuing to advance our development objectives of the above programs as well,” said Mr. Ian Huen, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of Aptorum Group Limited. \n\n**Clinical Pipeline Update and Upcoming Milestones**\n\nIn January 2023, Aptorum Group announced publication of a co-authored paper on one of its lead project, PathsDx Technology, for assessing a rapid-turnaround low-depth unbiased metagenomics sequencing workflow on Illumina platforms. PathsDx Test was shown to be robust, rapid and sensitive for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The paper is titled, “Towards a rapid-turnaround low-depth unbiased metagenomics sequencing workflow on the Illumina platforms” and has been published online in Medrxiv, which can be downloaded at the following website address: [https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.01.02.22283504v1](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedrxiv.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Fshort%2F2023.01.02.22283504v1&esheet=53873887&newsitemid=20231221632368&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fmedrxiv.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Fshort%2F2023.01.02.22283504v1&index=1&md5=c269c85644b9714d7c4e1a78473d27af). \n\nIn March 2023, Aptorum Group announced the completion of the Pre-IND discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (“US FDA”) for ALS-4. ALS-4 is a first-in-class small molecule anti-virulence drug targeting infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including but not limited to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (“MRSA”). The Pre-IND discussions with US FDA focused on overall development plan in preparation for the IND application of ALS-4 that will initially target Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI). With the positive feedback on the overall development strategy from the US FDA, Aptorum is now proceeding towards the IND submission of ALS-4. \n\nIn June 2023, Aptorum Group announced the group has submitted the relevant Phase 1b/2a clinical trial protocol of SACT-1, an orally administered repurposed small molecule drug for the treatment of neuroblastoma to US FDA. The Phase 1b/2a study of SACT-1 submitted is for the combination with chemotherapy for first relapse or refractory high risk neuroblastoma. The targeted objectives of the Phase 1b part of the study based on neuroblastoma patients to be enrolled is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and the Phase 2a part of the study based on neuroblastoma patients to be enrolled will be used to assess the preliminary efficacy of SACT-1. \n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\nIn May 2023, Aptorum Group announced that its subsidiary, Aptorum Therapeutics Limited (“ATL”), a company incorporated under the laws of Grand Cayman Islands, entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent and Term Sheet (“Term Sheet”) to merge (“Transaction”) its 100% subsidiary, Paths Innovation Limited and its underlying business (collectively “PathsDx Group”) with Universal Sequencing Technology Corporation (“UST”), a San Diego and Boston based US company dedicated to the development and commercialization of advanced proprietary DNA sequencing technologies. Paths Innovation Limited currently holds, through its majority owned subsidiary Paths Diagnostics Pte. Limited, the PathsDx technology – a liquid biopsy NGS based technology for the diagnostics of infectious diseases. As consideration of the transaction upon closing, ATL will become a shareholder of the combined company. The Transaction and other ancillary distributions, where relevant, remain subject to, among other matters, the execution of a mutually agreeable definitive agreement, completion of due diligence and subject to several conditions including, but not limited to, director and shareholder approvals. \n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements to sell $3,000,000 unsecured convertible notes to 4 investors (the “June 23 Notes”). All the June 23 Notes were subsequently converted into an aggregate of 1,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.00001 per share. The whole proceeds from the June 23 Note was used to settle a related party loan. \n\nIn September 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement to sell a $3,000,000 unsecured convertible note (“Sep 23 Note”) to Jurchen Investment Corporation, the largest shareholder of the Group. The Sep 23 Note is convertible into the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares, and have a maturity date that is 24 months from the issuance date, although upon such date the investor has the right to extend the term of the Note for twelve (12) months or more or such term subject to mutual consent. The Sep 23 Note has an interest rate of 6% per annum and a conversion price of $2.42 per share. The Sep 23 Note is secured by a first priority lien and security interest on certain shares that the Company owns (“Collateral”). Upon the Company’s disposal of all or a portion of the Collateral, the investor has the right, to request that the Company prepay the then-remaining outstanding balance of the Sep 23 Note, in part or in full and the Company can make that payment in cash or in shares. \n\nIn November 2023, Aptorum Group announced the resignations of Mr. Darren Lui and Dr. Clark Cheng from their positions as executive directors and key officers. Concurrently, Mr. Ian Huen, a current director of the Company, took on the role of Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Huen previously served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer from October 2017 until his prior resignation in June 2022. With his extensive experience and contributions to the Company during significant events, the Board is confident that Mr. Huen will play a crucial role in realizing the Company's full potential. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company raised approximately $1,625,745 in gross proceeds pursuant to the issuance of an aggregate of 215,959 Class A ordinary shares under the Company’s $15 million at-the-market (“ATM”) program established on March 26, 2021. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and the Company’s development programs. \n\n**Financial Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**\n\nAptorum Group reported a net loss of $6.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in net loss in the current period was driven by there was a gain on non-marketable investment of $5.6 million in 2022 while there was no such gain in the current period. The increase is partly offset by the decrease in operating expenses due to the implementation of stringent budgetary control measures, as a result of the Company's exclusive emphasis on its lead projects. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $3.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $4.5 million for the same period in 2022. As a consequence of exclusive emphasis on its lead projects and suspension of non-lead projects, there was a notable decrease in the utilization of external consultants and full impairment of patents related to these non-lead projects. Moreover, the payroll expenses for research and development staff decreased as a result of the reversal of deferred cash bonus payables to employees and consultants during current period. The reversal was due to the Group’s agreements with employees and consultants to discharge the Group’s obligation to settle their outstanding deferred cash bonus payables from previous years in exchange of fully vested ordinary shares. \n\nGeneral and administrative fees were $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease in general and administrative fees was primary due to the reversal of deferred cash bonus payables to employees during current period. The reversal was due to the Group’s agreements with employees to discharge the Group’s obligation to settle their outstanding deferred cash bonus payables from previous years in exchange of fully vested ordinary shares. \n\nLegal and professional fees were $1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in legal and professional fees was attributed mainly to several non-routine activities undertaken during current period, such as the implementation of a reverse stock split and amendments to the memorandum and articles of association. These exercises involved engaging legal and professional services beyond regular operations, resulting in an increase in associated fees. \n\nAs of June 30, 2023, cash and restricted cash totaled approximately $0.5 million and total equity was approximately $12.8 million. \n\nIn September 2023, Aptorum Group received $3 million from the issuance of a convertible note. Aptorum Group expects that its existing cash and restricted cash together with undrawn line of credit facility from related parties, will enable it to fund its operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. \n\n**APTORUM GROUP LIMITED**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022**  \n**(Stated in U.S. Dollars)**  \n**June 30 ,** |  **December 31 ,**  \n**2023** |  **2022**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash  |  $  |  340,306  |  $  |  1,882,545   \nRestricted cash  |  130,335  |  3,130,335   \nAccounts receivable  |  66,396  |  174,426   \nInventories  |  -  |  27,722   \nMarketable securities, at fair value  |  -  |  102,481   \nAmounts due from related parties  |  95,768  |  129,677   \nDue from brokers  |  93,792  |  652   \nLoan receivable from a related party  |  422,800  |  875,956   \nOther receivables and prepayments  |  748,594  |  744,008   \n**Total current assets** |  1,897,991  |  7,067,802   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  2,190,146  |  2,825,059   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets  |  311,639  |  347,000   \nLong-term investments  |  9,744,958  |  9,744,958   \nIntangible assets, net  |  166,566  |  752,705   \nLong-term deposits  |  100,741  |  129,847   \n**Total Assets** |  $  |  14,412,041  |  $  |  20,867,371   \n**LIABILITIES AND EQUITY**  \n**LIABILITIES**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAmounts due to related parties  |  $  |  84,405  |  $  |  12,693   \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses  |  1,044,028  |  6,166,807   \nOperating lease liabilities, current  |  305,055  |  310,548   \nBank loan  |  -  |  3,000,000   \nConvertible notes  |  -  |  3,013,234   \n**Total current liabilities** |  1,433,488  |  12,503,282   \nOperating lease liabilities, non-current  |  199,076  |  30,784   \nLoan payables to related parties  |  -  |  500,000   \n**Total Liabilities** |  $  |  1,632,564  |  $  |  13,034,066   \n**Commitments and contingencies** |  **-** |  **-**  \n**EQUITY**  \nClass A Ordinary Shares ($0.00001 par value, 9,999,996,000,000 shares authorized,   \n2,937,921 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023;

For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Aptorum Group has based these forward-looking statements, which include statements regarding projected timelines for application submissions and trials, largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that it believes may affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions including, without limitation, risks related to its announced management and organizational changes, the continued service and availability of key personnel, its ability to expand its product assortments by offering additional products for additional consumer segments, development results, the company’s anticipated growth strategies, anticipated trends and challenges in its business, and its expectations regarding, and the stability of, its supply chain, and the risks more fully described in Aptorum Group’s Form 20-F and other filings that Aptorum Group may make with the SEC in the future. As a result, the projections included in such forward-looking statements are subject to change and actual results may differ materially from those described herein. \n\nAptorum Group assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this press release as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\nThis press release is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20231221632368r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231221632368/en/>\n\nAptorum Group Limited Investor Relations Department investor.relations@aptorumgroup.com +44 20 80929299 \n\nSource: Aptorum Group Limited\n\n[ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n\nEmail Page\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/investor-resources/email-alerts)\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/shareholder-services/rss-feeds)\n\n[×](#)\n\n##### Terms of Use\n\nThis Website contains information concerning Aptorum Group Limited (“Aptorum Group”) and its affiliates that may be useful to Aptorum Group’s customers, suppliers, employees, directors and shareholders, as well as members of the general public.
