Announces Financial Results for the Third Quarter of the Year Ending December 31, 2024 and an Increase in the Quarterly Dividend\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: HTBI) (\"Company\"), the holding company of HomeTrust Bank (\"Bank\"), today announced preliminary net income for the third quarter of the year ending December 31, 2024 and an increase in its quarterly cash dividend.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024:\n\n  * net income was $13.1 million compared to $12.4 million;\n  * diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") were $0.76 compared to $0.73;\n  * annualized return on assets (\"ROA\") was 1.17% compared to 1.13%;\n  * annualized return on equity (\"ROE\") was 9.76% compared to 9.58%;\n  * net interest margin was 4.00% compared to 4.08%;\n  * provision for credit losses was $3.0 million compared to $4.3 million; and\n  * quarterly cash dividends continued at $0.11 per share totaling $1.9 million for both periods.\n\n\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023:\n\n  * net income was $40.6 million compared to $36.6 million;\n  * diluted EPS were $2.37 compared to $2.18;\n  * annualized ROA was 1.22% compared to 1.15%;\n  * annualized ROE was 10.39% compared to 10.56%;\n  * net interest margin was 4.03% compared to 4.29%;\n  * provision for credit losses was $8.4 million compared to $11.7 million;\n  * tax-free death benefit proceeds from life insurance were $1.1 million for both periods; and\n  * cash dividends of $0.33 per share totaling $5.6 million compared to $0.30 per share totaling $5.1 million.\n\n\n\nResults for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include the impact of the merger of Quantum Capital Corp. (\"Quantum\") into the Company effective February 12, 2023. The addition of Quantum contributed total assets of $656.7 million, including loans of $561.9 million, and $570.6 million of deposits, all reflecting the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Merger-related expenses of $4.7 million were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while a $5.3 million provision for credit losses was recognized during the same period to establish allowances for credit losses on both Quantum's loan portfolio and off-balance-sheet credit exposure.\n\nThe Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share, reflecting a $0.01, or 9.0%, increase over the previous quarter's dividend. This is the sixth increase of the quarterly dividend since the Company initiated cash dividends in November 2018. The dividend is payable on November 27, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 14, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results,” said Hunter Westbrook, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We maintained our top quartile net interest margin, our ninth straight quarter at 4.00% or more. In addition, noninterest income and expense were both in line with prior quarters. Our provision for credit losses of $3.0 million included an additional $2.2 million as a reserve build for the potential impact of Hurricane Helene upon our loan portfolio. We have begun working with our loan customers on payment deferrals of up to six months, and although we aren’t currently aware of any collectability issues, we will continue assessing the impact of the storm upon our customer base.\n\n“As you know, many of the communities we serve were affected by this storm, impacting both our employees and customers. I’d first like to thank our employees who have assisted in maintaining bank operations while also tending to their personal and familial responsibilities. It has been amazing to watch the teamwork, collaboration and personal sacrifice across all areas of the Bank as we remained functionally operational throughout the storm, including our electronic banking services and online operations. Currently, all of our banking locations are open with most of the affected areas in our markets recovering well and operating close to normal. As for our customers in the affected areas, it will take time to assess, react and recover from Hurricane Helene. We are committed to working with them to provide the banking support needed for their businesses and homes.\n\n“Lastly, I am thankful for the Company's financial strength and geographic diversification which we have built over the last decade, with respect to both our employees and customer base, which provides the foundation to overcome unforeseen events such as this storm. We remain optimistic as we work together to continue the recovery.”\n\n**_WEBSITE: WWW.HTB.COM_**\n\n**Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024****and****June 30, 2024**** _Net Income._** Net income totaled $13.1 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $694,000, or 5.6%.

The increase was primarily the result of increases in the average balances of money market and certificate accounts, partially offset by a decline in average borrowings outstanding.\n\nThe following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including the difference in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities:\n\n**Increase / (Decrease)****Due to**| **Total****Increase /****(Decrease)**  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **Volume**| **Rate**  \n**Interest-earning assets**  \nLoans receivable| $| 916| $| 228| $| 1,144  \nDebt securities available for sale| 83| 38| 121  \nOther interest-earning assets| 76| (106| )| (30| )  \n**Total interest-earning assets**|  1,075| 160| 1,235  \n**Interest-bearing liabilities**  \nInterest-bearing checking accounts| (81| )| (86| )| (167| )  \nMoney market accounts| 413| 123| 536  \nSavings accounts| (1| )| —| (1| )  \nCertificate accounts| 1,341| 300| 1,641  \nJunior subordinated debt| 3| (2| )| 1  \nBorrowings| (708| )| 25| (683| )  \n**Total interest-bearing liabilities**|  967| 360| 1,327  \n**Decrease in net interest income**|  $| (92| )  \n  \n**_Provision for Credit Losses._** The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") at an appropriate level under the current expected credit losses model.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision for credit losses:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Provision for credit losses**  \nLoans| $| 2,990| $| 4,300| $| (1,310| )| (30| )%  \nOff-balance-sheet credit exposure| (15| )| (40| )| 25| 63  \n**Total provision for credit losses**|  $| 2,975| $| 4,260| $| (1,285| )| (30| )%   \n  \nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, offset by net charge-offs of $4.1 million during the quarter:\n\n  * $0.4 million benefit driven by changes in the loan mix.\n  * $1.2 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments. Included in this change was the addition of a $2.2 million qualitative allocation for the potential impact of Hurricane Helene upon our loan portfolio.\n  * $1.9 million decrease in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans as we charged-off specific reserves which had previously been established.\n\n\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of $2.6 million during the quarter:\n\n  * $0.1 million provision driven by changes in the loan mix.\n  * $0.4 million benefit due to changes in the projected economic forecast and changes in qualitative adjustments.\n  * $2.0 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans which was proportional to the increase in the associated loan balances which increased from $8.3 million to $16.3 million quarter-over-quarter, concentrated in the equipment finance and SBA portfolios.\n\n\n\nFor the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the amounts recorded for off-balance-sheet credit exposure were the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments, loan mix and projected economic forecast as outlined above.\n\n**_Noninterest Income._** Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $169,000, or 2.1%, when compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

There were $21.7 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale which were sold during the current quarter with gains of $479,000 compared to $21.3 million sold with gains of $351,000 in the prior quarter, with the improvement in profitability due to movement in interest rates. There were $54.6 million of HELOCs sold for a gain of $414,000 compared to $32.9 million sold with gains of $457,000 in the prior quarter. There were $12.9 million in sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $1.0 million for the quarter compared to $12.7 million sold and gains of $1.1 million for the prior quarter. Our hedging of mandatory commitments on the residential mortgage loan pipeline resulted in a gain of $18,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 versus a loss of $58,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Expense._** Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $375,000, or 1.2%, when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Changes in the components of noninterest expense are discussed below:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Noninterest expense**  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 17,082| $| 16,608| $| 474| 3| %  \nOccupancy expense, net| 2,436| 2,419| 17| 1  \nComputer services| 3,192| 3,116| 76| 2  \nTelephone, postage and supplies| 547| 580| (33| )| (6| )  \nMarketing and advertising| 408| 606| (198| )| (33| )  \nDeposit insurance premiums| 589| 531| 58| 11  \nCore deposit intangible amortization| 567| 567| —| —  \nOther| 5,764| 5,783| (19| )| —  \n**Total noninterest expense**|  $| 30,585| $| 30,210| $| 375| 1| %  \n  \n  * _Salaries and employee benefits:_ The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily the result of executive pay increases effective this quarter and additional stock incentive expense associated with the vesting of performance-based equity awards.\n  * _Marketing and advertising:_ The decrease in expense was the result of both differences in the timing of when expenses were incurred quarter-over-quarter as well as a reduction in traditional media advertising (print, billboards, etc.) in favor of digital platforms at lower costs.\n\n\n\n**_Income Taxes._** The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were 21.9% and 21.4%, respectively.\n\n**Comparison of Results of Operations for the****Nine Months Ended** **September 30, 2024****and****September 30, 2023**** _Net Income._** Net income totaled $40.6 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $36.6 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $4.0 million, or 11.0%. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by a decrease of $3.3 million in the provision for credit losses, a $1.4 million increase in noninterest income, and a $2.6 million decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in net interest income and a $1.3 million increase in income tax expense.

Accretion income on acquired loans of $2.0 million and $1.7 million was recognized during the same periods, respectively, and was included in interest income on loans. The overall increase in average yield on interest-earning assets was the result of both higher average balances and rising interest rates.\n\nTotal interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $25.8 million, or 58.4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily the result of increases in the cost of funds across all funding sources driven by higher market interest rates and increases in the average balances of money market and certificate accounts, partially offset by a decline in average borrowings outstanding.\n\nThe following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including the difference in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities:\n\n**Increase / (Decrease)****Due to**| **Total****Increase /****(Decrease)**  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **Volume**| **Rate**  \n**Interest-earning assets**  \nLoans receivable| $| 8,927| $| 13,965| $| 22,892  \nDebt securities available for sale| (532| )| 1,176| 644  \nOther interest-earning assets| 79| 141| 220  \n**Total interest-earning assets**|  8,474| 15,282| 23,756  \n**Interest-bearing liabilities**  \nInterest-bearing checking accounts| (266| )| 1,174| 908  \nMoney market accounts| 1,557| 10,481| 12,038  \nSavings accounts| (20| )| 1| (19| )  \nCertificate accounts| 6,592| 9,219| 15,811  \nJunior subordinated debt| 109| 33| 142  \nBorrowings| (3,425| )| 341| (3,084| )  \n**Total interest-bearing liabilities**|  4,547| 21,249| 25,796  \n**Decrease in net interest income**|  $| (2,040| )  \n  \n**_Provision for Credit Losses._** The following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision for credit losses:\n\n**Nine Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Provision for credit losses**  \nLoans| $| 8,435| $| 12,120| $| (3,685| )| (30| )%  \nOff-balance-sheet credit exposure| (35| )| (385| )| 350| 91  \n**Total provision for credit losses**|  $| 8,400| $| 11,735| $| (3,335| )| (28| )%   \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of net charge-offs of $8.9 million during the period, partially offset by a $0.4 million benefit due to changes in the loan mix.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of $3.9 million during the period:\n\n  * $4.9 million provision to establish an allowance on Quantum's loan portfolio.\n  * $3.0 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments.\n  * $0.3 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated credits.\n\n\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the amounts recorded for off-balance-sheet credit exposure were the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments, loan mix and projected economic forecast as outlined above.\n\n**_Noninterest Income._** Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1.4 million, or 5.8%, when compared to the same period last year. Changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below:\n\n**Nine Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Noninterest income**  \nService charges and fees on deposit accounts| $| 6,839| $| 6,967| $| (128| )| (2| )%  \nLoan income and fees| 2,009| 1,913| 96| 5  \nGain on sale of loans held for sale| 5,185| 4,213| 972| 23  \nBOLI income| 3,470| 2,844| 626| 22  \nOperating lease income| 5,087| 4,515| 572| 13  \nGain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment| (9| )| 982| (991| )| (101| )  \nOther| 2,625| 2,391| 234| 10  \n**Total noninterest income**|  $| 25,206| $| 23,825| $| 1,381| 6| %  \n  \n  * _Gain on sale of loans held for sale:_ The increase in the gain on sale of loans held for sale was primarily driven by residential mortgage and SBA loans sold during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were $58.3 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale which were sold with gains of $1.1 million compared to $48.7 million sold with gains of $633,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year, with the improvement in profitability due to movement in interest rates. There were $38.5 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $3.1 million compared to $41.1 million sold and gains of $2.6 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $95.4 million of HELOCs sold during the current period for a gain of $887,000 compared to $66.4 million sold and gains of $552,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year. Our hedging of mandatory commitments on the residential mortgage loan pipeline resulted in a gain of $15,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a gain of $426,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * _BOLI income:_ The increase was due to higher yielding policies as a result of restructuring the portfolio at the end of the prior calendar year.\n  * _Operating lease income:_ The increase in operating lease income was the result of $1.7 million in additional contractual earnings on a higher average outstanding balance of the associated contracts, partially offset by losses incurred on previously leased equipment, where we recognized a net loss of $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a net loss of $210,000 in the same period last year.\n  * _Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment:_ During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, two properties were sold for a combined gain of $982,000. No material disposal activity occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Expense._** Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $2.6 million, or 2.8%, when compared to the same period last year. Changes in the components of noninterest expense are discussed below:\n\n**Nine Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Noninterest expense**  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 50,666| $| 49,436| $| 1,230| 2| %  \nOccupancy expense, net| 7,292| 7,556| (264| )| (3| )  \nComputer services| 9,396| 9,386| 10| —  \nTelephone, postage and supplies| 1,712| 1,942| (230| )| (12| )  \nMarketing and advertising| 1,659| 1,555| 104| 7  \nDeposit insurance premiums| 1,674| 1,878| (204| )| (11| )  \nCore deposit intangible amortization| 1,896| 2,324| (428| )| (18| )  \nMerger-related expenses| —| 4,741| (4,741| )| (100| )  \nOther| 16,364| 14,490| 1,874| 13  \n**Total noninterest expense**|  $| 90,659| $| 93,308| $| (2,649| )| (3| )%  \n  \n  * _Salaries_ _and employee benefits_ : The increase was primarily the result of pay increases, partially offset by reductions in incentive pay.\n  * _Core deposit intangible amortization:_ The intangible recorded associated with the Quantum merger is being amortized on an accelerated basis, so the rate of amortization slowed year-over-year.\n  * _Merger-related expenses:_ The prior period included expenses associated with the Company's merger with Quantum. No such expenses were incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * _Other:_ The increase period-over-period was primarily driven by $1.7 million of additional depreciation expense on equipment subject to operating leases.\n\n\n\n**_Income Taxes._** The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 21.3% and 21.0%, respectively.\n\n**Balance Sheet Review** Total assets decreased by $35.3 million to $4.6 billion and total liabilities decreased by $75.5 million to $4.1 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The majority of these changes were the result of an increase in deposits, which, combined with the collection of BOLI redemption proceeds and cash and cash equivalents, were used to fund growth in loans and pay down borrowings.\n\nStockholders' equity increased $40.1 million to $540.0 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Activity within stockholders' equity included $40.6 million in net income and $4.5 million in stock-based compensation and stock option exercises, partially offset by $5.6 million in cash dividends declared. In addition, the improvement in the accumulated other comprehensive income was driven by a $1.6 million reduction of the unrealized loss on available for sale securities as a result of a decrease in market interest rates.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\n\n**Asset Quality** The ACL on loans was $48.1 million, or 1.30% of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to $48.6 million, or 1.34% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The drivers of this change are discussed in the \"Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 – Provision for Credit Losses\" section above.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled $8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.9 million for the same period last year. As discussed in previous quarters, the increase in net charge-offs has been concentrated in our equipment finance portfolio, primarily smaller over-the-road truck loans, with net charge-offs of $5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In response, during the first quarter of calendar year 2024 the Company elected to cease further originations within the transportation sector of equipment finance loans. In spite of the increase, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average assets for the loan portfolio as a whole were 0.31% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in line with the Company's historical experience, as compared to 0.14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNonperforming assets, made up of nonaccrual loans and repossessed assets, increased by $10.4 million, or 54.0%, to $29.8 million, or 0.64% of total assets, at September 30, 2024 compared to $19.3 million, or 0.41% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Consistent with the change in net charge-offs, equipment finance loans made up the largest portion of nonperforming assets at $8.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, at these same dates. In addition, owner occupied commercial real estate totaled $7.2 million and $912,000, respectively, at these same dates. These increases were mainly the result of a $3.1 million medical equipment relationship and $5.1 million owner occupied commercial real estate (OO CRE) relationship; however, in both cases losses are not currently anticipated. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.78% at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.53% at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe ratio of classified assets to total assets increased to 0.99% at September 30, 2024 from 0.90% at December 31, 2023 as classified assets increased $4.1 million, or 9.8%, to $46.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $42.0 million at December 31, 2023. The largest portfolios of classified assets at September 30, 2024 included $11.7 million of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, $8.4 million of equipment finance loans, $7.1 million of SBA loans, $6.0 million of 1-4 family residential real estate loans, and $6.0 million of OO CRE loans.\n\n**About HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc**.HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is the holding company for the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had assets of $4.6 billion.

Announces Financial Results for the Second Quarter of the Year Ending December 31, 2024 and Declaration of a Quarterly Dividend\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C., July 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: HTBI) (\"Company\" or \"HomeTrust\"), the holding company of HomeTrust Bank (\"Bank\"), today announced preliminary net income for the second quarter of the year ending December 31, 2024 and approval of its quarterly cash dividend.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024:\n\n  * net income was $12.4 million compared to $15.1 million;\n  * diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") were $0.73 compared to $0.88;\n  * annualized return on assets (\"ROA\") was 1.13% compared to 1.37%;\n  * annualized return on equity (\"ROE\") was 9.58% compared to 11.91%;\n  * net interest margin was 4.08% compared to 4.02%;\n  * provision for credit losses was $4.3 million compared to $1.2 million;\n  * tax-free death benefit proceeds from life insurance were $0 compared to $1.1 million;\n  * The Company repurchased 23,483 shares of its outstanding common stock during the quarter at an average price of $27.48; and\n  * quarterly cash dividends continued at $0.11 per share totaling $1.9 million for both periods.\n\n\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023:\n\n  * net income was $27.5 million compared to $21.8 million;\n  * diluted EPS were $1.61 compared to $1.30;\n  * annualized ROA was 1.25% compared to 1.06%;\n  * annualized ROE was 10.73% compared to 9.65%;\n  * net interest margin was 4.05% compared to 4.43%;\n  * provision for credit losses was $5.4 million compared to $9.2 million;\n  * tax-free death benefit proceeds from life insurance were $1.1 million compared to $0; and\n  * cash dividends of $0.22 per share totaling $3.7 million compared to $0.20 per share totaling $3.4 million.\n\n\n\nResults for the six months ended June 30, 2023 include the impact of the merger of Quantum Capital Corp. (\"Quantum\") into the Company effective February 12, 2023. The addition of Quantum contributed total assets of $656.7 million, including loans of $561.9 million, and $570.6 million of deposits, all reflecting the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Merger-related expenses of $4.7 million were recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2023, while a $5.3 million provision for credit losses was recognized during the same period to establish allowances for credit losses on both Quantum's loan portfolio and off-balance-sheet credit exposure.\n\nThe Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per common share payable on August 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2024.\n\n“Our financial results for the second quarter continue to reflect our goal of high performance combined with our strategy of being a best place to work,” said Hunter Westbrook, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our performance remained strong, aided by the expansion of our top quartile net interest margin which remains was again above 4.00%, while noninterest income and expense were both in line with the prior quarter. The decrease in our net income this quarter is reflective of an allowance build for potential credit losses on individual equipment finance and SBA loans that are in the early stages of collateral and collectability evaluation.\n\n“As previously announced, HomeTrust was recently named a 2024 Best Place to Work in South Carolina by the Best Companies Group, supplementing our prior quarter Newsweek certification as a 2024 Most Loved Workplace. This is further validation of the culture we have developed at HomeTrust, which directly impacts our ability to continue as a high-performing, regional community bank.”\n\n**_WEBSITE: WWW.HTB.COM_**\n\n**Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended****June 30, 2024****and****March 31, 2024**** _Net Income._** Net income totaled $12.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to net income of $15.1 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 17.6%.

Accretion income on acquired loans of $678,000 and $715,000 was recognized during the same periods, respectively, and was included in interest income on loans.\n\nTotal interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $1.1 million, or 5.1%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was the result of both increases in the average cost of funds, due to increased market rates, and average balances across interest-bearing deposit types, partially offset by a decline in average borrowings outstanding.\n\nThe following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including differences in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities:\n\n**Increase / (Decrease)****Due to**| **Total****Increase /****(Decrease)**  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **Volume**| **Rate**  \n**Interest-earning assets**  \nLoans receivable| $| 325| $| 1,884| $| 2,209  \nDebt securities available for sale| 79| 103| 182  \nOther interest-earning assets| 141| (473| )| (332| )  \n**Total interest-earning assets**|  545| 1,514| 2,059  \n**Interest-bearing liabilities**  \nInterest-bearing checking accounts| (10| )| 29| 19  \nMoney market accounts| 127| 430| 557  \nSavings accounts| (1| )| (1| )| (2| )  \nCertificate accounts| 158| 633| 791  \nJunior subordinated debt| 1| (3| )| (2| )  \nBorrowings| (241| )| 1| (240| )  \n**Total interest-bearing liabilities**|  34| 1,089| 1,123  \n**Increase in net interest income**|  $| 936  \n  \n**_Provision for Credit Losses._** The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") at an appropriate level under the current expected credit losses model.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision for credit losses:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Provision for credit losses**  \nLoans| $| 4,300| $| 1,145| $| 3,155| 276| %  \nOff-balance-sheet credit exposure| (40| )| 20| (60| )| (300| )  \n**Total provision for credit losses**|  $| 4,260| $| 1,165| $| 3,095| 266| %  \n  \nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of $2.6 million during the quarter:\n\n  * $0.1 million provision driven by changes in the loan mix.\n  * $0.4 million benefit due to changes in the projected economic forecast and changes in qualitative adjustments.\n  * $2.0 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans which was proportional to the increase in the associated loan balances which increased from $8.3 million to $16.3 million quarter-over-quarter, concentrated in the equipment finance and SBA portfolios. Further information on the change in nonperforming loans may be found in the \"Asset Quality\" section.\n\n\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, offset by net charge-offs of $2.3 million during the quarter:\n\n  * $0.1 million benefit driven by changes in the loan mix.\n  * $0.9 million benefit due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments.\n  * $0.2 million decrease in specific reserves on individually evaluated credits.\n\n\n\nFor the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the amounts recorded for off-balance-sheet credit exposure were the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments, loan mix and projected economic forecast as outlined above.\n\n**_Noninterest Income._** Noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $698,000, or 7.9%, when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Noninterest income**  \nService charges and fees on deposit accounts| $| 2,354| $| 2,149| $| 205| 10| %  \nLoan income and fees| 647| 678| (31| )| (5| )  \nGain on sale of loans held for sale| 1,828| 1,457| 371| 25  \nBank owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") income| 807| 1,835| (1,028| )| (56| )  \nOperating lease income| 1,591| 1,859| (268| )| (14| )  \nLoss on sale of premises and equipment| —| (9| )| 9| 100  \nOther| 886| 842| 44| 5  \n**Total noninterest income**|  $| 8,113| $| 8,811| $| (698| )| (8| )%  \n  \n  * _Service charges and fees on deposit accounts:_ The change was due to a $154,000 increase in debit card fees quarter-over-quarter.\n  * _Gain on sale of loans held for sale:_ The increase was primarily driven by HELOCs sold during the period. There were $32.9 million of HELOCs sold for a gain of $457,000 compared to $7.8 million sold with gains of $16,000 in the prior quarter. There were $21.3 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale which were sold during the current quarter with gains of $351,000 compared to $15.3 million sold with gains of $316,000 in the prior quarter. There were $12.7 million in sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $1.1 million for the quarter compared to $12.9 million sold and gains of $1.1 million for the prior quarter. Our hedging of mandatory commitments on the residential mortgage loan pipeline resulted in a loss of $58,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 versus a gain of $55,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n  * _BOLI income:_ The decrease was due to $1.1 million in tax-free gains on death benefit proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies recognized during the prior quarter. No death benefit proceeds were recognized during the current quarter.\n  * _Operating lease income:_ The decrease was the result of an increase of $497,000 in losses incurred on previously leased equipment, partially offset by an increase of $228,000 in contractual earnings on a larger average outstanding balance.\n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Expense._** Noninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $346,000, or 1.2%, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. Changes in the components of noninterest expense are discussed below:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Noninterest expense**  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 16,608| $| 16,976| $| (368| )| (2| )%  \nOccupancy expense, net| 2,419| 2,437| (18| )| (1| )  \nComputer services| 3,116| 3,088| 28| 1  \nTelephone, postage and supplies| 580| 585| (5| )| (1| )  \nMarketing and advertising| 606| 645| (39| )| (6| )  \nDeposit insurance premiums| 531| 554| (23| )| (4| )  \nCore deposit intangible amortization| 567| 762| (195| )| (26| )  \nOther| 5,783| 4,817| 966| 20  \n**Total noninterest expense**|  $| 30,210| $| 29,864| $| 346| 1| %  \n  \n  * _Core deposit intangible amortization:_ The intangible recorded associated with the QNB merger is being amortized on an accelerated basis, so the rate of amortization slowed quarter-over-quarter.\n  * _Other:_ The increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily the result of $279,000 of additional depreciation expense on equipment subject to operating leases in addition to smaller increases across several other expense categories.\n\n\n\n**_Income Taxes._** The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. The effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were 21.4% and 20.8%, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by $1.1 million of tax-free gains on BOLI death benefit proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies during the prior quarter.\n\n**Comparison of Results of Operations for the****Six Months Ended** **June 30, 2024****and****June 30, 2023**** _Net Income._** Net income totaled $27.5 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to net income of $21.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $5.7 million, or 26.4%. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were positively impacted by a decrease of $3.7 million in the provision for credit losses and a $4.7 million decrease in merger-related expenses. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below.\n\n**_Net Interest Income._** The following table presents the distribution of average assets, liabilities and equity, as well as interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities.

The overall increase in average yield on interest-earning assets was the result of both higher average balances and rising interest rates.\n\nTotal interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $20.9 million, or 85.6%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of increases in the average balances and cost of funds across all funding sources driven by higher market interest rates, as well as the inclusion of Quantum's portfolio for the entire period, unlike last year.\n\nThe following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including differences in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities:\n\n**Increase / (Decrease)****Due to**| **Total****Increase /****(Decrease)**  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **Volume**| **Rate**  \n**Interest-earning assets**  \nLoans receivable| $| 8,510| $| 9,573| $| 18,083  \nDebt securities available for sale| (463| )| 750| 287  \nOther interest-earning assets| 125| 477| 602  \n**Total interest-earning assets**|  8,172| 10,800| 18,972  \n**Interest-bearing liabilities**  \nInterest-bearing checking accounts| (169| )| 915| 746  \nMoney market accounts| 890| 8,118| 9,008  \nSavings accounts| (15| )| 2| (13| )  \nCertificate accounts| 4,117| 7,617| 11,734  \nJunior subordinated debt| 104| 39| 143  \nBorrowings| (1,031| )| 339| (692| )  \n**Total interest-bearing liabilities**|  3,896| 17,030| 20,926  \n**Decrease in net interest income**|  $| (1,954| )  \n  \n**_Provision for Credit Losses._** The following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision for credit losses:\n\n**Six Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Provision for credit losses**  \nLoans| $| 5,445| $| 9,270| $| (3,825| )| (41| )%  \nOff-balance-sheet credit exposure| (20| )| (105| )| 85| 81  \n**Total provision for credit losses**|  $| 5,425| $| 9,165| $| (3,740| )| (41| )%  \n  \nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of $4.9 million during the period:\n\n  * $1.3 million benefit due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments.\n  * $1.8 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans which was proportional to the increase in the associated loan balances which increased from $8.1 million to $16.3 million during the six month period, concentrated in the equipment finance and SBA portfolios. Further information on the change in nonperforming loans may be found in the \"Asset Quality\" section.\n\n\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the \"loans\" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of $1.3 million during the period:\n\n  * $4.9 million provision to establish an allowance on Quantum's loan portfolio.\n  * $2.1 million provision driven by loan growth and changes in the loan mix.\n  * $0.9 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments.\n  * $0.1 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated credits.\n\n\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the amounts recorded for off-balance-sheet credit exposure were the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments, loan mix and projected economic forecast as outlined above.\n\n**_Noninterest Income._** Noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $1.7 million, or 11.4%, when compared to the same period last year. Changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below:\n\n**Six Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**Noninterest income**  \nService charges and fees on deposit accounts| $| 4,503| $| 4,649| $| (146| )| (3| )%  \nLoan income and fees| 1,325| 1,354| (29| )| (2| )  \nGain on sale of loans held for sale| 3,285| 2,920| 365| 13  \nBOLI income| 2,642| 1,095| 1,547| 141  \nOperating lease income| 3,450| 2,730| 720| 26  \nGain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment| (9| )| 982| (991| )| (101| )  \nOther| 1,728| 1,468| 260| 18  \n**Total noninterest income**|  $| 16,924| $| 15,198| $| 1,726| 11| %  \n  \n  * _Gain on sale of loans held for sale:_ The increase in the gain on sale of loans held for sale was primarily driven by HELOCs and SBA loans sold during the period. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were $40.7 million of HELOCs sold for a gain of $473,000 compared to $35.2 million sold and gains of $354,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $25.6 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $2.1 million compared to $28.8 million sold and gains of $1.9 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $36.6 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale which were sold during the current period with gains of $667,000 compared to $28.4 million sold with gains of $382,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year. Our hedging of mandatory commitments on the residential mortgage loan pipeline resulted in a loss of $3,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 versus a gain of $268,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n  * _BOLI income:_ The increase was due to the combined effect of $1.1 million in tax-free gains on death benefit proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies recognized and higher yielding policies as a result of restructuring the portfolio at the end of the prior calendar year.\n  * _Operating lease income:_ The increase was the result of $1.2 million in additional contractual earnings on a higher average outstanding balance of the associated contracts, partially offset by losses incurred on previously leased equipment, where we recognized net losses of $787,000 and $262,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * _Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment:_ During the six months ended June 30, 2023, two properties were sold for a combined gain of $982,000. No material disposal activity occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n  * _Other:_ The increase was driven by a $270,000 increase in investment services income recognized period-over-period.\n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Expense._** Noninterest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $3.7 million, or 5.8%, when compared to the same period last year.

No such expenses were incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n  * _Other:_ The increase period-over-period was primarily driven by $1.0 million of additional depreciation expense on equipment subject to operating leases, partially offset by a decrease of $314,000 in fraud losses.\n\n\n\n**_Income Taxes._** The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. The effective tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 were 21.1% and 21.3%, respectively.\n\n**Balance Sheet Review** Total assets decreased by $1.8 million to $4.7 billion and total liabilities decreased by $25.5 million to $4.1 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The majority of these changes were the result of an increase in deposits, which, combined with the collection of BOLI redemption proceeds, were used to fund growth in loans and pay down borrowings.\n\nStockholders' equity increased $23.7 million to $523.6 million at June 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Activity within stockholders' equity included $27.5 million in net income, partially offset by $3.7 million in cash dividends declared. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\n\n**Asset Quality** The ACL on loans was $49.2 million, or 1.33% of total loans, at June 30, 2024 compared to $48.6 million, or 1.34% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The drivers of the changes between periods are discussed in the \"Comparison of Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 – Provision for Credit Losses\" section above.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled $4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $1.3 million for the same period last year. As discussed in previous quarters, the increase in net charge-offs has been concentrated in our equipment finance portfolio, primarily smaller over-the-road truck loans, with net charge-offs of $3.4 million during the identified period. In response, during the first quarter of calendar year 2024 the Company elected to cease further originations within the transportation sector of equipment finance loans. In spite of the increase, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average assets were 0.25% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, in line with the Company's historical experience, as compared to 0.07% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nNonperforming assets, made up entirely of nonaccrual loans for both periods, increased by $5.9 million, or 30.7%, to $25.3 million, or 0.54% of total assets, at June 30, 2024 compared to $19.3 million, or 0.41% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Consistent with the change in net charge-offs, equipment finance loans made up the largest portion of nonperforming assets at $10.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, at these same dates; however, the increase between these two dates was mainly the result of a $3.1 million medical equipment relationship where a loss is not currently anticipated. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.68% at June 30, 2024 compared to 0.53% at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe ratio of classified assets to total assets increased to 0.91% at June 30, 2024 from 0.90% at December 31, 2023 as classified assets increased $696,000, or 1.7%, to $42.7 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $42.0 million at December 31, 2023. The largest portfolios of classified assets at June 30, 2024 included $11.8 million of non-owner occupied commercial real estate (NOO CRE) loans, $10.6 million of equipment finance loans, $8.1 million of SBA loans, and $5.2 million of 1-4 family residential real estate loans.\n\n**About HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc**.HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is the holding company for the Bank. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had assets of $4.7 billion.
