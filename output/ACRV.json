(“Acrivon” or “Acrivon Therapeutics”) (Nasdaq: ACRV), a clinical stage precision medicine company utilizing its Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics (AP3) platform for the discovery, design, and development of drug candidates through a mechanistic match to patients whose disease is predicted sensitive to the specific treatment, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and reviewed recent business highlights.\n\n“Our team continues to deliver impressive progress advancing a pipeline of differentiated clinical stage therapies,” said Peter Blume-Jensen, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer, president, and founder of Acrivon. “During the third quarter, we shared promising data from our Phase 2b study of ACR-368, demonstrating a confirmed 62.5% ORR in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer - a tumor type identified by AP3 as sensitive to ACR-368. Equally important, we further validated our ACR-368 OncoSignature prospective patient selection with a _p-value =_ 0.009. We continue to believe endometrial cancer provides the first potential approval opportunity for ACR-368. Our recently conducted, blinded KOL market research confirmed the significant unmet need for the approximately 30,000 annual new cases of high-grade endometrial cancer in the U.S., and we believe that ACR-368 could offer an important treatment option for this devastating disease. In addition, we advanced ACR-2316 into the clinic ahead of schedule in just 15 months from initial lead to Phase 1 trial initiation, uniquely enabled by AP3, with the planned first dose-escalation cohort now fully enrolled. These significant milestones underscore the power of our proprietary generative AI and machine learning-driven AP3 Interactome applied to our growing in-house data sets for streamlined drug discovery and clinical development.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Presented positive interim endometrial cancer data at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress (ESMO) and at a subsequent corporate event, from the ongoing, registrational-intent, multicenter Phase 2b trial of ACR-368 in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma who had progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy, unless ineligible. Endometrial cancer had not been previously studied in prior ACR-368 trials sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company. Using AP3 for indication screening, this tumor type was predicted to be particularly sensitive to ACR-368 prior to the current ongoing Phase 2b study. The data were based on 35 safety-evaluable patients, of which 23 (8 OncoSignature-positive (BM+) and 15 OncoSignature-negative (BM-) patients) were efficacy-evaluable with at least one on-treatment scan (data cut-off July 25, 2024). \n    * Confirmed ORR, per RECIST 1.1, of 62.5% (95% CI, 30.4-86.5) was observed in the cohort of prospectively-selected BM+ patients who were efficacy-evaluable \n      * Median duration of response (mDOR) was not yet reached at the time of data cut-off (~6 months)\n      * All confirmed responders had progressed on prior chemo and anti-PD-1 therapy and best overall response (BOR) in last prior line was predominantly progressive disease (PD) in the confirmed ACR-368 responders\n      * Consistent with the ACR-368 OncoSignature prediction being independent of genetic alterations and tissue type, confirmed responses were observed across molecular and histological subtypes\n    * Achieved statistically significant segregation of responders in BM+ versus BM- subgroups based on prospective OncoSignature patient selection (_p-value_ = 0.009)\n    * Consistent with past trials and earlier reported data from this trial, the ACR-368 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) observed were limited, predominantly transient, reversible, mechanism-based hematological AEs, which typically occurred during the first 1-2 cycles of therapy. There was a notable absence of long-lasting myelosuppression, or the typical more severe non-hematological AEs commonly seen with antibody drug conjugates and chemotherapy.\n  * Provided a summary of company-conducted, blinded third-party KOL market research which showed strong interest in the emerging clinical profile of ACR-368 (product name blinded) as an important potential therapy in the rapidly evolving treatment landscape of high-grade, recurrent endometrial cancer where second-line options are now limited due to the recent approval of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy as front-line therapy \n    * An estimated ~30K new cases of high-grade, locally advanced or metastatic, recurrent (progressed on anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy) endometrial cancer per year in the U.S. \n    * ~90% of these patients will progress to second line\n    * The recent approval of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as a front-line treatment leaves a significant unmet need in the second line, where the bar based on reported chemotherapy efficacy in the second line is an ORR of 14.7% and median progress-free survival of 3.8 months (_Makker et al; N Engl J Medicine, 2022_), which potentially overestimates the current ORR for chemotherapy in the second line, given this was based on patients that had only received prior chemotherapy, but not prior anti-PD-1\n    * The company’s ongoing single-arm, registrational-intent Phase 2b monotherapy trial in endometrial cancer represents the first potential accelerated approval opportunity for ACR-368\n    * The company is evaluating options to potentially move into the front-line setting as part of its confirmatory trial strategy\n  * Began dosing patients, two quarters ahead of original timelines, in the Phase 1 monotherapy clinical trial of ACR-2316, a potent, selective WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor designed by AP3 to overcome the limitations of single-target WEE1 and PKMYT1 inhibitors \n    * ACR-2316 was internally discovered and advanced in 15 months from initial lead to Phase 1 trial initiation, which was uniquely enabled by AP3\n    * The Phase 1 study will assess the safety and tolerability of ACR-2316. Additionally, the study will seek to establish the pharmacokinetic profile, evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity and determine the recommended Phase 2 monotherapy dose. Dose optimization will be guided by drug target engagement in alignment with the Food and Drug Administration’s Project Optimus. AP3-based indication finding and OncoSignature development is ongoing.\n    * Completed planned enrollment of the first patient cohort of the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial\n  * Presented multiple datasets demonstrating the deployment of the company’s AP3 platform for streamlined, machine learning-driven drug discovery and clinical development at two scientific conferences - Human Proteome Organization World Congress and EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium \n    * AP3-identified clinical biomarkers for ACR-368 led to the development of the response-predictive ACR-368 OncoSignature assay which has shown statistically significant prospective validation and responder enrichment in the ongoing registrational-intent Phase 2b study\n    * ACR-2316 was uniquely enabled and optimized by AP3 to deliver superior single-agent activity, complete tumor regression and pro-apoptotic tumor cell death through potent activation of CDK1, CDK2, and PLK1 \n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Provide program updates from our ongoing registrational-intent Phase 2b trial of ACR-368 in patients with gynecological cancers prospectively predicted sensitive to ACR-368 in the first half of 2025\n  * Report initial data from the Phase 1 clinical study of ACR-2316, which is enriched for tumor types predicted to be sensitive to monotherapy through AP3-based indication finding, in the second half of 2025\n  * Advance a new potential first-in-class cell cycle drug discovery program for an undisclosed target towards development candidate nomination in 2025\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $22.4 million compared to a net loss of $14.5 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $18.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $10.3 million for the same period in 2023. The difference was primarily due to the continued development of ACR-368 -- which included the progression of the ongoing clinical trial and the achievement of milestones for the companion diagnostic, the initiation of the ACR-2316 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2024, and increased personnel costs to support these development activities.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2023. The difference was primarily due to increased personnel costs, inclusive of non-cash stock compensation expense.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $202.8 million, which is expected to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2026.\n\n**About Acrivon Therapeutics** Acrivon is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing precision oncology medicines that it matches to patients whose tumors are predicted to be sensitive to each specific medicine by utilizing Acrivon’s proprietary proteomics-based patient responder identification platform, Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics, or AP3. The AP3 platform is engineered to measure compound-specific effects on the entire tumor cell protein signaling network and drug-induced resistance mechanisms in an unbiased manner. These distinctive capabilities enable AP3’s direct application for drug design optimization for monotherapy activity, the identification of rational drug combinations, and the creation of drug-specific proprietary OncoSignature companion diagnostics that are used to identify the patients most likely to benefit from Acrivon’s drug candidates. Acrivon is currently advancing its lead candidate, ACR-368 (also known as prexasertib), a selective small molecule inhibitor targeting CHK1 and CHK2 in a registrational-intent Phase 2b trial across multiple tumor types. The company has received Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the investigation of ACR-368 as monotherapy based on OncoSignature-predicted sensitivity in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian or endometrial cancer. Acrivon’s ACR-368 OncoSignature test, which has not yet obtained regulatory approval, has been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies, including in two separate, blinded, prospectively-designed studies on pretreatment tumor biopsies collected from past third-party Phase 2 trials in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ACR-368. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device designation for the ACR-368 OncoSignature assay for the identification of ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from ACR-368 treatment. The company reported positive clinical data for ovarian and endometrial cancers in April 2024, and in September 2024 it reported additional positive clinical data for endometrial cancer, including a confirmed overall response rate of 62.5% (95% CI, 30.4 - 86.5) and further validation of its prospective OncoSignature selection of patients predicted sensitive to ACR-368 by showing segregation of responders in OncoSignature-positive versus OncoSignature-negative patients (_p = 0.009_). The median duration of treatment was not yet reached, but the duration on study was 6 months at the time of the data cut.\n\nIn addition to ACR-368, Acrivon is also leveraging its proprietary AP3 precision medicine platform for developing its co-crystallography-driven, internally-discovered pipeline programs. These include ACR-2316, the company’s second clinical stage asset, a novel, potent, selective WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor designed for superior single-agent activity through strong activation of not only CDK1 and CDK2, but also of PLK1 to drive pro-apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated in preclinical studies against benchmark inhibitors. In addition, the company has a preclinical cell cycle program with an undisclosed target.\n\nAcrivon has developed AP3 Interactome, a proprietary, computational analytics platform driven by machine learning for integrated comprehensive analyses across all large, in-house AP3 phosphoproteomic drug profiling data sets to advance its in-house research programs.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release includes certain disclosures that contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

(“Acrivon” or “Acrivon Therapeutics”) (Nasdaq: ACRV), a clinical stage precision medicine company utilizing its Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics (AP3) platform for the discovery, design, and development of drug candidates through a mechanistic match to patients whose disease is predicted sensitive to the specific treatment, today announced that the company approved a grant of equity awards under its 2023 Inducement Plan to certain employees. The equity awards were granted in the form of stock options and have a grant date of October 15, 2024.\n\nThe employees received an aggregate of options to purchase 61,950 shares of Acrivon common stock. The stock options will vest 25% on the first anniversary of the first day of the month following the effective date of each such employee’s employment and in additional 2.083% installments on a monthly basis thereafter, subject to each such employee’s continued employment on each vesting date.\n\nThe inducement grants were approved by Acrivon’s Board of Directors, as required by Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4), and were granted as a material inducement to employment in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4).\n\n**About Acrivon Therapeutics** Acrivon is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing precision oncology medicines that it matches to patients whose tumors are predicted to be sensitive to each specific medicine by utilizing Acrivon’s proprietary proteomics-based patient responder identification platform, Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics, or AP3. The AP3 platform is engineered to measure compound-specific effects on the entire tumor cell protein signaling network and drug-induced resistance mechanisms in an unbiased manner. These distinctive capabilities enable AP3’s direct application for drug design optimization for monotherapy activity, the identification of rational drug combinations, and the creation of drug-specific proprietary OncoSignature companion diagnostics that are used to identify the patients most likely to benefit from Acrivon’s drug candidates. Acrivon is currently advancing its lead candidate, ACR-368 (also known as prexasertib), a selective small molecule inhibitor targeting CHK1 and CHK2 in a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial across multiple tumor types. The company has received Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the investigation of ACR-368 as monotherapy based on OncoSignature-predicted sensitivity in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian or endometrial cancer. Acrivon’s ACR-368 OncoSignature test, which has not yet obtained regulatory approval, has been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies, including in two separate, blinded, prospectively-designed studies on pretreatment tumor biopsies collected from past third-party Phase 2 trials in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ACR-368. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device designation for the ACR-368 OncoSignature assay for the identification of ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from ACR-368 treatment. The company reported positive clinical data for ovarian and endometrial cancers in April 2024, and in September 2024 it reported additional positive clinical data for endometrial cancer, including a confirmed overall response rate of 62.5% (95% C.I. 30.4% - 86.5%) and further validation of its prospective OncoSignature selection of patients predicted sensitive to ACR-368 by showing segregation of responders in OncoSignature-positive versus OncoSignature-negative patients (p = 0.009). The median duration of treatment was not yet reached, but the duration on study was 6 months at the time of the data cut.\n\nIn addition to ACR-368, Acrivon is also leveraging its proprietary AP3 precision medicine platform for developing its co-crystallography-driven, internally-discovered pipeline programs. These include ACR-2316, the company’s second clinical stage asset, a potent, selective WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor designed for superior single-agent activity as demonstrated in preclinical studies against benchmark inhibitors. The company is also progressing internally- developed preclinical programs, including a cell cycle program with an undisclosed target.\n\nAcrivon has developed AP3 Interactome, a proprietary, computational analytics platform driven by machine learning for integrated comprehensive analyses across all large, in-house AP3 phosphoproteomic drug profiling data sets to advance its in-house research programs.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release includes certain disclosures that contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

Selinexor, an inhibitor of nuclear export, has shown promising clinical activity for AML. To identify the molecular context for monotherapy sensitivity as well as rational drug combinations, we profile selinexor signaling responses using phosphoproteomics in primary AML patient samples and cell lines. Functional phosphosite scoring reveals that p53 function is required for selinexor sensitivity consistent with enhanced efficacy of selinexor in combination with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a. Moreover, combining selinexor with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 overcomes dysregulated AKT-FOXO3 signaling in resistant cells, resulting in synergistic anti-proliferative effects. Using high-throughput spatial proteomics to profile subcellular compartments, we measure global proteome and phospho-proteome dynamics, providing direct evidence of nuclear translocation of FOXO3 upon combination treatment. Our data demonstrate the potential of phosphoproteomics and functional phosphorylation site scoring to successfully pinpoint key targetable signaling hubs for rational drug combinations.\n\n## Graphical abstract\n\n[![Graphical abstract undfig1](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/d3cef0b9-6d30-45ee-9abd-559a73936cd7/main.assets/fx1.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/ba128c86-ca2e-4915-bc34-9dbf677471df/main.assets/fx1_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\n## Research topic(s)\n\n  1.

The repertoire has expanded into numerous different molecularly defined subtypes ([Papaemmanuil et al., 2016](#bib49)), underscoring the complexity of the genetic landscape. The standard-of-care therapy for AML includes cytotoxic chemotherapy interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis; e.g. cytarabine and anthracyclines ([Rai et al., 1981](#bib52)) for patients fit enough to receive these treatments. Sadly, these treatment regimens have not advanced significantly for decades, and targeted therapies for AML are limited ([Vetrie et al., 2020](#bib72)). Only within the past few years have successful clinical trials and regulatory approvals of targeted therapies for AML advanced the field toward precision oncology ([Daver et al., 2019](#bib18); [Wei and Tiong, 2017](#bib76)). Nevertheless, despite initial response to conventional therapies, the long-term prognosis for AML patients is sub-optimal, with a relapse rate of ∼50% and a 5-year overall survival rate of ∼30% ([Medeiros et al., 2019](#bib42)). A universal challenge in cancer therapy relates to understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of _de novo_ or acquired therapy resistance with the premise of new avenues for targeted therapeutic approaches, including for AML.\n\nSelective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) hold promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance to conventional chemotherapy in AML ([Pardee et al., 2020](#bib50); [Sweet et al., 2020](#bib64); [Talati and Sweet, 2018](#bib65)). The first-in-class SINE compound, selinexor, reversibly binds to and inhibits the nuclear export protein exportin-1 (XPO1), leading to accumulation of cargo proteins in the cell nucleus ([Fung and Chook, 2014](#bib26); [Thakar et al., 2013](#bib66)). These include tumor suppressor proteins; e.g., p53, cell cycle regulators, and targets of chemotherapeutic agents such as topoisomerases ([Alt et al., 2002](#bib2); [Subhash et al., 2018](#bib61); [Turner et al., 2013](#bib68)). XPO1 is overexpressed in AML cells, and increased levels of XPO1 are inversely correlated with overall survival in AML patients ([Kojima et al., 2013](#bib35)). Moreover, in preclinical AML models, selinexor has demonstrated encouraging anti-leukemic effects ([Etchin et al., 2013](#bib24); [Ranganathan et al., 2012](#bib53)), spurring a surge in clinical trial testing of selinexor as single agent or in combination with other therapies in numerous solid and liquid tumor trials, including at least 15 trials in AML ([clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov)). Studies so far indicate limited single-agent activity in AML, while combination therapies with primarily non-targeted agents show some clinical promise ([Bhatnagar et al., 2020](#bib7); [Wang et al., 2018](#bib75)). However, targeted inhibitors of cellular signal transduction pathways provide a hitherto minimally explored potential for combination with selinexor, which is clinically attractive given the potential for an improved therapeutic index compared with chemotherapy combinations.\n\nMass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative phosphoproteomics is a powerful method for global analysis of signaling networks, and the technology has proved valuable in identifying targetable and drug-regulated signaling nodes in various disease models ([Andersen et al., 2010](#bib3); [Emdal et al., 2018](#bib23); [Francavilla et al., 2017](#bib25); [Lescarbeau et al., 2016](#bib40); [Rikova et al., 2007](#bib56)). To uncover clinically actionable, rational drug combinations with selinexor in AML, we performed MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomics analyses of the response to selinexor using _ex vivo_ primary AML patient samples and cell lines. We characterized the phosphorylation events associated with selinexor sensitivity and resistance using functional scoring of phosphosites ([Ochoa et al., 2020](#bib47)), an approach termed phosphoproteomics analysis with functional scoring (PAFS), to identify key signaling nodes of biological importance. Based on PAFS, we found that functional p53 context provides single-agent selinexor sensitivity, which is further enhanced with nutlin-3a, while activated AKT-forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) survival signaling is a key selinexor resistance mechanism that can be overcome by combining selinexor with an AKT inhibitor. Using spatial proteomics, we further demonstrated this mechanism to involve cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of FOXO3 upon the combination therapy, consistent with the release of FOXO3 from cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins upon AKT inhibition.\n\n## Results\n\n### Selinexor response in _ex vivo_ -cultured primary human AML cells\n\nTo characterize the response to selinexor in a patient-derived _ex vivo_ model, we isolated blasts from either bone marrow or peripheral blood from 44 treatment-naive AML patients ([Figure 1](#fig1)A; [Table S1](#mmc2)). The patient samples showed good coverage of different AML subtypes (M0–M5) according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification system ([Bennett et al., 1976](#bib6)), with most samples being either M1 or M4 as expected from a treatment-naive population ([Figure 1](#fig1)B). Moreover, all AML risk groups based on the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 risk stratification model ([Döhner et al., 2017](#bib22)) were represented ([Figure 1](#fig1)C). Hence, we deemed the sample collection to cover an expected spectrum of AML heterogeneity and be reasonably representative of the general population.\n\n[![](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/7fed1ee6-94af-4eab-b037-7eef5053bbdf/main.assets/gr1.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/43987849-c190-4af5-bb63-ae7bb904cd1c/main.assets/gr1_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\nFigure 1 Phosphoproteomics analysis of the selinexor response in AML _ex vivo_ samples\n\n[Show full caption](# \"Expand\")\n\n(A) Schematic representation of the workflow for characterization of the selinexor response in _ex vivo_ -treated AML patient samples (n = 44).\n\n(B and C) Patient distribution in cohort according to the French-American-British (FAB) subtype classification of AML morphology (B) and the European LeukemiaNet 2017 risk stratification model by genetic abnormality (C).\n\n(D) Selinexor EC50 values for the 20 _ex vivo_ AML patient samples in the phosphoproteome analysis with grouping into selinexor responders (EC50 < 1,000 nM; n = 9) and non-responders (EC50 > 1,000 nM; n = 11).

See also [Figures S1–S3](#mmc1); [Tables S1](#mmc2) and [S2](#mmc3).\n\n_Ex vivo_ -cultured patient AML cells were treated with selinexor ([Figure 1](#fig1)A) and, based on cell viability measurements 48 h post treatment, dose-response curves were generated and fitted dose-response models derived from a Hill function ([Figure S1](#mmc1); [Table S1](#mmc2)). The values for half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) were determined for each patient sample and a binary cutoff of 1 μM was chosen to distinguish selinexor responders (EC50 < 1 μM) from non-responders (EC50 > 1 μM) ([Table S1](#mmc2)). Among the 44-patient cohort, we identified 18 (40.9%) responders and 26 (59.1%) non-responders to selinexor treatment based on this cutoff.\n\n### Phosphoproteomics analysis of the selinexor response in _ex vivo_ AML patient samples\n\nTo study the signaling events associated with selinexor response in AML, we performed quantitative MS-based phosphoproteomics profiling of 20 of the 44 patient samples, including nine responders and 11 non-responders (represented in [Figure 1](#fig1)D), for which sufficient protein amounts of 50–100 μg could be isolated. For this subset of samples, AML heterogeneity was evident in terms of subtype classification except for the more differentiated M2 subtype ([Figure 1](#fig1)B) and the prognostic risk groups covered 45% favorable, 40% intermediate, and 15% high-risk patients ([Figure 1](#fig1)C). The selinexor non-responders showed more diversity in terms of FAB classification and risk grouping compared with the responders, which were mainly the more common M1 and M4 subtypes with intermediate/favorable risk groups ([Figure 1](#fig1)E). Prior to phosphoproteomics analysis, an optimal time point for selinexor stimulation was determined by treating sensitive MV-4-11 human AML cells with 1 μM selinexor and monitor the relative phosphorylation of S780-Rb for up to 0.5–8 h. The tumor suppressor Rb is a known, functionally important cargo protein of XPO1, and selinexor treatment has been shown to reduce the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6/cyclin D1-dependent inactivating phosphorylation of Rb ([Baek et al., 2018](#bib4)). We deemed the 6-h time point as optimal based on reduced phosphorylation with limited effect on total Rb levels ([Figure 1](#fig1)F) ([Wang and Liu, 2019](#bib74)). Subsequently, _ex vivo_ -cultured AML cells from each patient were treated with selinexor or DMSO and the samples processed according to a workflow based on tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling for precise quantitation as previously described ([Emdal et al., 2018](#bib23)), and analyzed as outlined in [Figure 1](#fig1)G. From the phosphoproteome analysis, we identified and quantified 15,241 phosphorylated sites, 11,592 of which were localized with high confidence (class I; [Olsen et al., 2006](#bib48)) and covered 3,626 phosphoproteins ([Figures 1](#fig1)H, [S2](#mmc1)A, and S2B; [Table S2](#mmc3)).\n\nTo characterize the global effects of selinexor on the phosphoproteome, TMT reporter ion intensities from each TMT11-plex dataset were normalized using the variance stabilization normalization (VSN) method ([Huber et al., 2002](#bib32)) and batch effect corrected ([Figures S2](#mmc1)C and S2D). We assessed the level of regulation by differential phosphorylation site analysis and, based on the resulting volcano plots ([Figure S2](#mmc1)E), we identified 1,023 downregulated and 994 upregulated by selinexor as well as the regulation of phosphosites in the responders (downregulation, 745; upregulation, 720) and non-responders (downregulation, 221; upregulation, 335). The lower number of regulated phosphorylation sites in the non-responders suggests that selinexor induced weaker effects on the phosphoproteome in patients resistant to selinexor.\n\nOverrepresentation analysis of sequence motifs among the regulated phosphorylation sites in responders and non-responders revealed no major differences between the two groups ([Figure S2](#mmc1)F). However, a strong preference for proline residues in the +1 position to the phosphorylated residue, which is characteristic for proline-directed kinases (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinases [MAPKs] and CDKs), and a preference for the R-X-X-pS/T motif, characteristic for PKA/B/C kinases, was observed irrespective of directionality up or down of phospho-regulation. A high frequency of glutamine (Q) in the +1 position was also observed, specifically for upregulated phosphorylation sites in responder and non-responder groups. This is the preferred consensus motif for DNA damage response (DDR) pathway kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), suggesting increased signaling due to activation of DNA-damage stress responses. Moreover, kinase-substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) ([Figures S3](#mmc1)A–S3D) showed that the CSNK(1/2)A1 substrate motif was enriched in treated non-responders ([Figure S3](#mmc1)C) and the cell cycle regulator WEE1 appeared activated in non-responders compared with responders prior to treatment ([Figure S3](#mmc1)D).\n\nBased on the statistical significance (p values) and directionality (up or down) of the differentially selinexor-regulated phosphorylation sites, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the phosphoproteins. The top enriched gene sets show a clear consensual upregulation of transcription and RNA processing and splicing in both responder and non-responder samples ([Figure S3](#mmc1)E). In the case of top enriched downregulated gene sets, there were both shared sets and some unique sets for responders and non-responders. Among the shared downregulated gene sets are deubiquitinases of the Ub C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) proteinase family; insulin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, a possible indication of early triggered apoptosis (onset of protein degradation and suppression of growth and proliferating signals). JAK-STAT, innate immune system, and B cell receptor signaling are gene sets uniquely downregulated in non-responders, which potentially could be related to resistance mechanisms.\n\n### Genetic annotation of patient samples shows poor correlation with selinexor response\n\nNext-generation genomic sequencing of AML patient samples has revealed major genetic diversity with several driver mutations and distinct molecular subgroups. A comprehensive characterization of the genomic landscape in AML was previously described ([Papaemmanuil et al., 2016](#bib49)). To explore whether response to selinexor correlated with specific genomic subtypes, we performed a basic computational analysis of the reported genomic aberrations, including FLT3 status and WT1 expression. Comparing the overlap between samples of different genetic annotations and their response to selinexor using the Szymkiewicz-Simpson index or overlapping coefficient, we found limited correlation between FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) as well as mutations in NPM1 (types A and G) with lack of response to selinexor ([Figure S3](#mmc1)F). However, this correlation was not exclusive and therefore non-conclusive. In conclusion, we did not observe a clear and distinct correlation between known genomic aberrations in the established genomic AML subtypes and sensitivity to selinexor.\n\n### Functional scoring of phosphorylation sites identifies key signaling rewiring\n\nTo pinpoint the most biologically relevant phosphorylation sites within the regulated phosphoproteome ([Figure S2](#mmc1)E), and, thus, key players in the pharmacodynamic and adaptive response to selinexor, we applied functional scoring with PAFS ([Ochoa et al., 2020](#bib47)) to each significantly drug-regulated phosphorylation site among the responders and non-responders. In the work by Ochoa et al., the functional scoring is based on a machine learning (ML) approach applied to 112 large-scale public phosphoproteome datasets from the PRIDE database. Here, integration of prior knowledge from experimental data, prediction tools, and MS signal properties was used to generate a functional score (between 0 and 1), which allowed the ranking of phosphosites according to biological relevance ([Ochoa et al., 2020](#bib47)). [Figure 2](#fig2)A lists the top-scoring (score > 0.6) phosphorylation sites significantly regulated by selinexor in responders (down, 83; up, 76) and non-responders (down, 31; up, 41) with minimal overlap between groups ([Figure S4](#mmc1)A). The top five downregulated sites scored in responders were the transcriptional repressor MAF1 S68, stathmin 1 (STMN1) S16, the transcription factor Jun S63 and S73, and protein kinase C theta (PRKCQ) T538. Conversely, the top five downregulated sites scored in non-responders were cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit α/β/γ (PRKACA, PRKACB, PRKACG) T198, SRC family kinase LYN/HCK Y397/Y411, ZFP36L1/L2 S334/S490, the translation initiation factor EIF4B S422, and splicing factor SRSF9 S211 ([Figure 2](#fig2)A). The highest-scored upregulated sites in responders include the transcription factor heat shock factor (HSF1) S303, the tumor suppressor p53 S315, and its E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 S166. Phosphorylation of the p53 site provides a docking motif for PIN1, which regulates p53 stability and transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage ([Liu et al., 2019](#bib84); [Wulf et al., 2002](#bib80)). These findings suggest that p53 enhancement could potentiate the activity of selinexor.\n\n[![](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/ba4b7a19-3ca1-4140-95c6-5d594a46044e/main.assets/gr2.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/58b36d6e-d939-49dc-883b-49878fbb5a1d/main.assets/gr2_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\nFigure 2 Functional scoring of phosphorylation sites identifies key signaling rewiring in response to selinexor\n\n[Show full caption](# \"Expand\")\n\n(A) Overview of the functional sites assigned to phosphorylation sites identified to be down- (left) or upregulated (right) among responders and non-responders in response to selinexor treatment.

Significance was deemed based on a two-sided t test (FDR < 0.05, s0 = 0.1) using Perseus software and highlighted in orange coloring. Red and blue coloring indicate the proteins with regulated phosphosites shown in (A). See also [Figures S4](#mmc1) and [S5](#mmc1); [Tables S2](#mmc3) and [S3](#mmc4).\n\nIn contrast, the highest scoring site in non-responders was FOXO3 S253 ([Figure 2](#fig2)A) and phosphorylation of this site by AKT has been shown to retain FOXO3 sequestrated in the cytoplasm through binding with 14-3-3 and thus preventing its translocation to the nucleus where it exerts pro-apoptotic transcriptional effects ([Brunet et al., 1999](#bib85)). Hence, activation of AKT-FOXO3 survival signaling may serve as a biologically important consequence of selinexor treatment in non-responders. In addition to the FOXO signaling pathway, several components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (e.g., RPS6K2, RPS6, EIF4B, CLIP1) received high functional scores indicating regulation by AKT signaling ([Figure 2](#fig2)A). A heatmap display of all regulated phosphorylation sites from proteins assigned to either mTOR or FOXO signaling pathway revealed a high degree of inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity, underscoring the great complexity of drug-regulated pathways ([Figure S4](#mmc1)B). However, based on our functional phosphosite scoring analysis, we could pinpoint AKT as a kinase with key activity in selinexor-resistant AML cells, immediately generating the testable hypothesis that AKT inhibition with selinexor would, at least partially, overcome this resistance.\n\nTo determine whether the observed phosphoproteome effects were associated with proteome changes or true regulation at the phosphorylation-site level, we measured a single-shot proteome (± selinexor treatment; 1 μM, 6 h) for 30 _ex vivo_ samples with known selinexor response ([Figures S4](#mmc1)C and [S5](#mmc1); [Table S3](#mmc4)). We identified and quantified 5,917 proteins ([Figure 2](#fig2)B; [Table S3](#mmc4)) and found that none of the phosphoproteins in responders and non-responders highlighted in [Figure 2](#fig2)A showed significant changes at the proteome level ([Figures 2](#fig2)C and 2D). Hence, the observed phosphoproteome changes highlighted in [Figure 2](#fig2)A were truly due to stoichiometric regulation at the phospho-site level. Limited differences were observed between responders and non-responders at the pre-treatment and post-treatment proteome level ([Figures S4](#mmc1)D and S4E), while proteome abundance of proteins related to mTOR and FOXO signaling confirmed a high degree of inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity at the proteome level, too ([Figure S4](#mmc1)F).\n\n### Phosphoproteomics analysis of selinexor response in sensitive and resistant AML cell lines\n\nPrior to testing our _ex vivo_ -derived hypothesis that dual AKT and XPO1 inhibition in AML cell lines would abrogate selinexor resistance, we initially wanted to confirm the global phosphoproteome findings and subsequently screened a panel of nine AML cell lines for selinexor sensitivity and subjected them to the PAFS analytical approach as well. GDM-1 and MV-4-11 were selected as selinexor sensitive, while NOMO-1 and PL-21 were selected as resistant, based on dose-response curves and calculated EC50 values ([Figure 3](#fig3)A). A higher expression of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) after selinexor treatment in GDM-1 and MV-4-11, compared with NOMO-1 and PL-21, further substantiated that the increased selinexor sensitivity in GDM-1 and MV-4-11 cell lines was consistent with drug-induced apoptosis ([Figure 3](#fig3)B). We then analyzed the phosphoproteome after 6 h of selinexor treatment of these four cell lines as outlined in [Figure 3](#fig3)C. We identified and quantified 26,428 phosphorylated sites, 21,921 of which were confidently localized to serine (85.8% of the total or 14,329 unique sites), threonine (12.5% or 2,080 unique sites), or tyrosine (1.7% or 289 unique sites) residues in the peptide sequence (class I) within 4,222 proteins with a good protein overlap of 50% between cell lines ([Figures 3](#fig3)D and 3E; [Table S4](#mmc5)). TMT intensities from each of the four TMT sets were normalized and batch effect corrected as described above ([Figure S6](#mmc1)B). The level of selinexor-regulated sites in each cell line was determined by differential analysis as shown in the volcano plots ([Figure 3](#fig3)F). In GDM-1, 1,851 sites were downregulated, and 1,341 sites were upregulated. In MV-4-11, 1,037 sites were downregulated, and 587 were upregulated. In PL-21, 1,231 sites were downregulated and 1,357 were upregulated. In NOMO-1, 271 sites were downregulated and 148 were upregulated.\n\n[![](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/353c7485-e46e-47e3-b0c6-a4974ba12903/main.assets/gr3.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/7875d171-6b30-4bf6-92a3-8fd0e598eba2/main.assets/gr3_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\nFigure 3 Phosphoproteomics analysis of the selinexor response in sensitive and resistant AML cell lines\n\n[Show full caption](# \"Expand\")\n\n(A) Dose-response cell viability curves for a panel of AML cell lines treated with selinexor or DMSO as control and estimated relative and absolute EC50 values for each of the cell lines (n = 2–3 independent experiments; n = 4 technical replicates each dose).\n\n(B) Lysates from AML cells treated with selinexor or DMSO for 24 h, immunoblotted for cleaved PARP and actin (for reference) (upper) and quantified (lower).

See also [Figure S6](#mmc1); [Table S4](#mmc5).\n\nSequence motif overrepresentation for each cell line showed a strong preference for proline residues in the +1 position to the phosphorylated residue and a preference for the R-X-X-pS/T motif among the regulated phosphorylation sites ([Figure S6](#mmc1)C), consistent with the findings observed in the AML _ex vivo_ model ([Figure S2](#mmc1)F). The preference for Q in the +1 position of the phosphosite was only observed in the MV-4-11 cell line, pointing toward potential differences in the DNA-damage response pathway activity between _in vitro_ and _ex vivo_ -cultured cells, possibly ascribable to the differences in handling prior to treatment, cell culture media differences, or adaptive changes in cell lines grown in long-term culture ([Cucchi et al., 2020](#bib17)). The resistant PL-21 cells showed a preference for glutamic acid (E) in the +3 position among upregulated phosphorylation sites as also observed for non-responders in the AML _ex vivo_ model. The KSEA revealed a shared core of RPS6KA/B kinase substrates downregulated by selinexor ([Figures 3](#fig3)G and 3H) in all groups, which supports the PAFS approach identifying key functional phosphorylation sites of the mTOR signaling pathway; e.g., RPS6 and RPS6K in the _ex vivo_ model ([Figure 2](#fig2)A).\n\nThe GSEA of the selinexor-treated cell lines ([Figures S6](#mmc1)D–S6E) showed downregulation of cell cycle-related processes, specifically G1 phase-related in agreement with the _ex vivo_ model. While processes related to RNA processing were commonly upregulated in the patient-derived samples, some of these gene sets were found to be downregulated in MV-4-11 cells. In the resistant PL-21 cells, several upregulated pathways were related to autophagy, which could potentially be related to selinexor resistance ([Zhang et al., 2016](#bib82)). Furthermore, shared upregulated gene sets were related to immune response and viral infection processes.\n\n### Functional scoring of selinexor-regulated phosphosites in AML cell lines recapitulates the diversity in selinexor response\n\nNext, we compared the selinexor-regulated phosphoproteome from the primary _ex vivo_ models with the established cell line models. Of note, approximately half of the drug-regulated phosphosites (45%–53%) regulated in the _ex vivo_ model were also regulated in the cell line models ([Figure S7](#mmc1)A). Overall, we were able to detect a significantly larger number of regulated phosphosites in cell lines than in the _ex vivo_ model. We and others have observed similar discrepancies in studies comparing cell lines with patient samples, which likely reflects the availability of more total protein from cell lines and the potential impact of cell-line-specific adaptation to growth in 2D. In an attempt to uncover the most important pathways that were regulated in a similar manner in both models, we performed PAFS on the regulated phosphoproteome of cell lines and ranked the highest scoring (>0.6) functional phosphorylation sites shared with the _ex vivo_ models ([Figure 4](#fig4)A). A few phosphosites were downregulated by drug treatment irrespective of response group; e.g., S199 of HNRNPA1, a protein involved in processing and transport of mRNA reported to functionally interact with XPO1 ([la Cour et al., 2004](#bib37)). Accordingly, S199 phosphorylation is a potentially attractive pharmacodynamic drug target engagement biomarker for selinexor. Conversely, the HSF1 S303 site was upregulated by drug treatment in both response groups. Of note, the majority of listed functional sites were regulated oppositely by selinexor in sensitive and resistant cells. In _ex vivo_ responders/sensitive cell lines, the sites of JUN S73, PEA15 S104, PTPN6 Y564, and RPS6 S235/236 with roles in apoptosis, signaling, and cell growth were downregulated, which is consistent with a drug response affecting cell viability. Among the upregulated sites in responders/sensitive cells, we observed a high functional score for p53 S315. In non-responders/resistant cells, we observed downregulation of EIF4B S422 phosphorylation, a known phosphorylation site convergently targeted by several signaling cascades involved in tumorigenesis, including the core PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling axis ([Chen et al., 2016](#bib13); [Raught et al., 2004](#bib54); [Shahbazian et al., 2006](#bib59)). Interestingly, the phosphorylation site upregulated with the highest scoring in non-responders/resistant cells is FOXO3 S253, a key inhibitory site that may suggest inhibition of apoptosis as a key resistance mechanism in cell lines as well as patient samples. These data suggest the potential for dual AKT and XPO1 inhibition to overcome selinexor resistance.\n\n[![](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/e3d5a216-b2fe-40e1-aab4-fcbe8c8befb5/main.assets/gr4.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/4cff37d2-7a33-44d3-9845-a91e1b9aeb59/main.assets/gr4_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\nFigure 4 The selinexor responses in the AML _ex vivo_ model and cell lines show common and unique signaling responses\n\n[Show full caption](# \"Expand\")\n\n(A) List of phosphorylation sites with a functional score >0.6 commonly regulated between _ex vivo_ analysis and AML cell lines.

We identified and quantified 4,765 proteins ([Figure S7](#mmc1)B) and showed, among the 504 differentially expressed proteins (ANOVA significant; FDR = 0.01), overrepresentation of proteins related to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms ribosome biogenesis and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis among sensitive cells and lysosome and phagosome overrepresentation for resistant cells ([Figure 4](#fig4)B). Abundance heterogeneity was evident for the top five most regulated proteins in [Figure 4](#fig4)A, and a trend of higher levels of proteins related to mTOR and FOXO3 signaling was observed for sensitive cells ([Figure 4](#fig4)C). We further examined the relative levels of AKT, FOXO3, and p53 across the four cell lines by western blotting ([Figure 4](#fig4)D). In contrast to the functional correlation between phosphorylation status of these proteins and selinexor sensitivity, there was no correlation between pan protein levels of AKT and FOXO3 and selinexor sensitivity, while increased level of pan p53 correlated with selinexor sensitivity independently of _TP53_ mutational status (wild-type _TP53_ , GMD-1, MV-4-11, PL-21; and mutated _TP53_ , NOMO-1) ([de Andrade et al., 2022](#bib20); [Sugimoto et al., 1992](#bib63)).\n\n### The MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a enhances selinexor sensitivity in p53 wild-type-expressing sensitive cells\n\nGiven the upregulation by selinexor and high functional score for p53 S315 in responders/sensitive cells, we hypothesized that functional p53 context might be required for selinexor sensitivity. Accordingly, we examined the benefit of combination with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a, which is known to stabilize and enhance p53 function ([Lavin and Gueven, 2006](#bib39)). We found that only the sensitive cell lines with wild-type p53 expression ([Figure 4](#fig4)D) responded to increasing doses of nutlin-3a with decreased cell viability after 72 h ([Figure S8](#mmc1)A), consistent with increased levels of p53 and its downstream effector p21 ([Figure S8](#mmc1)B). Moreover, in the selinexor-sensitive MV-4-11 cell line, combination treatment with selinexor demonstrated synergistic effect on cell viability 72 h post treatment at higher nutlin-3a concentrations ([Figures 5](#fig5)A and 5B), in line with functional p53 being expressed at high levels, while there was no effect of the nutlin-3a combination in the p53 non-expressing PL-21 cells. Moreover, the synergistic effect in MV-4-11 cells was consistent with increased cleaved caspase-3 levels, which was also seen in the p53-expressing selinexor-sensitive GDM-1 cells ([Figures S8](#mmc1)C and S8D). These findings support the notion that functional p53 context provides for selinexor monotherapy sensitivity, which can be further enhanced with nutlin-3a.\n\n[![](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/8509b5a4-f21e-4375-9ee7-bff701774a93/main.assets/gr5.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/0210af52-7332-4d8e-b046-513c1fb39a52/main.assets/gr5_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\nFigure 5 Selinexor combination therapy with MDM2 or AKT inhibition shows synergistic effects\n\n[Show full caption](# \"Expand\")\n\n(A) 3D plots showing the mean relative cell viability (color scale, z axis) against selinexor and nutlin-3a doses (x and y axes) for AML cells treated with the drugs alone or in combination (n = 2–3 independent experiments; n = 4 technical replicates each dose).\n\n(B) Heatmaps showing the synergy scores derived for experiments in (A).\n\n(C) 3D plots showing mean relative cell viability (color scale, z axis) against selinexor and MK-2206 doses (x and y axes) for NOMO-1 and PL-21 cells treated with the drugs alone or in combination (n = 2–3 independent experiments; n = 4 technical replicates each dose).\n\n(D) Heatmaps showing the synergy scores for the different cell lines and drug combinations.\n\n(E) Calculated EC50 values for selinexor plotted for each dose of MK-2206 for each AML cell line as indicated.\n\n(F) Western blot (left) and quantification (right) of lysates from PL-21 cells treated with selinexor, MK-2206 alone, or the combination for 24 h and immunoblotted for cleaved PARP and β-actin (for reference).

To test this, we assessed the combination of selinexor with the selective, allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 ([Hirai et al., 2010](#bib29); [Klaeger et al., 2017](#bib34); [Wiechmann et al., 2021](#bib77)). Sensitive and resistant AML cell lines were treated with increasing doses of selinexor alone or in combination with MK-2206, followed by cell viability measurements after 72 h ([Figures 5](#fig5)C and [S8](#mmc1)E). As expected, the combination treatment with MK-2206 led to inhibition of phosphorylation of FOXO3 S253 and also confirmed AKT inhibition in GDM-1 and PL-21 cells ([Figures S8](#mmc1)F and S8G). Drug synergy scores were computed ([Figure 5](#fig5)D) and all cell lines generally showed good synergy for selinexor doses ranging from 4.6 nM to 41.2 nM with MK-2206 doses between 333.3 and 1,666.6 nM. EC50 of selinexor for the different MK-2206 doses tested was computed for all four AML cell lines ([Figure 5](#fig5)E). As suggested by the synergy scores, selinexor potency in resistant cell lines reached that of sensitive cells for MK-2206 dose levels of 333.3 nM and higher. Consistent with these effects, the combination of selinexor and MK-2206 resulted in increased PARP cleavage compared with single-agent treatments in the selinexor-resistant PL-21 cells ([Figure 5](#fig5)F). These findings demonstrate the ability of AKT inhibition in combination with selinexor to overcome FOXO3-mediated selinexor resistance ([Figure 5](#fig5)G).\n\n### Spatial proteomics confirms nuclear FOXO3 translocation in PL-21 cells treated with selinexor in combination with MK-2206\n\nGiven that selinexor inhibits XPO1 and consequently affects the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of proteins including FOXO3 upon dephosphorylation of S253, we applied a recent in-house-developed spatial proteomics workflow for studying subcellular phospho-signaling dynamics ([Martinez-Val et al., 2021](#bib41)). We profiled six different subcellular fractions representing the cellular compartments of the cytosol, membrane-bound organelles and nucleus in MV-4-11 and PL-21 cells after treatment with DMSO, selinexor, MK-2206, or the combination quantifying 6,703 proteins and 36,818 confidently localized phosphorylation sites (class I; [Olsen et al., 2006](#bib48)) ([Figures 6](#fig6)A and [S9](#mmc1)A–S9E; [Tables S5](#mmc6) and [S6](#mmc7)). Hierarchical clustering analysis of the scaled fractional protein and phosphorylation site intensities in the DMSO treatment group showed well-defined clusters ([Figures 6](#fig6)B and [S9](#mmc1)F) that captured a distinct part of the cellular (phospho)proteome of MV-4-11 and PL-21 cells, as indicated by overrepresentation of the indicated ML-based DeepLoc terms ([Almagro Armenteros et al., 2017](#bib1)). We tracked the dynamics of a selection of known XPO1 cargo proteins ([Wang and Liu, 2019](#bib74)) and found, consistent with our western blotting experiments, that p53 was only detected in MV-4-11 cells ([Figure S10](#mmc1)A). It showed the highest intensity increase upon selinexor treatment in fraction 2 (DeepLoc: nuclear) supporting translocation to the nuclear compartment ([Figure 6](#fig6)B). Moreover, global analysis of the selinexor-induced changes in fraction 2 ([Figure 6](#fig6)C) showed a significant increase of well-known XPO1 cargo proteins, such as RB1, NPM1, PIK3R1, and FOXO3, in the sensitive MV-4-11 cells, with a concomitant trend for cytoplasmic depletion of FOXO3 and RB1 ([Figures 6](#fig6)D and 6E). In contrast, no significant change was observed for these proteins in resistant PL-21 cells ([Figure S10](#mmc1)B). However, upon combination with MK-2206, FOXO3 showed translocation to the nucleus with concomitant cytoplasmic depletion in the resistant PL-21 cells ([Figures 6](#fig6)F–6H and [S10](#mmc1)C). Moreover, MK-2206 treatment alone showed FOXO3 accumulation in the nucleus of MV-4-11 cells and not PL-21 ([Figures 6](#fig6)E, [S10](#mmc1)D, and S10E), suggesting that selinexor is required for the accumulation of FOXO3 in the nuclear compartment in resistant cells. KEGG terms related to spliceosome and RNA transport were significantly overrepresented among the proteins translocating to the nucleus in MV-4-11 cells upon selinexor treatment ([Figure 6](#fig6)I). By contrast, terms related to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosome, and phagosome characterized the combination effect of proteins translocating to the nucleus in PL-21 cells, including pathways related to RIG-I-like receptor and phosphatidylinositol signaling, with the latter suggesting AKT inhibition to facilitate the translocation of components of its own pathway to the nucleus ([Figure 6](#fig6)J).\n\n[![](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/271674ed-adb9-4611-9e5f-0a9df98871f2/main.assets/gr6.jpg)](/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111177/asset/989e4267-a8b4-40f7-9baa-9a58eba01fa4/main.assets/gr6_lrg.jpg \"View full size image in a new tab\")\n\nFigure 6 Subcellular proteome analysis of selinexor synergy combination with MK-2206 confirms FOXO3 nuclear translocation in PL-21 cells\n\n[Show full caption](# \"Expand\")\n\n(A) Brief overview of the spatial-proteomics workflow and summary of results.\n\n(B) Heatmap of scaled intensities per fraction of the subcellular proteome of MV-4-11 (left) and PL-21 (right) cells (DMSO-treated cells; n = 4 independent experiments), showing protein and sample clustering.\n\n(C and D) Volcano plots showing differentially regulated proteins in the subcellular proteome analysis of fraction 2 (C) and 1 (D) of MV-4-11 cells.

See also [Figures S9–S11](#mmc1); [Tables S5](#mmc6) and [S6](#mmc7).\n\nIn the subcellular phosphoproteome, differential phosphorylation site analysis of the selinexor response in MV-4-11 cells showed upregulation of phosphorylated ATM/ATR substrates, while p70S6K/mTOR substrates and key activation sites on MAPK1/3 (ERK) were downregulated in the cytoplasmic compartment by selinexor ([Figure S11](#mmc1)A). Sequence motif analysis showed an overrepresentation of Q in +1 of the phosphorylation site, supporting active DNA-damage signaling by ATM/ATR among the selinexor-upregulated sites. Moreover, proline-directed phosphorylation sites with P in +1 were overrepresented among selinexor-downregulated sites and aligned well with the observed reduced activity of MAPK1/3 in the cytoplasmic compartment ([Figures S11](#mmc1)A and S11B). Of note, consistent with the downregulation of p70S6K/mTOR substrates, we observed a significant upregulation of PIK3R1 in fraction 2 of the proteome data and a trend for upregulation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDPK1) in fraction 6 (DeepLoc: nucleus) ([Figure 6](#fig6)C; [Table S5](#mmc6); fraction 6). This suggests that limited AKT activation can take place in the cytoplasm due to spatial constraint of AKT upstream kinases to the nuclear compartment. Relating this to the _ex vivo_ model, we find that, among the top five highest functional scoring and downregulated phosphorylation sites ([Figure 2](#fig2)A) for responders, the regulation of four sites fit well with our observations. First, both sites on Jun (S63 and S73; known MAPK3/ERK1 and CDK3 sites) (PhosphoSitePlus; [Hornbeck et al., 2015](#bib31)) are downregulated and can be explained by the observed MAPK1/3 inhibition ([Figure S11](#mmc1)A) in MV-4-11 cells. Second, the MAF1 site (S68) comprises a direct site phosphorylated by mTOR ([Michels et al., 2010](#bib43)), supporting our findings that sites on mTOR signaling proteins are significantly downregulated ([Figure S11](#mmc1)A). Finally, PRKCQ T538 (in the kinase activation loop) is phosphorylated by PDPK1 ([Sparatore et al., 2003](#bib60)), and hence potentially downregulated as a consequence of PDPK1 nuclear retention.\n\nIn contrast, for resistant PL-21 cells, we observed that only synergistic treatment combination resulted in regulation of ATM/ATR and p70S6K substrates, and mTOR signaling mimicking the selinexor single-treatment response in MV-4-11 cells ([Figures S11](#mmc1)A, S11C, and S11D). For PL-21 cells, AKT2 was significantly increased in nuclear fraction 5 upon combination treatment, suggesting a dual mechanism for the downregulation of p70S6K substrates/mTOR signaling, including the inhibition of AKT by MK-2206 and the nuclear retention of AKT2 away from its downstream targets ([Table S5](#mmc6); fraction 5). Interestingly, the mTOR S2454 autophosphorylation site was upregulated by selinexor monotherapy, while it was downregulated together with mTOR S2448 (a known AKT/p70S6K target site) by the drug combination, supporting the model proposed in [Figure 5](#fig5)G. Finally, in fraction 2, representing the nuclear compartment, we detected multiple upregulated phosphorylation sites on p53 and FOXO3 for MV-4-11 upon selinexor single treatment, while the upregulation of multiple FOXO3 phosphorylation sites was only seen in PL-21 cells upon treatment with the drug combination ([Figures S11](#mmc1)E and S11F).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThere is a significant need for improved treatment options for AML. The results presented in the current study uncover several clinically actionable, molecular contexts predicting sensitivity to both single-agent selinexor as well as to rational combination therapy with selinexor in a subset of AML, in particular the M1 and M4 subgroups, not deducible through genetic characterization. First, we clearly demonstrate that activated AKT-FOXO3 signaling is a key resistance mechanism to selinexor, which can be overcome by combining selinexor with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206. Our findings also show that functional p53 tumor suppressor activity is a requirement for selinexor single-agent activity in AML and that combination therapy with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a leads to elevated p53 levels and synergistic cell killing. These findings support additional testable hypotheses that combinations with other MDM2 inhibitors or inhibitors of MYC signaling, such as a bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor (BETi), might synergize with selinexor in AML and other tumor types with functional p53 through alleviation of suppression of p53 activity. Despite a limited sample size, our phosphoproteome analysis covers a significant fraction of intermediate and high-risk patients with unmet therapeutic needs. Our functional approach is inherently agnostic to underlying genetic alterations and hence offers an alternative approach for rational therapeutic intervention to improve patient outcomes. It remains to be seen in larger cohorts whether the findings of this study associate with specific AML subgroups and specific genetic abnormalities in AML.\n\nA key finding in the current study is the significant selinexor-induced upregulation of p53 S315 phosphorylation in responder AML patient samples and the sensitive AML cell lines ([Figures 2](#fig2)A and [4](#fig4)A). This phosphorylated site binds the prolyl isomerase PIN1 in the nucleus, leading to transcriptional activation of wild-type p53 ([Wulf et al., 2002](#bib80); [Zacchi et al., 2002](#bib81); [Zheng et al., 2002](#bib83)). Consistent with this, a p53 S315A mutant allele is less transcriptionally active than wild-type p53 ([Ito et al., 2001](#bib33)). The significance of this finding is further substantiated by a concomitant upregulated phosphorylation of S166 in MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, in responder AML patient samples. A majority of AML cases contain wild-type _TP53_ , and only 8% of _de novo_ AML cases contain _TP53_ mutations according to TCGA. However, p53 is often rendered functionally deficient by over-expression of MDM2 ([Latif et al., 2021](#bib38)). Selinexor blocks nuclear export and traps both proteins in the nucleus, thus hindering the MDM2-dependent shuttling of MDM2-p53 targeted for cytoplasmic degradation and hence induces transcriptional upregulation through phosphorylation of these sites ([O'Keefe et al., 2003](#bib46)). These findings suggest that selinexor single-agent activity in AML is dependent, at least in part, on minimally one functional _TP53_ allele ([Nishida et al., 2019](#bib45)), as shown for other tumor types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and gastric cancer ([Deng et al., 2020](#bib21); [Subhash et al., 2018](#bib61)).\n\nAnother major finding in this study is the acute upregulation of FOXO3 S253 phosphorylation in the non-responding subset of AML samples, consistent with dysregulated AKT signaling. This is clinically actionable, proposing that the selective, potent AKT inhibitor MK-2206 is a rational drug combination for treatment of AML to overcome selinexor resistance. The importance of the core PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in AML is underscored by its amplification in at least 60%–80% of AML patient blasts ([Herschbein and Liesveld, 2018](#bib28)). Despite preclinical evidence supporting a beneficial effect of rapamycin and MK-2206 monotherapy in AML cells, clinical results have been disappointing ([Boehm et al., 2009](#bib8); [Callera et al., 2008](#bib11); [Konopleva et al., 2014](#bib36); [Recher et al., 2005](#bib55)). This may relate to cellular pathway crosstalk, perturbation of negative feedback loops, as well as co-existing constitutive pathways supporting growth and survival ([Herschbein and Liesveld, 2018](#bib28)). Moreover, subsets of AML patients display varying degrees of network plasticity defining _in vivo_ susceptibility to PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibition, which has been shown to be most effective in patients with low levels of constitutive signaling ([Nepstad et al., 2018](#bib44)). The mTOR protein functions as part of two major protein complexes; mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTORC1 complex directly phosphorylates the RSK p70S6 kinase and the translational repressor 4E-BP1 involved in mRNA translation, resulting in cell growth, whereas mTORC2 directly phosphorylates AKT S473, resulting in its activation and resistance to apoptosis ([Gentzler et al., 2012](#bib27); [Herschbein and Liesveld, 2018](#bib28)). Our data suggest a differential dependency on and central role of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis in responder and non-responder AML blasts, resulting in a differential sensitivity to selinexor monotherapy. First, in sensitive cells, we observe that selinexor traps the AKT upstream kinases PIK3R1 and PDPK1 in the nucleus, thereby limiting their access to activation of cytoplasmic AKT, consistent with the observed downregulation of p70SK6/mTOR substrates and FOXO3 nuclear translocation. PIK3R1 and PDPK1 can localize to the nucleus and serve as XPO1 cargo ([Davis et al., 2015](#bib19); [Sephton et al., 2009](#bib58); [Wang and Liu, 2019](#bib74)). Although this regulation by selinexor seems lost in the resistant cells, it offers the unique opportunity to exploit the observed acute selinexor-induced upregulated AKT signaling through mTOR ([Figure S11](#mmc1)C; upregulated mTOR_S2454 autophosphorylation site) and reflected in high level of FOXO3 S253 phosphorylation as shown in the _ex vivo_ non-responders and the resistant PL-21 cells ([Figures S2](#mmc1)E and [3](#fig3)F). Importantly, we demonstrate that, when AKT signaling is targeted by MK-2206 in combination with selinexor, we observe nuclear translocation of FOXO3 ([Figure 6](#fig6)F), which is not evident upon MK-2206 treatment alone ([Figure S10](#mmc1)E).\n\nThe success of new drug candidates and combination therapies depends on rational clinical trial design and proper patient selection. In this study, we have identified molecular context of p53 for selinexor single-agent activity in AML consistent with enhanced efficacy of selinexor in combination with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a. Moreover, we identify dysregulated AKT-FOXO3 signaling as a key resistance mechanism in selinexor-resistant cells and, accordingly, that the rational combination with MK-2206 overcomes this resistance, as shown in non-responders using _ex vivo_ -treated patient-derived AML samples and in AML cell lines. Importantly, only a subset of non-responders showed increased AKT signaling and FOXO3 S253 phosphorylation, pinpointing the importance of predictive biomarker identification for patient responsiveness. Our data demonstrate a mechanistically comprehensive, functional basis for synergy of AKT inhibition with selinexor to overcome selinexor resistance that might be clinically relevant in a subset of AML patients. Future studies will illuminate how generalizable these findings are in the clinical setting.\n\nIn summary, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of the phosphoproteome changes associated with selinexor treatment in _ex vivo_ AML blasts from patients and AML cell lines, including subcellular proteome dynamics for the latter. We demonstrate the potential of our PAFS approach to identify clinically actionable network nodes from the phosphoproteome data and target these in rational combinations to overcome drug resistances that are not possible to deduce through genetic analyses.\n\n### Limitations of the study\n\nIn the current study, we highlight three main limitations. First, given the high degree of AML heterogeneity, the sample size of our current study presents insufficient power to uncover strong subtype-specific responses to treatment. Second, despite the known advantage of using TMT for peptide labeling due to its low index of missing values within a single TMT batch, the comparison across multiple batches is challenging. The analysis of larger cohorts including treatment conditions poses the risk of inflating the number of missing values as multiple batches are integrated. Third, our PAFS approach holds an inherent bias in assigning higher scores for well-studied phosphorylation sites. Thus, less well-studied phosphorylation sites may, despite lower functional scores, still be of key biological importance when regulated in any given setup.\n\nNote that our findings of the therapeutically actionable enhancing effects of MDM2 and AKT inhibition with selinexor, have just been reported (PMID: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785714/> and PMID: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35668193/>, respectively).\n\n## STAR★Methods\n\n### Key resources table\n\nREAGENT or RESOURCE| SOURCE| IDENTIFIER  \n---|---|---  \n**Antibodies**  \nAnti-β-Actin| Santa Cruz| Cat# sc-47778;

These studies were conducted in accordance with recognized ethical guidelines from the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by an institutional review board. The _ex vivo_ AML model included 44 patients in the age range 20–84 years (21 males, 23 females) with the characteristics as described in [Table S1](#mmc2).\n\n#### _Ex vivo_ AML cell culture\n\nSamples were quickly thawed by swirling the frozen vial in a 37°C water bath. Cells were transferred to a sterile 15 mL falcon tube followed by addition of 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (Corning, Glutagro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL and 100 μg/mL, HyClone, GE Healthcare). Cells were centrifuged at 300G for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the tube was gently tapped to loosen the pellet. Cells were then gently resuspended in 900 μL medium followed by dropwise addition of 100 μL of 1 mg/mL DNase (STEMCELL Technologies) for a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL DNase. Cells were incubated with DNase at RT for 15 min. Treatment was stopped by adding 10 mL of medium followed by centrifugation as above. Cells were resuspended in medium supplemented with the following growth factors and cytokines; TPO 50 ng/mL (Peprotech), Flt-3 50 ng/mL (ORF Genetics, Iceland), SCF 25 ng/mL (ORF Genetics), IL-3 10 ng/mL (ORF Genetics), IL-6 10 ng/mL (Peprotech), GM-CSF 10 ng/mL (ORF Genetics), G-CSF 10 ng/mL (ORF Genetics) EPO 10 ng/mL (Peprotech). Total number and percentage of viable cells was determined using trypan blue staining and an automated cell counter (Countess™, Invitrogen). Primary cells were immediately used in subsequent experiments.\n\n#### AML cell lines\n\nThe human AML cell lines GDM-1, PL-21, NOMO-1, MV-4-11, SKM-1, THP-1, KG-1, and MOLM-13 were obtained from DSMZ and cultured in RPMI 1640 including 2 mM L-glutamine (Corning), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL and 100 μg/mL; Gibco). Cell lines were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2.\n\n### Method details\n\n#### Reagents\n\nSelinexor (KPT-330) was provided by Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. and MK-2206 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Nutlin-3a was purchased from MedChemExpress. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and the final concentration of DMSO was kept at maximum 0.02% (v/v) during cell culture treatment.\n\n#### Cell viability assay\n\nCells were seeded in 384 well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well in 25 μL medium. Drug treatment was performed 2 hours post-thawing by adding increasing doses of drug from a 3-fold dilution series to test 11 different concentrations. Each dose was added in four replicate wells, and the plate was incubated at 37°C. Following selinexor treatment, cell viability was assessed 48 h post-drug treatment by adding PrestoBlue reagent (ThermoFisher) and measuring fluorescence using a SpectraMax i3 multi-mode plate reader (Molecular Devices). Following nutlin-3a treatment, cell viability was assessed 72 h post treatment by adding Cell Titer Glo 2.0 (Promega) and measuring luminescence in a SpectraMax i3 multi-mode plate reader. For drug combinations of selinexor and MK-2206, or selinexor and nutlin-3a, cells were seeded in 384-well plates followed by drug treatment using a 3-fold serial dilution of selinexor and a 5-fold serial dilution of either MK-2206 or nutlin-3a. Cell viability was assessed 72 h post drug treatment by adding Cell Titer Glo 2.0 (Promega) and measuring luminescence in a SpectraMax i3 multi-mode plate reader.\n\n#### Dose-response models\n\nTo determine the drug response of the different samples, we first transformed the survival data of each replicate to their reference sample (i.e., response at drug concentration 0 nM) then computed the mean response across the four replicates for each drug concentration and sample. The drug concentration and mean response were fitted to a modified Hill function describing the dose response:\n\nR=mDnkn+Dn\n\n(Equation 1)\n\nwhere R is the relative response (dimensionless, between zero and one) and D is the drug dose (in nM). The parameters m and n (dimensionless) control the intercept and steepness of the curve respectively, k (nM) also contributes to the curvature of the function. The models were fitted using the nonlinear least squares method implemented in the scipy Python package ([Virtanen et al., 2020](#bib73)) (v1.4.1). Considering our data and feasibility, we considered a parameter initial guess of 1000 nM for k, 1 for m and −1 for n. Furthermore, the following boundaries were also considered in the optimization: [0, ∞) for k and m and (-∞, 0] for n. Once the model parameters were fitted, the EC50 was computed by considering R = 0.5 and solving (1) for D (which will correspond to EC50), such that:\n\nEC50=kn2m−1n\n\n(Equation 2)\n\n#### Western blotting\n\nAfter drug treatment, cells were collected and washed in PBS, lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors while standing on ice for 20 min with vortexing every 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged, collected, and boiled for 10 min at 70°C together with LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and reducing agent (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). Samples were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to low-fluorescent PVDF membranes (Immobilon-FL, Merck Millipore) using a Power Blotter (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (Blocker™ FL, Thermo Fisher), incubated with primary antibodies over night at 4°C, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS-Tween (0.05%), incubated with species-specific secondary antibody for 1 h at RT (Alexa Fluor™ Plus 647 or Alexa Fluor™ Plus 800, Invitrogen) or species-specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed 3 × 5 min, and developed using an iBright™ FL-1500 (Thermo Fisher) or the Novex ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Reagent Kit (Invitrogen) and band detection by exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham, GE Healthcare). Signal intensity was quantified using iBright Analysis Software (Thermo Fisher) or ImageJ. Primary antibodies used were anti rabbit-phospho-Rb (S780) (D59B7) (CST8180) and mouse anti-Rb (4H1) (CST9309), rabbit anti-cleaved PARP (CST5625), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (CST9664) mouse anti-β-actin (sc47778), rabbit anti–phospho-AKT (S473) (CST9271) and anti-AKT (CST9272), rabbit anti–phospho-FoxO3a (S253) (D18H8) (CST13129) and anti-FoxO3a (D19A7) (CST12829), mouse anti-p53 (CST48818), rabbit anti-p21 (CST2947), mouse anti-GAPDH (Ab8245; Abcam).\n\n#### Selinexor treatment of cells for phosphoproteomics\n\nCells were seeded in 6-well plates and subsequently treated 2 hours post-thawing with either 1 μM selinexor or DMSO for 6 h. Primary cells were seeded in medium supplemented with growth factors and cytokines as specified above. For cell lines, a minimum of 20 million cells were seeded per treatment and biological replicates. For primary cells, varying numbers of viable cells obtained from each vial prevented us from seeding the same number of viable cells from each sample. Thus, numbers of seeded primary cells varied between 3 million up to >20 million.\n\n#### Sample preparation for TMT labelling and phosphoproteomics\n\nCells were washed in PBS 6 hours post-treatment (1 μM selinexor or 0.01% DMSO) and lysed for 10 min at 99°C in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 5 mM TCEP and 10 mM CAA and whole cell extracts were sonicated. Proteolytic digest was performed by Lys-C (Wako) in an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:300 (w/w) for 1 hour, followed by a dilution with 25 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5, to 2 M guanidine-HCl and further digested overnight with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) 1:100 (w/w). Protease activity was quenched by acidification with TFA and the resulting peptide mixture was concentrated on C18 Sep-Pak (Waters). Peptides were eluted with 40% ACN, followed by 60% ACN and the ACN was subsequently evaporated using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. The final peptide concentration for each sample was estimated by measuring absorbance at A280 on a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). The samples were assigned to one of four TMT-11 multiplexing label sets, including a pooled mix of peptides from different patient AML samples serving as a common reference between TMT sets. Equal amounts of peptide from each sample (_Ex vivo_ samples; TMT set 1: 100 μg/sample, TMT set 2: 76 μg/sample, TMT set 3: 67 μg/sample, TMT set 4: 51 μg/sample, and for cell lines; 300 μg/sample) were labeled with one of eleven (_ex vivo_) or eight (cell lines) different TMT-reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoScientific). After labeling, the samples were pooled and adjusted to 88% ACN, 6% TFA and phosphopeptides were enriched by two sequential rounds using titanium dioxide beads (TiO2; GL Sciences). TiO2 beads were pre-incubated in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (20 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in 80% ACN/1% TFA (5 μL/mg of beads) for 20 min. Beads equivalent to 0.5× starting protein amount were added to each pooled TMT multiplexed sample set, which were then incubated for 20 min while rotating. Beads were washed with 80% ACN/6% TFA, 50% ACN/6% TFA, 80% ACN/1% TFA, 50% ACN/1% TFA and 10%/1% TFA and transferred to C8 StageTips. Phosphopeptides are then eluted with 5% ammonia (Merck) and 10% ammonia/25% ACN and concentrated in a SpeedVac and fractionated with high-pH-reversed-phase fractionation into 12 fractions. Moreover, for cell lines an aliquot of eluate from each round of enrichment was used for single shot MS analysis.\n\n#### Sample preparation for single-shot proteome analysis\n\nCells from PL-21, NOMO-1, GDM-1 and MV-4-11 were cultured for 3 days and collected was washed twice with PBS. The cell pellets were lysed for 10 min at 95°C in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5% SDS, 5 mM TCEP, and 10 mM CAA, followed by the sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min, and the supernatants collected. 100 μg of proteins were digested overnight 37°C using PAC method ([Batth et al., 2019](#bib5)) in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) containing 0.2 μg of Lys-C and 0.4 μg of Trypsin. The digest was quenched by acidification with formic acid (FA). 750 ng of peptides were loaded on to Evotips (Evosep) for proteome analysis.\n\n#### Subcellular fractionation and LC-MS/MS analysis\n\nCells were seeded in 15 cm dishes at a density of 15 million (PL-21) or 20 million (MV-4-11) cells/dish, and incubated for 6 h with 1 μM selinexor, 1 μM MK-2206, both inhibitors, or DMSO (each condition repeated in four biological replicates). After the incubation with the inhibitors, subcellular fractionation into six fractions and sample preparation for MS analysis were performed as previously described ([Martinez-Val et al., 2021](#bib41)), with slight modifications. The fractions were incubated for 10 min at 90°C with 0.3% SDS, 5 mM TCEP, and 10 mM CAA, followed by the digestion using PAC method ([Batth et al., 2019](#bib5)) and incubated overnight at 37°C in 50 mM TEAB containing 0.5 μg of Lys-C and 1 μg of Trypsin. After the digestion, the beads were removed and the solution was acidified with 40 μL of 10% formic acid (FA). 20 μL of each sample were loaded to Evotips (Evosep) for proteome analysis. The remaining solution were loaded to Sep-Pak tC18 96-well μElution Plate (5 mg Sorbent per well, 37–55 μm, Waters) for desaltning and eluted with 30 μL of 40% ACN and 60% ACN subsequently. The eluents were pooled and subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment. The eluents were adjusted to 80% ACN, 5% TFA, and 1M glycolic acid (GA) and incubated with 20 μL (20 mg/mL) of TiO2 beads (MagResyn), followed by the subsequent wash with 80% ACN/5% TFA/1 M GA, 80% ACN/1% TFA, and 10%ACN/0.2% TFA. The enriched peptides were eluted in 200 μL of 1% ammonia, acidified with 50 μL of 10% TFA, filtered, and loaded on to Evotips for phosphoproteome analysis.\n\n#### LC–MS/MS and MS data analysis\n\nFor TMT-based phosphoproteomics, peptides were analyzed using online nanoflow LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was interfaced with an EASY-nLC system (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Raw MS files were analyzed by MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.17 using the Andromeda search engine ([Cox and Mann, 2008](#bib15)). Proteins were identified by searching the HCD-MS/MS peak lists against a target/decoy version of the human UniProt protein database (UP000005640 release 2017_04 with 21,054 reviewed entries) using default settings. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as fixed modification and protein N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionine, pyro-glutamate formation from glutamine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues were considered as variable modifications. Minimum peptide length was 7 amino acids, “maximum peptide mass” was set to 7,500 Da, the “modified peptide minimum score” and “modified maximum peptide score” were set to 25. Label min. ratio count set to 1. Peptide spectrum match (PSM), protein, and site FDR was set to 0.01. Everything else was set to default values.\n\nSamples for single-shot proteome analysis and spatial proteome analysis of subcellular fractions were analyzed on the Evosep One system using an in-house packed 15 cm, 150 μm i.d. capillary column with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 beads (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) using the pre-programmed gradient for 30 samples per day or 60 samples per day (phospho only). Column temperature was set to 60°C using an integrated column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation, Biberach, Germany) and interfaced online with the Orbitrap Exploris 480 MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using Xcalibur (tune version 1.1). Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, funnel RF level at 40, and heated capillary temperature at 275°C. For single-shot and full-proteome analysis of subcellular fractions in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode, full MS resolutions were set to 120,000 at m/z 200 and full MS AGC target was 300% with an IT of 45 ms. Mass range was set to 350–1400. AGC target value for fragment spectra was set at 100%. 49 windows of 13.7 m/z scanning from 361 to 1033 m/z were used with an overlap of 1 Da. Resolution was set to 15,000 and IT to 22 ms and normalized collision energy was 27%. For phosphoproteome analysis using DIA, we employed 17 windows of 39.5 m/z scanning from 472 to 1143 m/z with 1 m/z overlap. Resolution was set to 45,000 and IT to 86 ms. Normalized collision energy was set at 27%. All data were acquired in profile mode using positive polarity.\n\nAll samples acquired in DIA-mode were analysed by Spectronaut v15.6 (spatial proteomics) or v15.7 (single-shot proteomes) with a library-free approach (directDIA) using the human database (UP000005640_9606 release 2018 with signal peptide removed containing 21,007 reviewed entries), supplemented with a database of common contaminants ([Bruderer et al., 2017](#bib10)). For proteome analysis, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as fixed modification and protein N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine, were considered as variable modifications. Additionally for phosphoproteome analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were included as well. The maximum number of variable modifications per peptide was limited to 3. Peptide spectrum match (PSM), pepetide and protein group FDR was set to 0.01. Cross-run normalization was turned off for spatial proteomics searches and for protein quantification, major protein group aggregation method was changed to sum.\n\n#### Bioinformatics analysis of phosphoproteomics data\n\n##### Data normalization\n\nAll phosphosite intensities were normalized with the Variance Stabilization Normalization (VSN) method by using the vsn package in R v3.54.0 ([Huber et al., 2002](#bib32)). The method was applied separately on each TMT batch of samples and then batch effects were removed with the limma package v.3.42.2 ([Ritchie et al., 2015](#bib57)).\n\nOnly peptides with a phosphorylation site localization probability of at least 0.75 (class 1) were included in the bioinformatic analyses. Volcano plots showing differential phosphorylation upon selinexor treatment for _ex vivo_ and cell lines samples were generated by plotting the –log10 transformed and FDR-adjusted p values (FDR <0.05) derived from a two-sided t-test versus log2-transformed fold changes as indicated. Statistical significance was determined on the basis of a hyperbolic curve threshold of s0 = 0.1 derived from statistical analysis using microarrays (SAM testing; described in ([Tusher et al., 2001](#bib69)) and for phosphoproteomics analysis in ([Hogrebe et al., 2018](#bib30))) using Perseus version 1.6.2.2. To assess sequence bias around regulated phosphorylation sites sequence motif, logo plots (±6 amino acids adjacent to the identified phosphorylated sites) were generated and visualized using the WebLogo tool ([Crooks et al., 2004](#bib16)) with default parameters (p < 0.01). From a list of 120.000 phosphorylation sites, we integrated phosphosite-specific functional scores as reported by Ochoa et al. ([Ochoa et al., 2020](#bib47)) to rank and prioritize the significantly regulated phosphorylation sites in our analysis.\n\n##### Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)\n\nGene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed using the piano package v2.2.0 ([Varemo et al., 2013](#bib71)) in R based on the t- and p-values obtained from the differential expression analysis. The gene sets were obtained from the canonical pathways defined by MsigDB v7.2 ([Subramanian et al., 2005](#bib62)). This package allowed us to compute the enrichment rankings by using different statistical methods and combine their results based on the median ranks of each method (i.e. consensus score). The methods used in this case are: stouffer, reporter, tailStrength, wilcoxon, mean, median, sum, and page (see Väremo et al. for more information). The enriched gene sets are classified into different directionality classes according to the directions in the regulation of their members. These are distinct-directional - for gene sets whose members have a clear up- or downregulation -, mixed-directional - for gene sets whose members have a major regulation direction but some point towards the opposite -, and the non-directional class - for gene-sets with no clear distinction on the directionality of its members. In this study, only the distinct-directional gene sets have been considered.\n\n##### Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA)\n\nKinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis was computed from the log2(FC) values using the kinact v1.0 ([Wirbel et al., 2018](#bib79)) package in Python. The kinase-substrate (i.e. kinase-phosphosites) associations were downloaded from OmniPath ([Turei et al., 2021](#bib67)) (as of November 17th 2020). The algorithm implements the enrichment method as described by Casado et al. which infers kinase activities based on the relationships between them and the measured phosphosites ([Casado et al., 2013](#bib12)).\n\n##### Drug combination synergy scoring\n\nBased on the dose-response model shown in [Equation (1)](#fd1) and given two drugs _a_ and _b,_ we derive the theoretical dose of _b_ that achieves the same response of _a_ as:\n\nRa(a)=Rb(b)=maapkap+ap=mbbqkbq+bq\n\n(Equation 3)\n\nbˆ(a)=maapkbqkapmb−maap+mbapq\n\n(Equation 4)\n\nThen, considering Loewe additivity principle, the expected response of any combination of _a_ and _b_ is defined by:\n\nRabˆ(a,b)=Rb(b+bˆ(a))\n\n(Equation 5)\n\nThe synergy score of a drug combination is then computed as the difference between the expected response and the actual measured response:\n\nSab=Rabˆ−Rab\n\nSuch that negative scores denote subadditivity (antagonistic effect) and a positive score shows superadditivity (synergistic effect).\n\n#### Bioinformatics of DIA-data sets\n\nDataset normalization and imputation of single-shot proteomes were performed using the Spectronaunt software with enabled cross run normalization and global imputation. For the subcellular proteome and phosphoproteome, each fraction was individually normalized and imputed using Prostar software ([Wieczorek et al., 2017](#bib78)). The data set were filtered requiring at least 4 (proteome) or 3 (phosphoproteome) values for at least one condition. Global quantile alignment was used for normalization. For missing values imputation, slsa and det quantile algorithms were used partially observed values (POV) and missing on entire condition (MEC), respectively. Volcano plots showing differential regulation were generated using Perseus as described in the previous section. KEGG term overrepresentation was calculated by InnateDB ([Breuer et al., 2013](#bib9)) with default settings for pathway overrepresentation analysis. To asses for sequence bias around the regulated phosphorylation sites, sequence motif logo plots (±6 amino acids adjacent to the identified phosphorylated sites) were generated and visualized using the IceLogo software ([Colaert et al., 2009](#bib14)) with default parameters (p < 0.05).\n\n### Quantification and statistical analysis\n\n#### Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis of MS data is described in the Bioinformatic analysis sections. Statistical tests of Western blot quantifications were applied for experiments performed in three or more biological replicates as indicated in the figure legends. Results shown are the mean of measurements ±SD. p values were calculated using a two-sample Student’s t test and Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple t test comparisons. Significance was concluded when p < 0.05 indicated by ∗ in the figures.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank members at Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) Center for Protein Research (CPR), at Acrivon Therapeutics, and at Heidelberg University; and Michael Kauffman, Christopher Walker, and Chris Kuepfer from Karyopharm Therapeutics for valuable input to the manuscript.

However, the success of targeted therapy using γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), small molecules blocking Notch cleavage and subsequent activation, has been limited due to development of resistance, thus restricting its clinical efficacy. Here, we systematically compare GSI resistant and sensitive cell states by quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, using complementary models of resistance, including T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models. Our datasets reveal common mechanisms of GSI resistance, including a distinct kinase signature that involves protein kinase C delta. We demonstrate that the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin enhances the anti-leukemic activity of GSI in PDX models and completely abrogates the development of acquired GSI resistance in vitro. Overall, we highlight the potential of proteomics to dissect alterations in cellular signaling and identify druggable pathways in cancer.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-022-28515-1/MediaObjects/41467_2022_28515_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n###  [Proteomic profiling reveals CDK6 upregulation as a targetable resistance mechanism for lenalidomide in multiple myeloma ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28515-1?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 23 February 2022\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41375-022-01651-9/MediaObjects/41375_2022_1651_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n###  [Inhibition of the m6A reader IGF2BP2 as a strategy against T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-022-01651-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 01 August 2022\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-020-72480-y/MediaObjects/41598_2020_72480_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n###  [A computational guided, functional validation of a novel therapeutic antibody proposes Notch signaling as a clinical relevant and druggable target in glioma ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72480-y?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 01 October 2020\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Notch1 (N1) receptor belongs to the Notch family of transmembrane proteins, which are highly evolutionary conserved in vertebrates, with crucial roles in cell-fate choices[1](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR1 \"Artavanis-Tsakonas, S., Rand, M. D. & Lake, R. J. Notch signaling: cell fate control and signal integration in development. Science 284, 770–776 \\(1999\\).\"). Activation of Notch signaling requires interactions between a DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag2) ligand, expressed on the surface of a signal-sending cell, and a Notch receptor (Notch1-4 in mammals), expressed on the surface of an opposing cell (signal-receiving cell). The DSL ligands are type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins, and there are five in mammals, designated as either Delta-like (Dll1, Dll3, and Dll4) or Serrate-like (Jagged1 and Jagged2)[2](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR2 \"D’Souza, B., Miyamoto, A. & Weinmaster, G. The many facets of Notch ligands. Oncogene 27, 5148–5167 \\(2008\\).\"). Ligand binding induces proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor by the γ-secretase protease complex. This results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which migrates to the nucleus and initiates transcription of downstream target genes[3](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR3 \"Kopan, R. & Ilagan, M. X. G. The canonical Notch signaling pathway: unfolding the activation mechanism. Cell 137, 216–233 \\(2009\\).\").\n\nDeregulation of Notch signaling has wide-ranging roles in multiple cancers[4](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR4 \"Aster, J. C., Pear, W. S. & Blacklow, S. C. The varied roles of Notch in cancer. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 12, 245–275 \\(2017\\).\"). Most prominently, activating oncogenic mutations in the N1 gene are found in 75% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases[5](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR5 \"Liu, Y. et al. The genomic landscape of pediatric and young adult T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 49, 1211–1218 \\(2017\\).\"). T-ALL is an aggressive hematological malignancy caused by oncogenic transformation of early T-cell progenitors and their diffuse infiltration in the bone marrow leading to hematopoietic failure[6](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR6 \"Belver, L. & Ferrando, A. The genetics and mechanisms of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Nat. Rev. Cancer 16, 494–507 \\(2016\\).\"). The prognosis of patients with primary resistant or relapsed T-ALL remains poor despite the introduction of intensive chemotherapy regimens[7](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR7 \"Litzow, M. R. & Ferrando, A. A. How I treat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults. Blood 126, 833–841 \\(2015\\).\"). The high mutation frequency of the N1 gene makes its protein product an attractive therapeutic target. This has led to clinical testing of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) that prevent N1 cleavage and subsequent activation[8](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR8 \"Papayannidis, C. et al. A Phase 1 study of the novel gamma-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Blood Cancer J. 5, e350 \\(2015\\).\"). However, clinical development of GSI-based therapies have largely failed thus far, primarily due to lack of evidence of sustained anti-tumor responses[9](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR9 \"Andersson, E. R. & Lendahl, U. Therapeutic modulation of Notch signalling - are we there yet? Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 13, 357–378 \\(2014\\).\"). This indicates that resistance mechanisms may occur, limiting their clinical efficacy.\n\nDespite the advances of precision medicine, the development of resistance to targeted therapies broadly contributes to cancer mortality[10](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR10 \"Konieczkowski, D. J., Johannessen, C. M. & Garraway, L. A. A convergence-based framework for cancer drug resistance. Cancer Cell 33, 801–815 \\(2018\\).\"). Multiple mechanisms are known to cause GSI resistance in T-ALL cells. Loss-of-function mutations affecting the _FBXW7_ gene results in impairment of the main E3-ubiquitin ligase implicated in N1-ICD turnover[11](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR11 \"O’Neil, J. et al. FBW7mutations in leukemic cells mediate NOTCH pathway activation and resistance to γ-secretase inhibitors. J. Exp. Med. 204, 1813–1824 \\(2007\\).\"), leading to residual N1 signaling. Notably, Fbxw7 has also been shown to be involved in the degradation of the cMyc transcription factor[12](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR12 \"King, B. et al. The ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 modulates leukemia-initiating cell activity by regulating MYC stability. Cell 153, 1552–1566 \\(2013\\).\"), known to be the key N1 target gene responsible for N1 leukemogenic potential in T-ALL[13](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR13 \"Chiang, M. Y. et al. High selective pressure for Notch1 mutations that induce Myc in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Blood 128, 2229–2240 \\(2016\\).\"). Moreover, acquired changes in epigenetic marks can induce alternative cMyc transcriptional upregulation through the chromatin regulator Brd4[14](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR14 \"Knoechel, B. et al. An epigenetic mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 46, 364–370 \\(2014\\).\"), which controls an alternative long-range cMyc enhancer[15](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR15 \"Yashiro-Ohtani, Y. et al. Long-range enhancer activity determines Myc sensitivity to Notch inhibitors in T cell leukemia. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 111, E4946–E4953 \\(2014\\).\"). Furthermore, mutational loss of Pten, a phosphoinositide phosphatase that acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating Akt kinase signaling, was originally associated with GSI resistance[16](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR16 \"Palomero, T. et al. Mutational loss of PTEN induces resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in T-cell leukemia. Nat. Med. 13, 1203–1210 \\(2007\\).\"), but subsequent studies have not been able to confirm that finding[17](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR17 \"Mendes, R.

DND-41, HBP-ALL, and ALL-SIL are known to be sensitive to NOTCHi, whereas JURKAT, MOLT-3, and PEER are intrinsically resistant[16](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR16 \"Palomero, T. et al. Mutational loss of PTEN induces resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in T-cell leukemia. Nat. Med. 13, 1203–1210 \\(2007\\).\"). The cell lines in each group were chosen based on their genetic heterogeneity to best mimic cancer diversity (Supplementary Data [1](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM3)). For example, within the resistant group, JURKAT and MOLT-3 harbor _PTEN_ -null mutations, while JURKAT and PEER carry _FBXW7_ mutations, both having been previously linked to GSI resistance[11](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR11 \"O’Neil, J. et al. FBW7mutations in leukemic cells mediate NOTCH pathway activation and resistance to γ-secretase inhibitors. J. Exp. Med. 204, 1813–1824 \\(2007\\).\"),[16](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR16 \"Palomero, T. et al. Mutational loss of PTEN induces resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in T-cell leukemia. Nat. Med. 13, 1203–1210 \\(2007\\).\"). Analysis of cell survival after treatment with the GSI XXI, Compound E, showed that the GSI resistant group tolerated an almost 1000-fold higher half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) on average compared to the sensitive group (Supplementary Fig. [1a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). The observed differential response was not due to the lack of activity of the drug on N1 cleavage in the resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. [1b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). The sensitive cell lines DND-41 and HBP-ALL also showed a cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, while cell cycle progression was unaffected in the sensitive cell line ALL-SIL and all three resistant cell lines (Supplementary Fig. [1c, d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). We further validated ALL-SIL sensitivity by long-term treatment with GSI up to 9 weeks during which no recovery of cell growth was observed (Supplementary Fig. [1e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)).\n\nAs in vitro model of acquired GSI resistance, we isolated a persister cell population from the sensitive cell line DND-41, after 5–6 weeks of treatment with increasing GSI doses (Model n.2; Fig. [1c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1))[14](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR14 \"Knoechel, B. et al. An epigenetic mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 46, 364–370 \\(2014\\).\"). The acquired resistance of persister cells to NOTCHi was confirmed by an almost 1000-fold higher GSI IC50 value than the parental cells (Supplementary Fig. [2a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). We included a short-term GSI treatment (72 h) condition to discern between transient and long-term effects of N1 inhibition (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1)). We validated N1ICD and cMyc protein expression by immunoblotting and confirmed what was previously reported[14](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR14 \"Knoechel, B. et al. An epigenetic mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 46, 364–370 \\(2014\\).\"): N1ICD was completely absent in both short and long-term GSI-treated cells, while the N1 target cMyc was rescued in persister cells (Supplementary Fig. [2b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)).\n\nTo reproduce the development of acquired resistance in patients, we treated two Notch-addicted, Notch1-mutated T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) (PDTALL11 and PDTALL19[18](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR18 \"Agnusdei, V. et al.

Leukemia 28, 278–288 \\(2014\\).\"); Supplementary Data [1](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM3)), after systemic engraftment in NOD/SCID mice, with the Notch1-specific (aNotch1) neutralizing monoclonal antibody OMP52M51, until leukemia occurrence[19](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR19 \"Agnusdei, V. et al. Dissecting molecular mechanisms of resistance to NOTCH1-targeted therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Haematologica 105, 1317–1328 \\(2020\\).\") (Model n.3). Mice were treated with OMP52M51 or the control anti-Cd20 antibody Rituximab (RTX) once a week. Resistance to OMP52M51 treatment appeared with different kinetics in the two PDX analyzed (after 43 days of PDTALL19 and 80 days of PDTALL11), as previously described[19](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR19 \"Agnusdei, V. et al. Dissecting molecular mechanisms of resistance to NOTCH1-targeted therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Haematologica 105, 1317–1328 \\(2020\\).\"). In both models, resistant cells showed downregulation of Notch1 target gene expression and full absence of N1ICD protein expression[19](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR19 \"Agnusdei, V. et al. Dissecting molecular mechanisms of resistance to NOTCH1-targeted therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Haematologica 105, 1317–1328 \\(2020\\).\"). T-ALL cells for MS analysis were obtained from the splenocyte population (Fig. [1d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1)).\n\nTo investigate differential signaling between sensitive and resistant T-ALL cell lines on a global scale, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analysis of two signaling layers: proteome and phosphoproteome (Fig. [1a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1)). We employed two different proteomics strategies across the different experiments (Supplementary Fig. [3](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). For models 1–2, we used an isobaric labeling-based workflow combined with LC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer[20](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR20 \"Kelstrup, C. D. et al. Performance evaluation of the Q exactive HF-X for shotgun proteomics. J. Proteome Res. 17, 727–738 \\(2017\\).\"). Three biological replicates were collected per condition (Supplementary Figs. [1f](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1), g, [2c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). For model n.3, we utilized a single-shot label-free approach in data-independent-acquisition mode without using spectral libraries (direct-DIA) on an Orbitrap Exploris 480[21](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR21 \"Bekker-Jensen, D. B. et al. A compact quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer with FAIMS Interface improves proteome coverage in short LC gradients. Mol. Cell.

A novel LC system embeds analytes in pre-formed gradients for rapid, ultra-robust proteomics. Mol. Cell. Proteomics 17, 2284–2296 \\(2018\\).\"). Five-six mice were allocated per group. In dataset n.1, we quantified 218,847 peptides on 8434 protein groups, 32,565 phosphopeptides on 5100 phosphoproteins and 16,152 localized (class I)[23](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR23 \"Olsen, J. V. et al. Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks. Cell 127, 635–648 \\(2006\\).\") phosphosites. In dataset n.2, we quantified 118,638 peptides on 7430 protein groups, 19,457 phosphopeptides on 4056 phosphoproteins and 11,080 class I phosphosites. In dataset n.3, we quantified 79,849 peptides on 5803 protein groups and 10,639 class I phosphosites corresponding to 10,475 phosphopeptides and 3118 phosphoproteins (Fig. [1e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1)).\n\n### Intrinsic resistance to NOTCHi might be reverted by blocking protein synthesis\n\nTo evaluate if the response to GSI was evident on the proteome level, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) after Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical test among the different cell lines (1122 regulated proteins; Supplementary Fig. [4a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). This analysis revealed that the different cell line proteomes separated on component-1 in two clearly distinct groups reflecting their response to GSI. Next, we sought to identify the differentially regulated proteins among sensitive and resistant cell line groups by performing a Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) statistical test[24](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR24 \"Tusher, V. G., Tibshirani, R. & Chu, G. Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 98, 5116–5121 \\(2001\\).\"). We found 596 regulated proteins: 323 were significantly more abundant in the resistant cell line group (cluster 1, C1) and 273 proteins we upregulated in the sensitive cell line group (cluster 2, C2) (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2); Supplementary Data [2](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM4)). To determine whether a particular transcription factor was the master regulator of the proteins more abundant in either sensitive or resistant cells, we performed a transcription factor enrichment analysis using the ChIP enrichment analysis (ChEA) database[25](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR25 \"Lachmann, A. et al. ChEA: transcription factor regulation inferred from integrating genome-wide ChIP-X experiments. Bioinformatics 26, 2438–2444 \\(2010\\).\"),[26](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR26 \"Kuleshov, M. V. et al. Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server 2016 update. Nucleic Acids Res. 44, W90–W97 \\(2016\\).\") (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)). N1 was found to be the most significantly enriched transcription factor in C2. Among C1 proteins, we revealed the top-enrichment of the Tal1/Scl. Notably, Jurkat and MOLT-3 both harbor a somatic mutation in _TAL1_ promoter causing its hyperactivation[27](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR27 \"Mansour, M. R. et al. Oncogene regulation. An oncogenic super-enhancer formed through somatic mutation of a noncoding intergenic element. Science 346, 1373–1377 \\(2014\\).\"). Taken together, this set of analyses showed that intrinsic N1 addiction can be predicted by the basal overexpression of proteins functionally connected to N1 at the proteome level.\n\n**Fig. 2: Global proteome signature of intrinsically GSI resistant cells.**\n\n[![figure 2](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig2_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/2)\n\n**a** Hierarchical clustering of normalized protein intensities scaled per replicate (columns: Pearson correlation; rows: Canberra distance) for significantly regulated proteins between resistant and sensitive cell lines (unpaired two-sided SAM test: permutation-based FDR < 0.05; s0 = 0.1; _n_ = 9 biologically independent samples examined over three independent experiments). **b** ChIP enrichment analysis (ChEA) performed through Enrichr of all proteins belonging to Cluster1 or Cluster 2.

H. et al. clusterMaker: a multi-algorithm clustering plugin for Cytoscape. BMC Bioinforma. 12, 436 \\(2011\\).\") and GO/pathway enrichment on each sub-cluster[30](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR30 \"Doncheva, N. T., Morris, J. H., Gorodkin, J. & Jensen, L. J.

The major GO terms enriched were diverse metabolic processes, involving biosynthesis and catabolism of amino acids, fatty acid degradation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic processes. To unravel if there was a common mediator among the diverse GO terms enriched in resistant cells, we queried the Connectivity Map (CMap), a large collection of gene-expression signatures in response to 19,811 compounds and 5075 genetic perturbations[31](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR31 \"Subramanian, A. et al. A next generation connectivity map: L1000 platform and the first 1,000,000 profiles. Cell 171, 1437–1452.e17 \\(2017\\).\"). This analysis revealed that the GSI sensitivity profile had the highest similarity to the expression signature of the protein synthesis inhibitors emetine, followed by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor QL-X-138 (Fig. [2e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)).\n\nTo pinpoint phosphosites discriminating GSI sensitivity, we performed a SAM test between the resistant and the sensitive cell line group on the phosphoproteome data, resulting in 107 significantly regulated phosphosites (Supplementary Data [2](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM4)). Through a functional network analysis on all regulated phosphoproteins, we identified in the second biggest cluster a significant enrichment of the KEGG pathway “mTOR signaling” and the Reactome pathway “Translation initiation complex formation” (Fig. [2f](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)), further proving the CMap prediction. To extend these findings to a larger cell line panel and validate the biological relevance of the findings, we performed an independent analysis on a panel of six GSI resistant and three sensitive T-ALL cell lines (Supplementary Data [1](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM3)) from the high-throughput Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project (GDSC)[32](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR32 \"Iorio, F. et al. A landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions in cancer. Cell 166, 740–754 \\(2016\\).\"). This showed that the resistant cell lines are significantly more sensitive to two different mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin (Fig. [2g](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)) and JW-7-52-1 (Supplementary Fig. [4b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). Pten is a known negative regulator of the mTORC1 complex, explaining the observed increase in phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets for the _PTEN_ null cell lines, JURKAT and MOLT-3. For the PEER cell line, which does not harbor a _PTEN_ null mutation, we discovered through the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database[33](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR33 \"Barretina, J. et al. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity. Nature 483, 603–607 \\(2012\\).\") that it has a nonsense mutation (W164*)[34](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR34 \"Dastur, A. et al.

Cancer Res. 25, 312–324 \\(2019\\).\") in the _TSC1_ locus, which encodes for the negative mTORC1 regulator hamartin. Overall, this set of analyses indicated that intrinsic GSI resistance could potentially be reverted by the inhibition of mTORC1 signaling or protein synthesis, in line with previous reports[35](#ref-CR35 \"Chan, S. M., Weng, A. P., Tibshirani, R., Aster, J. C. & Utz, P. J. Notch signals positively regulate activity of the mTOR pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Blood 113, 6172–6181 \\(2009\\).\").\n\n### Acquired GSI resistance in DND-41 partially shares aberrant signaling modules with intrinsic resistance\n\nTo gain insights into the biological bases of acquired GSI resistance in DND-41 cells, we performed a PCA analysis on the proteome data (Fig. [3a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig3)). Notably, the short-term GSI condition was exactly in between parental and persister cells on component-1. However, it appeared to have unique features, separating from both persister and parental cells on component-2. To explore the reproducibility of our proteome dataset against the microarray data published by Bernstein and coworkers[14](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR14 \"Knoechel, B. et al. An epigenetic mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 46, 364–370 \\(2014\\).\"), we performed a linear regression analysis between the two datasets, and we found a considerable direct correlation between the two datasets (Pearson correlation coefficient, _R_ = 0.64; Supplementary Fig. [5a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). To find the differentially regulated proteins among the three conditions, we performed an ANOVA test. We found 1963 differentially regulated proteins (Supplementary Data [3](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)) and performed hierarchical clustering to determine the directionality of the regulation (Fig. [3b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig3)). We identified six expression clusters (C1–6; Fig. [3c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig3)). We ranked the proteins in each cluster by fold-change parental/persister and performed ChEA on the top-100 (Fig. [3d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig3)). Both in C1 (up in GSI & persister) and C2 (up in persister), we identified the Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) significantly enriched. Besides, its expression was slightly higher in persister cells (fold-change = 1.06; FDR-corrected _p_ value, _q_ = 0.02), confirming what was previously reported[14](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR14 \"Knoechel, B. et al. An epigenetic mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 46, 364–370 \\(2014\\).\"). Myb was also enriched in these clusters, showing similarity with intrinsically resistant cells (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)). Intriguingly, Kdm2b’s targets were enriched too; but conversely, they were upregulated in intrinsically sensitive cells. C3 (down in GSI) included the Notch target cMyc (_q_ = 0.005). Indeed, here ChEA identified proteins mainly being under cMyc transcriptional control. We also identified Kdm5b in this cluster, indicating that its targets are downregulated by GSI and rescued in persister cells. This demethylase was also upregulated in intrinsically resistant cells (fold-change = 1.43; _q_ = 0.009). C4 proteins followed the same trend expected for both N1 and its targets (down in GSI & persister). Indeed, N1 itself was part of this cluster (_q_ = 0.0002) and ChEA revealed both N1 and Myc enrichment. These findings indicate that the majority of cMyc targets are still under N1 dependency in persister cells, whereas only a defined group of them is re-expressed after the prolonged suppression of N1. In C5 we again identified N1, indicating that its activity is even more downregulated after long-term GSI treatment than short-term. We also found Gata3, whose activity was upregulated in intrinsically resistant cells. C6 (up in GSI) showed a unique profile, and no overlap with other clusters or dataset 1.\n\n**Fig. 3: Proteomics analysis of drug-tolerant persister DND-41 cells.**\n\n[![figure 3](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig3_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/3)\n\n**a** Principal component analysis (PCA) of all quantified proteins. **b** Hierarchical clustering of normalized protein intensities scaled per replicate (columns: Pearson correlation; rows: Canberra distance) for significantly regulated proteins among conditions (one-way ANOVA: Benjamini–Hochberg FDR = 0.01; s0 = 0.1; _n_ = 3 biologically independent samples).

C1 was enriched in the GO terms: “chromatin binding” and “nucleosome organization”. This suggests that the epigenetic remodeling responsible for resistance development starts from the very beginning of drug exposure. C2 displayed enrichment of several metabolic processes, as “reactive oxygen species metabolic process”. Importantly, ROS clearance enzymes were also overrepresented in the intrinsically GSI resistant cell lines (Fig. [2d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)). One of the main ROS sources in the cell is byproducts of mitochondrial respiration[38](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR38 \"Cadenas, E. & Davies, K. J. Mitochondrial free radical generation, oxidative stress, and aging. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 29, 222–230 \\(2000\\).\"). Indeed, we found the GO term “mitochondrial matrix” enriched in C2, which included several proteins with electron transfer activity. The Reactome term “respiratory electron transfer” was also enriched in acquired resistant cells (Fig. [2d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)). C4 proteins appeared to be involved in protein synthesis at multiple levels, which is consistent with the known role of cMyc as master regulator of protein synthesis[39](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR39 \"van Riggelen, J., Yetil, A. & Felsher, D. W. MYC as a regulator of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Nat. Rev. Cancer 10, 301–309 \\(2010\\).\"). C3 also included proteins involved in protein translation, specifically in ribosome biogenesis. This suggests that persister cells might have to partially rescue translation-related processes in order to survive, which agrees with prior findings in intrinsic resistance (Fig. [2e, f](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)). Proteins belonging to C5 and C6 were enriched in cell cycle-related processes. These changes can likely be explained by the slower proliferation rate of persister cells compared to the parental cells (Supplementary Fig. [5b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). We then analyzed the regulation of individual proteins involved in the cell cycle, whose expression has been shown to be N1-dependent in T-ALL[40](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR40 \"Joshi, I. et al. Notch signaling mediates G1/S cell-cycle progression in T cells via cyclin D3 and its dependent kinases. Blood 113, 1689–1698 \\(2009\\).\"),[41](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR41 \"Rao, S. S. et al. Inhibition of NOTCH signaling by gamma secretase inhibitor engages the RB pathway and elicits cell cycle exit in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cancer Res. 69, 3060–3068 \\(2009\\).\"). While Cdk4 (C5; _q_ = 0.009), Cdk6 (C4; _q_ = 0.0003), and Cdkn1b (C2; _q_ = 0.0002) showed expression profiles consistent with N1 inhibition, Cdkn2d (C6; _q_ = 0.002), known to be repressed by cMyc[41](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR41 \"Rao, S. S. et al. Inhibition of NOTCH signaling by gamma secretase inhibitor engages the RB pathway and elicits cell cycle exit in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Cancer Res. 69, 3060–3068 \\(2009\\).\"), escapes N1 control, consistent with cMyc rescue. We also observed a significant decrease in persister cells of several proteins involved in the DNA damage response (GOBP “DNA repair” enriched in C5). These findings are akin to the recent discovery of “adaptive mutability” in response to Egfr/Braf inhibition in human colorectal cancer[42](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR42 \"Russo, M. et al. Adaptive mutability of colorectal cancers in response to targeted therapies. Science 366, 1473–1480 \\(2019\\).\").\n\nNext, we analyzed the phosphorylation changes induced by long-term GSI treatment in DND-41 cells compared to parental and short-term GSI-treated cells. In the persister-parental comparison, we identified 491 significantly regulated phosphosites, 231 were upregulated and 260 were downregulated. In the persister-GSI comparison, we identified 565 significantly regulated phosphosites, 287 were upregulated and 278 were downregulated (Supplementary Data [3](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM5)). Given the relatively high correlation (_R_ = 0.45) observed between proteome and phosphoproteome for both comparisons (Supplementary Fig. [5c, d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)), we performed a volcano plot analysis, where we highlighted only the phosphosites with the highest degree of regulation, which were not regulated on the proteome level to the same extent (Fig. [4](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig4)). To prioritize functionally relevant phosphosites, we marked only those with a high functional score[43](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR43 \"Ochoa, D. et al. The functional landscape of the human phosphoproteome. Nat. Biotechnol. 38, 365–373 \\(2020\\).\"). This analysis showed a substantial overlap between biological processes regulated on both layers. However, it also allowed us to pinpoint some differences. For example, we noticed the downregulation of the Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (Eif4b) on several sites in the persister-parental comparison, while we observed two different sites upregulated in the persister-GSI comparison, which might represent a way for persister cells to rescue translation initiation, which was highly downregulated on the proteome level.\n\n**Fig. 4: Phosphoproteomics analysis of drug-tolerant persister DND-41 cells.**\n\n[![figure 4](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig4_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/4)\n\nVolcano plot analysis for the Persister/Parental (upper part) and Persister/GSI (lower part) comparisons. Significance was determined through unpaired two-sided _t_ test (Benjamini–Hochberg FDR < 0.01 for Persister/Parental and <0.05 for Persister/GSI; _n_ = 3 biologically independent experiments). For significance analysis, a threshold on the Log2 fold-change was applied, equal to three times standard deviation, which was calculated on all sites, separately for up and downregulated ones. The annotated plots are magnified sections of the volcano plots in the middle. Phosphosites whose corresponding proteins are regulated on the proteome level, using the same criteria applied to the phosphoproteome, are marked in pink (upregulated) and light blue (downregulated). Phosphosites with a functional score >0.5 are represented as filled circles. Only significantly regulated sites with functional scores >0.5 and not regulated on the proteome level are labeled. In the Pers/GSI comparison, shared regulated sites between comparisons are not labeled. The color name indicates the biological process the corresponding protein is involved.\n\n[Full size image](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/4)\n\n### Acquired resistance to NOTCH1i in PDX recapitulates the signaling reprogramming observed in vitro\n\nIn order to gain insights into the biological bases of acquired resistance to aNotch1 mAb in PDTALL11 and PDTALL19 cells, we performed a phospho-proteome profiling of these two PDX models (dataset n. 3, Fig. [1d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1)). Interestingly, PCA on the proteome data showed a separation between control (RTX) and the aNotch1 group on the component-2 in the same direction for both different models (Fig. [5a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5)). This suggests a shared response to the prolonged aNotch1 treatment in the two PDX models. To identify the differentially regulated proteins among control and aNotch1 groups, we performed a one-sample _T_ -test on the log2-transformed ratios and identified 1301 regulated proteins, 504 upregulated and 797 downregulated (Fig. [5b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5); Supplementary Data [5](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM7)). Next, we performed functional network analysis followed by MCL clustering and GO enrichment on the six biggest sub-clusters (Fig. [5c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5)). Among proteins upregulated by aNotch1 treatment, we found enrichment of the GO terms “Chromatin organization”, “Cell adhesion”, “Valine, leucine, and Isoleucine degradation”, “Fatty acid metabolism”. The same terms were also enriched in intrinsic resistant (Fig. [1d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig1)) and persister cells (Supplementary Data [4](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM6)). The terms “Vesicle-mediated transport”, “Neutrophil degranulation”, “GPCR signaling” and “calcium signaling” appeared unique to this dataset. However, we found the KEGG “Chemokine signaling pathway” enriched in C1 (DND-41), which involves GPCR signaling. Among proteins downregulated by aNotch1 treatment, all clusters showed GO term overlap with persister cells. In particular, the first biggest 275-protein cluster showed enrichment of “translation” and “ribosome biogenesis”; the second biggest cluster included proteins involved in cell cycle and DNA repair. We then performed ChEA on each cluster and identified as enriched most of the TFs previously found in DND-41 dataset (Fig. [5d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5)). The only TF following an opposite trend with respect to DND-41 and acquired resistance was Gata3, whose function was increased in PDX aN1 and decreased in DND-41 persister and intrinsically resistant cells.\n\n**Fig. 5: Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of T-ALL PDXs resistant to the anti-Notch1 monoclonal antibody OMP52M51.**\n\n[![figure 5](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig5_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/5)\n\n**a** Principal component analysis of all proteins quantified in at least three mice per group. **b** Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of log2 fold-change anti-Notch1/Rituximab for significantly regulated proteins among conditions (one-sample _t_ test: Benjamini–Hochberg FDR < 0.01; s0 = 0.1; _n_ = 9 biologically independent mice).

Dissecting molecular mechanisms of resistance to NOTCH1-targeted therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Haematologica 105, 1317–1328 \\(2020\\).\") and found a high positive correlation (_R_ = 0.53; Supplementary Fig. [6a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). Not only this corroborates the trends observed at the protein level but also indicates that protein regulatory mechanisms observed here are largely driven by gene expression regulation.\n\nAs for the PDTALL19 model we also generated a proteome dataset after aNotch1 acute treatment (AT) (Supplementary Data [5](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM7)), we compared it with the long-term treatment (resistance). First, we analyzed cMyc protein expression and found it showed the same rescue observed in DND-41 persister cells (Supplementary Fig. [6b, c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). PCA showed that the directionality of the proteome alteration was common between AT and resistance, with the AT being far more extreme, especially for the downregulated proteins, and with a greater standard deviation of the log2 fold-changes (Fig. [5e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5), Supplementary Fig. [6d, e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). This suggests that resistant cells attenuate NOTCH1i protein signature. A possible explanation can be a partial pathway reactivation, likely due to other members of the Notch family compensating for N1 loss, as previously described[44](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR44 \"Choi, S. H. et al. The common oncogenomic program of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PLoS ONE 12, e0185762 \\(2017\\).\"). Notably, we identified the transcriptional regulators Rbpj, otherwise known as Csl, and Creb1 among the proteins with a significantly opposite response between AT and aNotch1 (Supplementary Fig. [6f](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1), Fig. [5f](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5)). In the absence of active Notch, Rbpj is thought to be primarily a transcriptional repressor[3](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR3 \"Kopan, R. & Ilagan, M. X. G. The canonical Notch signaling pathway: unfolding the activation mechanism. Cell 137, 216–233 \\(2009\\).\"). However, it has been proposed that Rbpj might also have a Notch-independent activity[45](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR45 \"Castel, D. et al. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status. Genes Dev. 27, 1059–1071 \\(2013\\).\"). Creb1 has been shown to be significantly enriched on Rbpj DNA-binding motifs[46](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR46 \"Miele, L. Transcription factor RBPJ/CSL: a genome-wide look at transcriptional regulation. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 108, 14715–14716 \\(2011\\).\"). This might represent an adaptation mechanism specific to Notch1-directed therapies, and not GSI, which would require further investigation.\n\nNext, we analyzed the phosphorylation changes induced by aNotch1 compared to RTX. In PTALL19, we identified 294 significantly regulated phosphosites, 173 were upregulated and 121 were downregulated (Supplementary Data [5](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM7)). We then performed a volcano plot analysis, where we highlighted only the phosphosites with a high functional score (Fig. [5g](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5)). We identified a noticeable overlap with the biological processes found for the DND-41 persister dataset (Fig. [4](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig4)). Some specific examples are the upregulation Stat1 phosphorylation (Stat5a phosphorylation was upregulated in the persister-GSI comparison) and the downregulation of Hdac4 phosphorylation (Hdac7 phosphorylation was downregulated in persister cells for both comparisons).\n\n### Kinase signature associated with resistance to NOTCHi pinpoints PKC activation\n\nWe next investigated kinase regulation in the GSI resistant and sensitive states through the Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) algorithm, which scores each kinase candidate based on the relative hyper- or dephosphorylation of the majority of its substrates[47](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR47 \"Casado, P. et al. Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis provides insights into the heterogeneity of signaling pathway activation in leukemia cells. Sci.

This analysis showed that Akt1 was the kinase most significantly upregulated in resistant cells, in line with previous findings[48](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR48 \"Dail, M. et al. Loss of oncogenic Notch1 with resistance to a PI3K inhibitor in T-cell leukaemia. Nature 513, 512–516 \\(2014\\).\"). We also found its phosphorylation increased in resistant cells (JURKAT, MOLT-3, and DND-41 persister) by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. [7a, b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). The common kinase signature associated with GSI resistance also highlighted activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) novel subfamily, including PKC Ɵ, δ, ɛ and η. Moreover, we observed a prominent prevalence of different ribosomal protein S6 kinases (Rps6kb1, Rps6ka1, Rps6ka2). Furthermore, Pak1-2 kinases were found more active in the resistant state.\n\n**Fig. 6: Kinase signature associated with resistance to NOTCHi reveals PKC activation in resistant cells.**\n\n[![figure 6](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig6_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/6)\n\n**a** Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) output is represented in a heatmap.

Targeting PKCδ as a therapeutic strategy against heterogeneous mechanisms of EGFR inhibitor resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Cancer Cell 34, 954–969.e4 \\(2018\\).\"). Therefore, we focused specifically at its targets and identified the phosphorylation of serines 235 and 236 on the ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6) significantly upregulated in three out of five comparisons (Fig. [6b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6)). Notably, these phosphorylation events have been previously reported to enhance the initiation of mRNA translation[50](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR50 \"Holz, M. K., Ballif, B. A., Gygi, S. P. & Blenis, J. mTOR and S6K1 mediate assembly of the translation preinitiation complex through dynamic protein interchange and ordered phosphorylation events. Cell 123, 569–580 \\(2005\\).\"), which is hampered by NOTCHi in resistant cells. Thus, we hypothesized that PKCδ might represent a way for T-ALL cells to escape GSI detrimental effects. Indeed, in intrinsically GSI resistant cells we found an increase of PKCδ protein expression (fold-change = 1.5; _q_ = 0.002; Fig. [2d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig2)) and enhanced phosphorylation on two of its activating sites: Ser299 (fold-change = 2.3; _q_ = 0.004) and Ser645 (fold-change = 2.1; _q_ = 0.006). We further validated these findings by immunoblotting (Fig. [6c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6)) and confirmed the upregulation of _PKCδ_ gene expression in a broader T-ALL cell line panel[33](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR33 \"Barretina, J. et al. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity. Nature 483, 603–607 \\(2012\\).\") (Fig. [6d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6)). In persister cells and PDTALL11, we did not identify PKCδ either in the proteome or the phosphoproteome. However, we found by immunoblotting the Ser645 upregulated in persister cells (Fig. [6e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6)) and PKCδ protein level upregulated in PDTALL11 after aNotch1 treatment (Fig. [6f, g](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6)). Lastly, we identify the activating phosphosite Thr507 (fold-change = 1.8; _q_ = 0.002; Fig. [5g](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5), Supplementary Fig. [7d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)) and the total PKCδ protein level upregulated in PDTALL19 after aNotch1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. [7c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between PKCδ activation and S6 phosphorylation in all models tested (Fig. [6c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6), e–g; Supplementary Fig. [7d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)).\n\nWe further validated the kinase-substrate relationship between PKCδ and S6 by using two different PKC inhibitors, rottlerin and sotrastaurin, which both induced a massive reduction in S6 phosphorylation in all the resistant cell lines tested (Supplementary Fig. [7e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). To exclude that PKCδ regulation of P-S6 was mTOR-mediated, we analyzed the canonical mTOR target P-4e-bp1 Thr37/46 from the same lysates in DND-41 persister cells, and found no regulation (Supplementary Fig. [7f](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)), indicating that S6 is a “bona fide” direct PKCδ substrate.\n\n### Notch and PKC inhibition synergistically affects resistant T-ALL cells’ survival\n\nN1 positively regulates S6 phosphorylation through cMyc in GSI sensitive T-ALL cell lines[35](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR35 \"Chan, S. M., Weng, A. P., Tibshirani, R., Aster, J. C. & Utz, P. J. Notch signals positively regulate activity of the mTOR pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Blood 110, 278–286 \\(2007\\).\"). To evaluate N1 effect on S6 phosphorylation in resistant cell lines, we treated all T-ALL cell lines with GSI for 5 days. This highlighted that N1 inhibition was significantly upregulating S6 phosphorylation in resistant cells, while decreasing it in sensitive cells (Fig. [7a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig7)).\n\n**Fig. 7: Combination treatment targeting Notch and PKC in cells resistant to NOTCHi.**\n\n[![figure 7](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig7_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/7)\n\n**a** Cells were treated for 5 days with GSI (0.5 μM) and the lysates were immunoblotted for the indicated antibodies.

V. et al. Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals widespread full phosphorylation site occupancy during mitosis. Sci. Signal. 3, ra3 \\(2010\\).\"). To rule out that the observed change in the phosphorylation of the mTOR target S6 was caused by GSI-dependent alterations of the cell cycle, we performed a GSI time course in the two sensitive cell lines DND-41 and HBP-ALL. These experiments showed cell cycle arrest after six days of GSI treatment in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. [1d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). Furthermore, we observed a reduction of S6 phosphorylation at the earliest time point of 24 h in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. [8a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)), where no change in cell proliferation was detected (Supplementary Fig. [8b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)), suggesting that the P-S6 decrease is cell cycle-independent. In the ALL-SIL cell line, P-S6 regulation did not show a clear trend within the first 72 h.\n\nWe then investigated if the observed GSI-dependent upregulation of P-S6 in resistant cell lines might be a consequence of PKCδ activation. For this purpose, we used the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin that is a clinical drug (phase II), highly specific towards PKCδ among the different PKC isoforms with very few off-targets at very high concentrations[52](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR52 \"Klaeger, S. et al. The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs. Science 358, eaan4368 \\(2017\\).\") (Supplementary Fig. [9a, b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). We treated resistant cell lines with GSI, sotrastaurin (at a concentration lower than the experimentally determined IC-50; Supplementary Fig. [9c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)) and in combination (Fig. [7b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig7), Supplementary Fig. [9d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). The addition of sotrastaurin to GSI significantly reduced the increase in P-S6 in all the cell lines tested. This crosstalk was specifically directed to P-S6 but not mTOR, as we observed no regulation of P-4e-bp1 (Supplementary Fig. [9h](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). Moreover, PKCδ inhibition alone resulted in a significant upregulation of cMyc protein expression, which was completely abrogated by the combination treatment. The same combination treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on cell growth, as shown by a Bliss independence analysis (Fig. [7c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig7)). These results were independently confirmed in JURKAT cells by using the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (Supplementary Fig. [9e–g](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)).\n\nTo determine if PKCδ activation was responsible for P-S6 upregulation in DND-41 persister cells (Fig. [6e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig6)), we treated parental and persister cells with GSI, sotrastaurin, and the combination (Fig. [7d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig7)). The combination of sotrastaurin and GSI completely abrogated P-S6 increase in persister cells and reduced P-S6 in the parental cells even further than GSI alone. Moreover, PKCδ inhibition alone resulted in a significant increase in cMyc protein expression in parental cells, which was abrogated by GSI, displaying the same behavior observed in intrinsically resistant cells. Also, persister cells exhibited a significant and higher than two-fold increase in sotrastaurin IC50 compared to parental cells (Fig. [7e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig7)) and the combination of GSI and sotrastaurin increased T-ALL cells apoptosis, as proved by the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. [7d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig7)).\n\nTaken together, these experiments show that PKCδ inhibition can restore GSI sensitivity in resistant cells. Moreover, they highlight that the expression of PKCδ and N1 is mutually exclusive, as the inhibition or either of the two leads to the activation of the other. To validate if this is a general feature in T-ALL, we found a significant negative correlation (_R_ = −0.6; _p_ = 0.0009) between _N1_ and _PKCδ_ gene expression in a T-ALL cell line panel[33](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR33 \"Barretina, J. et al. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity. Nature 483, 603–607 \\(2012\\).\") (Supplementary Fig. [10a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). Furthermore, we analyzed RNAseq data from a cohort of 264 T-ALL patients[5](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR5 \"Liu, Y. et al. The genomic landscape of pediatric and young adult T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 49, 1211–1218 \\(2017\\).\"), and we confirmed the general negative correlation observed in the cell line panel (_R_ = −0.14; _q_ = 0.055; Supplementary Fig. [10b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)).\n\n### PKCδ is indispensable for the development of adaptive GSI resistance\n\nSince we observed an early appearance of the GSI resistance protein signature in both DND-41 and PDTALL19 datasets (Figs. [3](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig3)a, [5e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig5)), we hypothesized that the combination of GSI and sotrastaurin could have synergistic effects on GSI sensitive cells, too. To test this, we therefore examined its efficacy on PDTALL19 in vivo. We engrafted NOD/SCID mice with PDTALL19 cells and initiated the treatment when a leukemic burden of ~1–2% of human CD7+ in peripheral blood was reached (day 7). Randomized groups were treated with vehicle, the GSI DBZ, sotrastaurin or the DBZ-sotrastaurin combination. The development of leukemia was evaluated by regular flow cytometric analysis of human CD5 and CD7 T-ALL markers on peripheral blood. The vehicle-treated mice reached the human endpoint (natural death or a leukemic burden higher than 40% CD7-positive (CD7+) in peripheral blood) by day 15. On the same day, three mice per group were sacrificed and leukemic burden was evaluated in peripheral blood (PB), spleen and bone marrow (BM). We observed a significant difference in the percentage of both CD5+ and CD7+ cells in PB between the combination and single-agent therapies (Fig. [8a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8), Supplementary Fig. [11a](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). In the BM we observed a significant difference only for the CD7+ cells (Supplementary Fig. [11b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)). The spleen was almost completely infiltrated in all mice (Supplementary Fig. [11c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)), but we observed a significant reduction of the spleen weight in the combination compared to single-agent therapies, which was directly reflected in the spleen size (Fig. [8b](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8)). Following sacrifice, we further observed that combination therapy significantly prolonged survival compared to treatment with single-agent therapy (Fig. [8c](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8)).\n\n**Fig. 8: Combination treatment targeting Notch and PKC in cells sensitive to NOTCHi.**\n\n[![figure 8](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig8_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/8)\n\n**a** NOD/SCID mice were injected with 1 × 106 PDTALL19 cells on day 1.

DBZ was administered in a 4 days on/3 days off regimen (4 doses in total). Sotrastaurin was administered in a regimen of 5 days on/2 days off (5 doses in total).

Next, GSI treatment (0.5 μM) was performed up to 5 weeks for three different populations: persister cells (DMSO + GSI), sotrastaurin washout (DMSO + GSI), and sotrastaurin (SOTRA + GSI). Live cell count was performed by trypan blue exclusion. _n_ = 2 independent experiments for persister and persister/sotrastaurin; _n_ = 1 for sotrastaurin washout. **e** Cells were harvested at different time points (2–5 weeks) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. 5a and 5b indicate two-time points within week 5.

To do so, we treated the DND-41 parental cells with GSI, sotrastaurin, and the combination. We then compared resistance development induced by long-term GSI treatment between untreated and sotrastaurin-treated persister cells. This experiment showed that continuous PKCδ inhibition completely abolished the rescue of cell growth of drug-tolerant persister cells (Fig. [8d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8)) and induced a stable apoptotic response (Fig. [8e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8)). P-S6 was upregulated already after 2 weeks of GSI treatment. Conversely, cMyc expression was still downregulated after 2–3 weeks and only rescued between week 3rd and 4th. When GSI was administered together with sotrastaurin, no rescue of either P-S6 or cMyc was observed. To discern if the acquired resistant cells were a preexisting population, we pre-treated the DND-41 parental cell with sotrastaurin and then washed the drug out, before GSI treatment. This experiment displayed that sotrastaurin pretreatment did not affect persister cells survival (Fig. [8d](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8)), neither P-S6 nor cMyc expression (Fig. [8e](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig8)). Taken together, this experiment showed that P-S6 is an early hallmark of GSI resistance development that occurs through an adaptive response led by PKCδ (Fig. [9](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#Fig9)).\n\n**Fig. 9: Graphical model for therapeutic inhibition of Notch and PKC in T-ALL cells to prevent drug resistance.**\n\n[![figure 9](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-22787-9/MediaObjects/41467_2021_22787_Fig9_HTML.png)](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9/figures/9)\n\n**a** In sensitive cells, NOTCHi leads to downregulation of its transcriptional target cMyc, which in turn regulates S6 phosphorylation in a mTORC1-dependent manner. **b** After chronic administration of Notch inhibitors, cells adapt to Notch absence through the upregulation of PKCδ, which phosphorylates S6 and sustains cMyc expression in a Notch-independent manner. **c** Notch and PKCδ activation show a mutually exclusive pattern.

V. et al. A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer. Cell. Subpopul. Cell 141, 69–80 \\(2010\\).\"), that functions as a reservoir for acquiring of diverse resistance-causing mutations[54](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR54 \"Hata, A. N. et al. Tumor cells can follow distinct evolutionary paths to become resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition. Nat. Med. 22, 262–269 \\(2016\\).\"). Our results provide a proof of principle that cells intrinsically resistant to N1 inhibition by genetic mutations and drug-tolerant acquired resistant cells share several signaling modules, despite the different origin of resistance.\n\nMolecular mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy can fall into one of three main categories: pathway reactivation, bypass, and indifference[10](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR10 \"Konieczkowski, D. J., Johannessen, C. M. & Garraway, L. A. A convergence-based framework for cancer drug resistance. Cancer Cell 33, 801–815 \\(2018\\).\"). Here we show that persister cells completely switch off Notch signaling, but bypass this inhibition through the activation of several parallel pathways, like PKC activation, converging on cMyc and protein translation. Conversely, PDTALL19 cells seem to become resistant both through pathway reactivation and bypass. Furthermore, we highlight several alternative ‘cellular states’ (pathway indifference), shared between intrinsic and acquired resistance, which could represent further potential targetable vulnerabilities. We observe a metabolic switch towards valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation and fatty acid metabolism in resistant cells. Remarkably, metabolic rewiring converging on alterations of lipid metabolism has been reported also by Agnusdei et al. in the PDTALL19 model resistant to antiNotch1 mAb[19](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR19 \"Agnusdei, V. et al. Dissecting molecular mechanisms of resistance to NOTCH1-targeted therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Haematologica 105, 1317–1328 \\(2020\\).\"). We also identify the upregulation of several classes of ROS scavenging enzymes. Notably, increased detoxification from ROS has previously been associated with cancer drug resistance[55](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR55 \"Allocati, N., Masulli, M., Di Ilio, C. & Federici, L. Glutathione transferases: substrates, inihibitors and pro-drugs in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Oncogenesis 7, 8 \\(2018\\).\"),[56](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR56 \"Januchowski, R., Wojtowicz, K. & Zabel, M. The role of aldehyde dehydrogenase \\(ALDH\\) in cancer drug resistance. Biomed. Pharmacother. 67, 669–680 \\(2013\\).\"). We also notice that acquired resistant cells cannot divide as fast as the parental cells, indicating they could reside in a semi-quiescent cell state allowing them to survive GSI detrimental effects. A similar mechanism was shown in neuroblastoma in response to doxorubicin treatment[57](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR57 \"Ryl, T. et al. Cell-cycle position of single MYC-driven cancer cells dictates their susceptibility to a chemotherapeutic drug. Cell Syst. 5, 237–250.e8 \\(2017\\).\"). This alternative state can also explain how the cells survive to high ROS levels, since a faster DNA replication would lead to high replication stress, genome instability, and cell death, especially in presence of lower DNA repair activity, which was observed in acquired resistant cells.\n\nAcquired drug resistance can appear when drug-resistant tumor cell subpopulations expand under the selection pressure of the drug to drive recurrence (Darwinian model). Cancer cells can also become resistant through rewiring of signaling networks (adaptation model)[58](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR58 \"Wei, W. et al. Single-cell phosphoproteomics resolves adaptive signaling dynamics and informs targeted combination therapy in glioblastoma. Cancer Cell 29, 563–573 \\(2016\\).\"). Here we notice an early appearance of the GSI resistance protein signature in both DND-41 and PDTALL19 datasets. This indicates that rewiring of signaling networks happens rapidly after N1 inhibition, pointing towards the hypothesis of an adaptive mechanism for acquired GSI resistance. Indeed, pretreatment of the DND-41 population with sotrastaurin, followed by long-term GSI treatment, still leads to drug resistance development, whereas resistance cannot occur under continuous combined GSI and sotrastaurin treatment.\n\nFinally, our work suggests that combination treatment of GSI and sotrastaurin evades acquired resistance development. These findings could have translational potential in the near future, especially if the presenilin-1-specific GSI, which showed very limited toxicity effects in vivo[59](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR59 \"Habets, R. A. et al. Safe targeting of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by pathology-specific NOTCH inhibition. Sci. Transl. Med. 11, eaau6246 \\(2019\\).\"), will be tested in clinical trials. However, more work will be needed to outline the role of the different members of the PKC family in the observed synergism with GSI.\n\nOverall, the quantitative datasets described here represent a resource of Notch1 signaling in T-ALL. Through our proteomics approach, we were able to confirm previous findings and uncover unknown mechanisms of signaling rewiring responsible for GSI resistance in T-ALL, paving the way for unique opportunities of therapeutic intervention.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Cell lines\n\nThe human cell lines JURKAT (Clone E6-1) and MOLT-3 were purchased from ATCC. The human cell lines DND-41, HPB-ALL, ALL-SIL, and PEER were purchased from DSMZ. JURKAT, DND-41, and ALL-SIL were cultured in 90% RPMI-1640 Glutamax (Gibco), supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 10,000 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). HPB-ALL and PEER were cultured in 80% RPMI-1640 Glutamax, supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS and 10,000 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C, in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, and routinely checked for mycoplasma, using the EZ PCR Mycoplasma detection Kit (Biological Industries); only mycoplasma-free cells were used. To avoid artefacts derived from long-term culture of immortalized cell lines, typically cells were not kept in culture for more than 2 months, starting from frozen stocks derived from the commercial repository.\n\nPersister cells were generated by treating the DND-41 cells for up to 12 weeks with 0.1–1 μM GSI (GSI XXI, Compound E; Calbiochem). The GSI was chosen based on the original publication where DND-41 persister cells were generated for the first time[14](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR14 \"Knoechel, B. et al. An epigenetic mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Genet. 46, 364–370 \\(2014\\).\").\n\nCell count was performed by trypan blue exclusion on the automated CytoSMART cell counter (Corning).\n\n### Drug treatment\n\nPrior to drug treatment, cells were resuspended in fresh medium at 0.1–1 million cells per ml. The concentration of GSI used was 0.5 μM. Minimum rottlerin (Calbiochem) concentration for short-term treatment prior to immunoblot experiments was chosen at 3 μM; for long-term drug treatment, a concentration of 0.75 μM has been used. Sotrastaurin (Selleckchem) doses used for short-term treatment prior to immunoblot experiments were chosen at 1, 5, and 10 μM; a 5 μM dose was used for long-term drug treatments.\n\n### In vivo drug treatment of T-ALL PDXs\n\nPrimary T-ALL cells (PDTALL) were obtained from the bone marrow of newly diagnosed ALL pediatric patients, according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. For initial xenografts establishment, 6–9 weeks-old NOD/SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/NCrCrl), purchased from Charles River Laboratories, were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 1 × 107 T-ALL cells in 300 ml of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. Secondary transplants were obtained by injecting 5 × 106 T-ALL cells per mouse[18](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR18 \"Agnusdei, V. et al. Therapeutic antibody targeting of Notch1 in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Leukemia 28, 278–288 \\(2014\\).\").\n\nResistance to NOTCHi was developed as previously described[19](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR19 \"Agnusdei, V. et al. Dissecting molecular mechanisms of resistance to NOTCH1-targeted therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. Haematologica 105, 1317–1328 \\(2020\\).\"). 5 × 106 cells of PDTALL11 and PDTALL19 cells were i.v. injected in NOD/SCID mice (5–6 mice/group). Animals were intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated with the humanized anti-human NOTCH1 mAb OMP52M51 (Oncomed Pharmaceuticals Inc.) or control antibody (Rituximab, Roche) until disease progression. Both antibodies were administrated weekly at 20 mg/kg, starting two days after i.v. injection of T-ALL cells. In the acute treatment experiment (only PDTALL19), mice were treated with Rituximab or OMP52M51 four days prior to sacrifice.\n\nTo perform in vivo DBZ/sotrastaurin treatment, PDTALL19 cells were i.v. injected in NOD/SCID mice (1 × 106 cells/mouse; 8–10 mice/group) and animals were i.p. treated with vehicle (2.5% DMSO + 0.5% methylcellulose/0.1% Tween-80 for DBZ and 4% DMSO + 30% PEG 300/H20 for sotrastaurin), DBZ (Tocris), sotrastaurin or the combination. DBZ was administered at 5 mg/kg on a 4 days on/3 days off regimen, as previously described[60](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR60 \"Herranz, D. et al. Metabolic reprogramming induces resistance to anti-NOTCH1 therapies in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nat. Med. 21, 1182–1189 \\(2015\\).\"). Sotrastaurin was administered at 40 mg/kg on a 5 days on/2 days off. Treatment started when a leukemic burden of ~1–2% of human CD7-positive (CD7+) in peripheral blood was reached (7 days after i.v. injection).\n\nMice were sacrificed where they reached 40% of human CD7+ in peripheral blood. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen for further analysis (flow cytometry, proteomics or immunoblotting).\n\nProcedures involving animals conformed to current laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJ L 358, 12/12 1987) and were authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health (894/2016-PR).\n\n### Whole-cell lysis and immunoblotting\n\nFor biochemical assays, whole-cell lysates were generated by using modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [1% NP-40, 0.1% Natrium Deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)]. Lysis buffer was supplemented with 5 mM b-glycerophosphate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and the mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein concentration was measured by using Bradford (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analysis, 10–50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel, Invitrogen), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with the primary antibodies. A list of all the antibodies used in this publication is provided in Supplementary Table [1](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1) in the [supplementary information](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1). After incubation with a secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), the membranes were incubated with the Novex ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Reagent Kit (Invitrogen). Quantification analysis was performed through ImageJ software and images were processed by using GIMP and Adobe Illustrator software. The values shown for quantification are mean ± SEM.\n\n### Cell survival assay\n\nCells were seeded at 0.1–0.5 × 106/mL within 24–48 well plates. Medium and drugs were replenished every 3 days. All conditions contained the same amount of DMSO. Cell viability was measured using the cell counting kit-8 (tebu-bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (BGM LABTECH). Each replicate was measured twice (two technical replicates). All experiments were performed in at least two biological replicates. The IC50 values were derived from a four-parameter non-linear curve fitting using GraphPad Prism software.\n\n### Flow cytometry analysis of T-ALL PDX cells\n\nLeukemic cells were collected from peripheral blood, spleen, and BM of control and treated mice. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mAb against CD5 and phycoerythrin-Cy5-labeled mAb against CD7 (Coulter) were used for the detection of T-ALL cells in mouse samples. Samples were analyzed on the BD FACSCelesta flow cytometer. BD FACSDiva software was used for data acquisition and analysis. Gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Fig. [12](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1).\n\n### Cell cycle analysis\n\n1–2 × 106 cells were stained with the ghost dye violet 450 (Tonbo Biosciences), then fixed and permeabilized by using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was stained by using a solution of 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; Sigma-Aldrich), Ribonuclease A from bovine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich) and PBS (Gibco). Cells were analyzed on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer; raw data were acquired through the BD FACSDiva software and analyzed by using the ModFit LT software. Only single and live cells were used for the analysis. Gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Fig. [12](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1).\n\n### Cell lysis and digestion\n\n#### GndCl-based lysis and in solution digestion\n\nCell pellet was resuspended in boiling lysis buffer (6 M guanidine hydrochloride, GndCl, Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 10 mM chloroacetamide (CAA), 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Cells were boiled for an additional 10 min and further lysed by micro tip sonication (Vibra-Cell VCX130, Sonics, Newtown, CT) for 2 min with pulses of 1 second on and 1 s off at 80% amplitude. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).\n\nThe lysates were digested with Lys-C (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) in an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:200 (w/w) for 1 h followed by a 6-fold dilution with 25 mM Tris, pH 8.5, to 1 M GndCl and further digested overnight with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) 1:100 (w/w) at 37 °C.\n\n#### SDS-based lysis and on-bead digestion\n\nCellular pellet was resuspended in boiling lysis buffer (5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5 mM tris(2-carboxy- ethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 10 mM chloroacetamide (CAA), 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5). Cells were boiled for an additional 10 min and further lysed by micro tip probe sonication. Protein concentration was estimated by BCA assay (Pierce).\n\nProtein digestion using the PAC method[61](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR61 \"Batth, T. S. et al. Protein aggregation capture on microparticles enables multi-purpose proteomics sample preparation. Mol. Cell Proteomics 18, 1027–1036 \\(2019\\).\") was automated on a KingFisher™ Flex robot (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 96-well format, as previously described[21](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR21 \"Bekker-Jensen, D. B. et al. A compact quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer with FAIMS Interface improves proteome coverage in short LC gradients. Mol. Cell. Proteom. 19, 716–729 \\(2020\\).\"). The 96-well comb is stored in plate #1, the sample in plate #2 in a final concentration of 70% acetonitrile and with magnetic amine beads (ReSyn Biosciences) in a protein/bead ratio of 1:2. Washing solutions are in plates #3–5 (95% Acetonitrile (ACN)) and plates #6–7 (70% Ethanol). Plate #8 contains 300 μl digestion solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), LysC in an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:500 (w/w) and trypsin in an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:250. The protein aggregation was carried out in two steps of 1 min mixing at medium mixing speed, followed by a 10 min pause each. The sequential washes were performed in 2.5 min and slow speed, without releasing the beads from the magnet. The digestion was set to 12 h at 37 °C with slow speed.\n\n### Peptide cleanup\n\nProtease activity was quenched by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of ~1%, and the resulting peptide mixture was concentrated using reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge (Waters). Peptides were eluted off the Sep-Pak with 300 μl of 40% acetonitrile (ACN) followed by μl of 60% ACN. The ACN was removed by vacuum centrifugation for 40 min at 60 C and the final peptide concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDrop 2000C (Thermo Scientific).\n\nFor single-shot DIA proteome analysis, samples have been directly loaded on C18 Evotips (Evosep) after acidification.\n\n### TMT labeling\n\nPeptide (250 µg) from each sample was labeled with 1 of 11 different TMT reagents (1 μl of TMT per 10 μg per channel), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After labeling, samples were pooled, acidified, and either used for phosphopetide enrichment or concentrated on SepPaks (Waters). After SepPaks, peptides were eluted with 300 μl of 40% ACN, followed by 300 μl of 60% ACN and by 300 μl of 80% ACN. The combined eluate was reduced by SpeedVac.\n\n### TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment\n\nAfter TMT labeling, samples were pooled, acidified, and adjusted to 80% ACN/6% TFA, and phosphopeptides were enriched by two sequential rounds of titansphere chromatography, using titanium dioxide beads (TiO2; GL Sciences), as previously described[62](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR62 \"Hogrebe, A. et al. Benchmarking common quantification strategies for large-scale phosphoproteomics. Nat. Commun. 9, 1045 \\(2018\\).\"). TiO2 beads were pre-incubated in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB; 20 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in 80% ACN/1% TFA (5 µl/mg of beads) for 20 min. Beads equivalent to 2X starting protein amount were added to each sample, which was then incubated for 20 min while rotating. Beads were transferred to C8 (Sigma-Aldrich) StageTips and washed with 10% ACN/6% TFA, 40% ACN/6% TFA, and 60%/6% TFA. Phosphopeptides are then eluted with 5% ammonia and 10% ammonia/25% ACN and subsequently loaded onto C18 (Sigma-Aldrich) StageTips. Peptides were eluted with 40 and 60% ACN and subjected to Offline High pH reversed-phase HPLC fractionation.\n\n### Automated Ti-IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment\n\nPhosphopeptide enrichment was carried out on a KingFisher™ Flex robot (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 96-well format, as previously described[21](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR21 \"Bekker-Jensen, D. B. et al. A compact quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer with FAIMS Interface improves proteome coverage in short LC gradients. Mol. Cell. Proteom. 19, 716–729 \\(2020\\).\"). 50–250 µg of peptide were used for enrichments with 5–25 µl of magnetic Ti-IMAC HP beads (ReSyn Biosciences). Briefly, the 96-well comb is stored in plate #1, Ti-IMAC HP beads in 100% ACN in plate #2 and loading buffer (1 M glycolic acid, 80% ACN, 5% TFA) in plate #3. The sample volume is minimum doubled with loading buffer while kept in a total of 300 µl and added in plate #4. Plates 5–7 are filled with 500 µl of washing solutions; loading buffer, 80% ACN, 5% TFA, and 10% ACN, 0.2% TFA respectively. Plate #8 contains 200 µl of 1% ammonia for elution. The beads were washed in loading buffer for 5 min at medium mixing speed, followed by binding of the phosphopeptides for 20 min and medium speed. The sequential washes were performed in 2 min and fast speed. Phosphopeptides were eluted in 10 min at medium mixing speed. The eluate is acidified with TFA and loaded directly on EvoTips for further MS analysis.\n\n### Offline high pH reversed-phase HPLC fractionation\n\nFor proteome analysis of TMT-labeled samples, 120 µg of TMT-labeled peptides were resuspended in 5 mM ABC and fractionated using a reversed-phase Acquity CSH C18 1.7 μm 1 × 150 mm column (Waters) on an UltiMate 3000 high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by using the Chromeleon software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The instrument operated at 30 μl per minute. Buffer A (5 mM ABC) and buffer B (100% ACN) were used. 46 fractions were collected without concatenation, as previously described[63](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR63 \"Bekker-Jensen, D. B. et al. An optimized shotgun strategy for the rapid generation of comprehensive human proteomes. Cell Syst. 4, 587–599.e4 \\(2017\\).\"). For phosphoproteome analysis, TMT-labeled samples, enriched for phosphopeptide as mentioned above, were subject to fractionation using the same system as for total proteome but collecting 12 concatenated fractions. Peptides were separated by a multi-step gradient as follows: 0–10 min 6.5%B–15%B, 10–59.5 min 15%B–30%B, 59.5–67 min 30%B–65%B, 67–70 min 65%B–80%B, 70–77 min 80%B, 78–87 min 6.5%B.\n\n### Nanoflow LC–MS/MS\n\nAll TMT samples were analyzed on an Easy-nLC 1000 (Proxeon) coupled to a Q-Exactive HF-X MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific)[20](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR20 \"Kelstrup, C.

Peptides were separated on a 15-cm analytical column (75-µm inner diameter) in-house packed with 1.9-µm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch). The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C, using an integrated column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation). For TMT-proteome, peptides eluted during a 30 min gradient, ranging from 10% buffer B (80% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) to 30% B in 25 min and ramped to 45% B in 5 min at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. The washout followed at 80% buffer B for 4 min. A similar gradient but with 60 min duration was employed for phosphoproteomics samples. The MS was operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Raw data were acquired through the Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nSingle-shot label-free samples were analyzed on the Evosep One system[21](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR21 \"Bekker-Jensen, D.

A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was used at the peptide and protein level. TMT correction factors were not used. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as fixed modification. Protein N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionine (M), Deamidation (NQ), cyclization of N-terminal glutamine to pyroglutamate (PyroGlu) and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (pSTY) were considered as variable modifications and used for protein quantification. Protein quantitation required a minimum one peptide (unique or razor). For Phosphoproteomics data, maximum four variable modifications were allowed per peptide. The “maximum peptide mass” was set to 7500 Da and the “modified peptide minimum score” and “unmodified peptide minimum score” were set to 25, as previously described[20](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR20 \"Kelstrup, C.

Clustering network analysis has been performed by using the MCL algorithm through the Cytoscape plugin clusterMaker2[29](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR29 \"Morris, J. H. et al. clusterMaker: a multi-algorithm clustering plugin for Cytoscape. BMC Bioinforma. 12, 436 \\(2011\\).\").\n\nGO enrichment and pathway analyses were performed in Perseus by performing a Fisher-exact test, with Benjamini–Hochberg correction of the _p_ values, or by using the stringApp[30](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR30 \"Doncheva, N. T., Morris, J. H., Gorodkin, J. & Jensen, L. J. Cytoscape StringApp: Network Analysis and Visualization of Proteomics Data. J. Proteome Res. 18, 623–632 \\(2019\\).\") in Cytoscape. All (phospho)-proteins quantified were used as background.\n\nConnectivity map analysis[31](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR31 \"Subramanian, A. et al. A next generation connectivity map: L1000 platform and the first 1,000,000 profiles. Cell 171, 1437–1452.e17 \\(2017\\).\") was performed and visualized by using the online tool available at <https://clue.io/>. To identify a shortlist of drugs potentially able to revert the GSI resistant cell proteome towards the sensitivity state, we sorted the proteins more abundantly expressed in resistant cells by their t-test statistics value (resistant/sensitive) and queried the first top 150 as downregulated in the CMap. Conversely, proteins more abundant in sensitive cells were queried as upregulated in the CMap, following the same sorting criteria.\n\nThe Kinase-Substrate (K-S) Enrichment Analysis (KSEA)[47](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR47 \"Casado, P. et al. Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis provides insights into the heterogeneity of signaling pathway activation in leukemia cells. Sci. Signal. 6, rs6 \\(2013\\).\") was performed by using the R package KSEA app[69](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR69 \"Wiredja, D. D., Koyutürk, M. & Chance, M. R. The KSEA App: a web-based tool for kinase activity inference from quantitative phosphoproteomics. Bioinformatics 33, 3489–3491 \\(2017\\).\"). To extract known K-S relationships the database phosphositeplus (PSP) was used. Since only a small portion of experimentally identified phosphosites have documented K-S annotations in PSP, we expanded the K-S database to include relationships predicted by NetworKIN with a NetworKIN score minimum of 3. The chosen FDR cutoff (Benjamini–Hochberg correction) for significantly differential kinase activity was set at 0.05. Kinases with <4 substrates were excluded from the analysis. KSEA was run for five different comparisons: aN1/RTX PDTALL19, aN1/RTX PDTALL11, PERS/PAR, PERS/GSI and RES/SENS. K-means row clustering (_N_ = 3) of the KSEA Z-scores was performed using the R package Complex Heatmap.\n\nLinear regression analysis was performed in Excel (Supplementary Figs. [5](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1) and [9](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM1)) or in R.\n\n### Drug combination effect\n\nBliss independence analysis was performed as previously described[70](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR70 \"Demidenko, E. & Miller, T. W. Statistical determination of synergy based on Bliss definition of drugs independence. PLoS ONE 14, e0224137 \\(2019\\).\"). Two drugs A and B have additive effects if the surviving fraction (S) of cells upon simultaneous administration, denoted S(AB), is equal to the product of S(A) and S(B), when the drugs are given separately. Therefore, there is synergy if S(AB) < S(A)S(B), and antagonism if S(AB) > S(A)S(B). Here, Bliss index was calculated as S(AB)-S(A)S(B): a positive value denotes synergy; a negative value denotes antagonism; a value of 0 denotes an additive effect.\n\n### Statistical tests for targeted analyses\n\nA two-sided Student’s _t_ test was used to assess differences between means. A _p_ value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the [Nature Research Reporting Summary](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#MOESM9) linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll raw mass spectrometric data files generated in this study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository[71](/articles/s41467-021-22787-9#ref-CR71 \"Perez-Riverol, Y. et al.
