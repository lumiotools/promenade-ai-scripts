The Company also announced that following meetings with the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the Company intends to submit a Marketing Authorization Application under exceptional circumstances for AAV-AIPL1 in the United Kingdom without the need for further clinical studies. The Company is also initiating discussions with the FDA around the potential for a similar pathway to approval in the U.S. In addition, MeiraGTx announced that the Offices of Orphan Products Development and Pediatric Therapeutics of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted the Company three Rare Pediatric Disease Designations to its AAV8-RK-AIPL1 program, AAV8-RK-BBS10 program, and AAV5-RDH12 program, each for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases.\n\n“The past few months at MeiraGTx have been highlighted by exceptional clinical, regulatory, and research and development advancements,” said Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of MeiraGTx. “In October, we announced positive data from our AAV-GAD bridging study using material manufactured in house at MeiraGTx. This study was a randomized, sham-controlled clinical study of AAV-GAD for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, demonstrating that the treatment is safe and leads to significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key efficacy endpoints including UPDRS Part 3 ’off’ score and PDQ-39 quality of life measure. Based on these extremely promising results, we are engaging with global regulatory agencies to initiate a Phase 3 registrational study.”\n\nDr. Forbes added, “We also just received RPDD for three additional programs in our pipeline, a remarkable regulatory achievement for the Company. This underscores the groundbreaking therapeutic potential of our technology to uniquely address these severe childhood blinding conditions and offer hope to the families impacted. Upon FDA approval of a product with RPDD, we are eligible to receive a priority review voucher which could provide meaningful non-dilutive capital, as such vouchers have sold for $150 million and $158 million in recent weeks.”\n\nDr. Forbes continued, “The AIPL1 program exemplifies how MeiraGTx has leveraged our internal manufacturing infrastructure and clinical expertise and worked with regulators to expedite by many years the delivery of these potentially life changing treatments to affected children. By releasing AAV-AIPL1 under our MHRA manufacturing specials license, MeiraGTx was uniquely placed to provide expert clinicians with a potential therapy for these children prior to formal clinical studies. LCA4 caused by mutations in the _AIPL1_ gene results in blindness from birth, with complete degeneration of the retina by the age of four. Eleven children were treated between 1 and 4 years old with MeiraGTx’s AAV-AIPL1 therapy. All 11 children, each of whom was blind from birth gained vision within 6 weeks of treatment. These extraordinary results supported a successful application to the MHRA Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP), and with the award of the Innovation Passport, allowed an expedited Scientific Advice Meeting with the MHRA. During the meeting, agreement was reached that we are in a position to file a Marketing Authorization Application under exceptional circumstance based on the data from these 11 children with no further clinical studies required. In addition, because of our end-to-end internal manufacturing infrastructure, we have also agreed on the CMC requirement for approval. We have already engaged with the FDA to discuss a path to potential approval in the U.S., and we will continue to explore this type of expedited approval pathway for AIPL1 with other global agencies while investigating a similar strategy with the other RPDD awarded indications, including BBS10.”\n\n“The potential approval of transformative products for rare and devastating pediatric disorders in an expedited fashion is extremely exciting, allowing us to more rapidly advance potential treatments to severely impacted children many years faster than possible via the standard approval pathway. This is an illustration of the practical importance of optimizing our approach to viral vector development, as well as internalizing full commercial ready CMC capabilities, in developing effective treatments for rare, severe, rapidly degenerative diseases.”\n\n**_Recent Development Highlights and Anticipated Milestones_**\n\n**AAV-GAD for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease** :\n\nThe primary study objective of safety and tolerability was met and significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline were demonstrated for key efficacy endpoints at 26 weeks.\n\n**Top-line data summary:**\n\n  * AAV-GAD was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to AAV-GAD treatment.\n  * At Week 26, a statistically significant 18-point average improvement from baseline in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3 “off” medication score was demonstrated in the high dose group (p=0.03), with no significant change in the sham or low dose groups. For the UPDRS Part 3 in the “off” state, a change of 5 to 10 points is considered clinically meaningful.\n  * Significant improvements from baseline in the disease-specific, patient-reported quality of life Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) score were demonstrated in both the high and low dose groups with no significant change in the sham group at Week 26: \n    * In the high dose AAV-GAD group, the PDQ-39 score improved by 8 points from baseline (p=0.02), the low dose group improved by 6 points from baseline (p=0.04), while the 0.2 point worsening in the sham surgery group was not statistically significant. For the PDQ-39, a 2 to 4-point change is considered clinically meaningful.\n    * A dose response in PDQ-39 score was observed, with 100% of participants in the high dose group, 60% of participants in the low dose group, and 25% of participants in the sham surgery group reporting an improvement.\n    * For the PDQ-39 score, there was a trend to significance between the high dose and sham surgery groups at 6 months (n=4 evaluable per group).\n\n\n\n**AAV-AIPL1 for the Treatment of Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA4) Retinal Dystrophy:**\n\n  * Following recent meetings with the MHRA, the Company intends to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) under exceptional circumstances for AAV-AIPL1 in the United Kingdom.\n  * The Company is currently engaging with the FDA to discuss a path forward for regulatory approval in the United States.\n  * MeiraGTx was awarded an Innovation Passport designation by the U.K. Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway Steering Group for AAV8-RK-AIPL1.\n  * Meaningful responses have been observed in 11 out of 11 LCA4 children treated to date with AAV-AIPL1. All children were treated between 1 and 4 years old, all were blind on treatment, and all gained visual acuity 4 or more weeks following treatment.\n  * The Company’s AAV-AIPL1 for the treatment of inherited retinal dystrophy due to defects in the  _AIPL1_ gene has been granted orphan drug and now RPDD by the FDA and orphan designation by the European Commission.\n\n\n\n**Rare Pediatric Disease Designation Awards from the FDA:**\n\n  * The Offices of Orphan Products Development and Pediatric Therapeutics of the FDA has granted RPDD to three of MeiraGTx’s inherited retinal disease programs: \n    * AAV8-RK-AIPL1 for the treatment of LCA4 retinal dystrophy\n    * AAV8-RK-BBS10 for the treatment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) due to _BBS10_ mutations\n    * AAV5-RDH12 for the treatment of _RDH12_ associated retinal dystrophy\n\n\n\nAn RPDD may be granted by the FDA to drugs and biologics intended to treat certain orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S., the serious or life-threatening manifestations of which primarily affect individuals aged 18 years or younger. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program, a sponsor that receives approval for a biologics license application for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible to receive a voucher for a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. PRVs may be used by the sponsor or sold to another sponsor for their use and have recently been sold for between $100 million to $158 million.\n\n**AAV2-hAQP1 for the Treatment of Xerostomia:**\n\n  * Data from the Company’s Phase 1 AQUAx clinical trial were presented in an oral session at the American Academy of Oral Medicine (AAOM) 2024 annual meeting in April 2024, demonstrating that treatment with AAV2-hAQP1 resulted in significant improvements across three different patient-reported outcomes and in saliva production, with no treatment-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities reported.\n  * The Company continues to enroll and dose participants at multiple sites in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. in the Phase 2 AQUAx2 ([NCT05926765](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05926765)) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\n  * The Company recently gained alignment with the FDA on requirements for the ongoing Phase 2 AQUAx2 clinical trial for grade 2/3 radiation-induced xerostomia to be considered a pivotal trial in support of a potential BLA filing.\n\n\n\n**Botaretigene Sparoparvovec for the Treatment of XLRP:**\n\n  * Data from the Phase 3 LUMEOS trial of botaretigene sparoparvovec (bota-vec) for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine is expected towards the end of this year. The Company is eligible to receive up to $285 million upon the first commercial sales of bota-vec in the U.S. and EU and manufacturing tech transfer.\n  * MeiraGTx also entered into a commercial supply agreement with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine for bota-vec manufacturing, which the Company anticipates will generate additional revenue during the product launch.\n\n\n\n**Riboswitch Gene Regulation Technology Platform for**** _in vivo_****Delivery:**\n\n  * MeiraGTx continues to progress its riboswitch technology platform in multiple potential indications, with an initial focus on obesity and metabolic disease and CAR-T for oncology and autoimmune disease.\n  * The Company continues to generate compelling preclinical data with metabolic peptides and hormones including incretins, myokines and leptin which suggests greater efficacy on weight loss as well as positive impact on fat to muscle ratio with certain novel combinations of peptides.\n  * The Company is in dialogue with regulatory agencies and intends to initiate first in human studies using the riboswitch platform for an undisclosed metabolic disease indication in 2025.\n\n\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, MeiraGTx had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $122.9 million as well as approximately $3.3 million in receivables due from Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. The Company believes that with such funds, as well as anticipated near-term milestones from Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine under the asset purchase agreement, together with the tax incentive receivable, it will have sufficient capital to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2026. This estimate does not include the $285.0 million in milestones the Company is eligible to receive under the asset purchase agreement upon first commercial sale of bota-vec in the United States and in at least one of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, and for completion of the transfer of certain manufacturing technology.\n\n**_Financial Results_**\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $125.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $130.6 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nService revenue was $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to progress of process performance qualification (PPQ) services under the asset purchase agreement and related agreements with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine.\n\nThere was no license revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the termination of the collaboration agreement concurrent with the execution of the asset purchase agreement with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine.\n\nCost of service revenue was $12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to progress of PPQ services under the asset purchase agreement and related agreements with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $2.7 million was primarily due to an increase in legal and accounting fees, other office related costs, payroll and payroll-related costs and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation, rent and facilities costs and insurance costs.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $26.2 million, compared to $27.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $1.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing costs primarily due to an increase in the number of batches of clinical trial material produced, which costs were charged to the clinical programs, a reduction in manufacturing material purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as well as a reclassification of cost of service revenue due to progress of PPQ services provided under the asset purchase agreement and related agreements. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in reimbursements from Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine as the reimbursement for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was in connection with research funding provided under the collaboration agreement, which was terminated on December 20, 2023. Expenses related to our preclinical programs increased primarily related to development of our preclinical ocular disease programs and clinical trial expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the number of batches of clinical trial material produced during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which costs were charged from manufacturing costs to the clinical programs. The increase in clinical trial expenses was partially offset by a decrease in costs related to bota-vec as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine is now primarily funding the expenses related to this program as a result of the asset purchase agreement. Additionally, other research and development expenses increased.\n\nForeign currency gain was $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change of $12.1 million was primarily due to the restructuring and payment of certain intercompany receivables and payables. Foreign currency gains and losses subsequent to the restructuring are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\nInterest income was $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $0.7 million was due to higher interest rates and cash balances during 2024.\n\nInterest expense was $3.4 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\nLoss on sale of nonfinancial assets was $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was a result of an adjustment to the allocation of the transaction price and $50.0 million milestone payment to the performance obligations identified under the asset purchase agreement. The nonfinancial assets were sold and assigned to Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine including a License Agreement between the Company and UCL Business Plc (now UCL Business Ltd.) relating to the research, development, manufacture and exploitation of bota-vec, and other related assets pursuant in the asset purchase agreement.\n\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $39.3 million, or $0.55 basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share, compared to a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $44.3 million, or $0.74 basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**About AAV8-RK-AIPL1**\n\nAAV8-RK-AIPL1 is an investigational genetic medicine for the treatment of one of the most severe forms of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) owing to genetic deficiency of Aryl-hydrocarbon-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1). It is delivered via subretinal injection to children, and through a one-time administration, AAV8-RK-AIPL1 is designed to deliver functional copies of the AIPL1 gene to cone and rod photoreceptors in the central retina to slow further degeneration and restore vision.\n\n**About AAV8-RK-BBS10**\n\nThe investigational genetic medicine AAV8-RK-BBS10 is an adeno-associated virus with a serotype 8 capsid with a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the human _BBS10_ gene for treatment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) due to _BBS10_ mutations. BBS is a rare genetic disease affecting approximately 1 in 250,000 people around the world. One of the primary symptoms of BBS is visual impairment secondary to retinal degeneration. More than 20 different genes are associated with the development of BBS, with BBS10 accounting for approximately 25% of cases.\n\n**About AAV5-RDH12**\n\nThe investigational genetic medicine AAV5-RDH12 is an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 containing the human _RDH12_ gene for treatment of _RDH12_ associated retinal dystrophy. Defects in retinol dehydrogenase 12 (_RDH12_) account for 3–10% of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD) and is particularly devastating due to early macular atrophy. _RDH12_ encodes retinol dehydrogenase 12, an enzyme expressed in photoreceptors that reduces all-trans-retinal to all-_trans_ -retinol.\n\n**About MeiraGTx**\n\nMeiraGTx (Nasdaq: MGTX) is a vertically integrated, clinical-stage genetic medicines company with a broad pipeline of late-stage clinical programs supported by end-to-end manufacturing capabilities. MeiraGTx has internal plasmid production for GMP, two GMP viral vector production facilities as well as an in-house Quality Control hub for stability and release, all fit for IND through commercial supply.

Over 3 years, we have achieved process optimizations yielding AAV titers up to 1x1012 VG/mL at harvest and >40% full capsids prior to polishing purification steps. Product quality attributes such as encapsidated residual plasmid DNA and host cell DNA are demonstrated to be controllable and maintained to satisfactory levels for patient safety through the combination of transfection reagent, small molecule enhancer, and transfection mix formulation parameters. Operating a perfusion-based process has also increased volumetric VG yield by approximately 40% and reduced plasmid DNA usage by at least 25%, without compromising on AAV productivity and product quality, demonstrating additional cost savings.\n\n**Poster Number:** P0020**Abstract Title:**_AAV-based evaluation of novel in silico promoters to drive expression in rod photoreceptors_**Poster Session II:** Wednesday 23 October from 13:30 to 15:00 CEST**Abstract:** As rods outnumber cones by a ratio of 1:20 or greater in the retina and defects are common in rods leading to various ocular diseases, we sought to design and test novel promoters to drive expression specifically and at high expression levels in rods. Using an AI-assisted promoter engineering approach, ten novel promoter sequences were initially designed, cloned into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) backbone carrying eGFP and finally packaged into AAV5 or AAV7m8. In addition, AAV5 and AAV7m8 vectors were produced carrying the commonly used rhodopsin kinase (RK) promoter and eGFP. Following the initial screen, five second-generation, improved promoter sequences were designed combining elements from preferred performers of the first screen and again packaged into AAV5 and AAV7m8 for additional analysis. Wild-type mice received subretinal injections with the AAV5 vectors to assess promoter activity in the murine retina. Four weeks post vector administration, eyes were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis and qPCR expression analysis to determine specificity and expression levels, respectively. In parallel, the AAV7m8 vectors were used to assess promoter activity in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids. Three weeks post-transduction, organoids were fixed and dissociated into single cells for FACS analysis or cryosectioned for immunohistochemistry. Sections were stained with markers of rod and cone photoreceptors and quantitatively assessed for eGFP co-expression. Lead candidates were identified based on promoter specificity to rod photoreceptors, determined by immunohistochemistry, and promoter strength, measuring expression level using qPCR or signal intensity using FACS.\n\n**Poster Number:** P0129**Abstract Title:** _Identification of highly potent and tissue-specific promoters with massively parallel screening_**Poster Session III:** Tuesday 22 October from 19:30 to 21:00 CEST**Abstract:** Promoters are an integral component of any effective gene therapy. A potent promoter may allow for a therapeutic effect with a lower dosage, which could lower immune responses and manufacturing costs. A short promoter leaves more space for the transgene and mitigates the cargo capacity constraints of current gene therapy delivery methods. In addition, shorter promoters are especially useful for central nervous system applications as neuronal genes tend to have a longer coding region compared to non-neuronal genes. Here, we developed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to screen a synthetic library of over 240,000 promoters that are 182 bp long. This flexible AAV-based platform can be applied to diverse model systems including primary human tissue, iPSC-derived organoids, and non-human primates. Initial screening in transfected mouse Neuro2A cells identified hundreds of potent promoter candidates, of which 34 were selected for independent validation using flow cytometry. We identified 15 promoters exhibiting folds higher expression than CAG despite a 10-fold reduction in size in Neuro2A cells. Furthermore, 5 of these promoters are stronger than CMV and 3-fold smaller. In the human Huh7 cell line, all 15 promoters have lower expression than CAG indicating their specificity. In parallel, potent promoters were identified by this platform in human myotubes, primary mouse neurons, mouse liver, and the mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Independent validation of single candidates confirms the strength of our candidate promoters _in vivo_. These selected promoters can be further engineered using machine learning coupled with rational design to increase promoter potency. This approach allows the screening of hundreds of thousands of rationally designed small promoters (<200bp) capable of driving strong transgene expression in complex model systems. Our selected promoters harbor great potential for future gene therapy applications.\n\n**Poster Number:** P0351**Abstract Title:**_AAV-mediated gene therapy attenuates loss of vision in a mouse model of Bardet-Biedl-Syndrome 10_**Poster Session I:** Tuesday 22 October from 19:30 to 21:00 CEST**Abstract:** Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a group of inherited, autosomal recessive ciliopathies characterized by disturbances of cilia function in multiple cell types, leading to obesity, renal failure, and blindness. More than 20 causative genes are known with many mutations disabling the function of the BBSome, a protein complex regulating the movement of cargo proteins in and out of cilia. Mutations in the BBS10 gene are the second most common cause of BBS and account for more than 20% of all cases. In this study, we set out to optimize and identify an AAV vector carrying the human _BBS10_ gene providing sustained efficacy and a good safety profile for clinical translation.\n\nHuman _BBS10_ either under the control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter or the photoreceptor-specific rhodopsin kinase (RK) promoter was packaged into AAV8 and tested in Bbs10 KO mice at different doses. Whilst the CAG construct did not show efficacy, treatment with the RK construct rescued retinal function and thickness up to six months post-treatment when delivered at a high dose, accompanied by a partial correction of the localization of Syntaxin 3, a partner protein of BBS10. Interestingly, a 5-fold lower dose of AAV8.RK.hBBS10 was not therapeutic, although the equivalent dose of an AAV8.RK carrying mouse _Bbs10_ was efficacious. These findings support the hypothesis that due to a species difference, the potency of the AAV8.RK.hBBS10 is potentially underestimated when assessed in Bbs10 KO mice. In parallel to the work in mutants, we performed a long-term safety study to overexpress human BBS10 under the RK promoter in wild-type mice. Up to six months post-injection, no significant detrimental effects on retinal function or retinal morphology were observed paving the way toward translation. Application for rare pediatric disease designation is currently underway.\n\n**Poster Number:** P0753**Abstract Title:**_Riboswitch-regulated gene and cell therapy_**Poster Session III:** Thursday 24 October from 14:00 to 15:30 CEST**Abstract:** Controlled expression of delivered transgene is critical for both gene and cell therapies. Here, we report that by linking our synthetic aptamer to our alternative splicing gene expression platform, we have created a robust, synthetic mammalian riboswitch cassette that regulates gene expression tightly and dynamically in response to small-molecule inducers. In the presence of the small molecule, the splicing-based expression platform creates an “on” switch by sequestering a splice site of an alternative exon. Riboswitches that respond to these novel small-molecule inducers regulate transgene expression with high dynamic range in a dose-dependent manner. When delivered through an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to the liver or the muscle in mice, the engineered riboswitches reversibly regulate transgene expression via an orally delivered small-molecule inducer, providing precise control of transgene expression, with high dynamic range. With these riboswitches and orally available small-molecule inducers, we were able to regulate hormones such as human growth hormone, growth factors such as erythropoietin (Epo), and therapeutic antibodies such as anti-HER2 antibodies to efficacious levels _in vivo_. RiboCAR-T cells with riboswitch-controlled chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) had more stem/memory-like phenotypes, exhibiting superior anti-tumor activities against lymphoma when compared with conventional CAR-T cells that expressed constitutive CAR.This robust gene regulation system enables both temporal and spatial control of gene expression, providing not only improved efficacy but also a safety mechanism for gene and cell therapies.\n\n**About MeiraGTx**\n\nMeiraGTx (Nasdaq: MGTX) is a vertically integrated, clinical-stage genetic medicines company with a broad pipeline of late-stage clinical programs supported by end-to-end manufacturing capabilities.

Participants had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, a history of levodopa responsiveness for at least 12 months, and a UPDRS Part 3 score of ≥25 points in the \"off\" state. Fourteen subjects were randomized to one of three groups (high dose n=5, low dose n=5, and sham n=4).\n\nSubjects received either AAV-GAD infused bilaterally into the subthalamic nucleus or a sham procedure in a blinded fashion. The total dose per treated participant was 7.0×1010 vg (low dose group) or 21×1010 vg (high dose group). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AAV-GAD, with exploratory efficacy endpoints including the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MDS-UPDRS Part 3 (motor examination) scores in the “off” state and the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire _(_ PDQ-39) score, a key patient-reported quality of life measure in Parkinson’s disease. Subjects who completed this trial may enroll in a long-term follow-up study [_(NCT05894343)_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TeflbEgUFkOQibkt2_U5sj_70IsTpV6s2V5QfFVyABEedAzJdeAtj6aipdI_2EKQUWOi_c3pGI9eMJ6HZG4Z4m3928mUWgNuSnQI8yZ2fuQFcc8J8JMS6kIX7j7AtYpC), where they will be monitored for a total of five years post-treatment.\n\n**Top-line data summary:**\n\n  * AAV-GAD was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to AAV-GAD treatment.\n  * At Week 26, a statistically significant 18-point average improvement from baseline in UPDRS Part 3 “off” medication score was demonstrated in the high dose group (p=0.03), with no significant change in the sham or low dose groups.\n  * Significant improvements from baseline in the disease-specific, patient-reported quality of life PDQ-39 score were demonstrated in both the high and low dose groups with no significant change in the sham group at Week 26: \n    * In the high dose AAV-GAD group, the PDQ-39 score improved by 8 points from baseline (p=0.02), the low dose group improved by 6 points from baseline (p=0.04), while the 0.2 point worsening in the sham surgery group was not statistically significant.\n    * A dose response in PDQ-39 score was observed, with 100% of participants in the high dose group, 60% of participants in the low dose group, and 25% of participants in the sham surgery group reporting an improvement.\n    * For the PDQ-39 score, there was a trend to significance between the high dose and sham surgery groups at 6 months (n=4 evaluable per group).\n\n\n\nDr. Ali Rezai, M.D., executive chair of the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute at West Virginia University (WVU), past president of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, and principal investigator of the AAV-GAD study, stated, “These safety and outcome results are excellent. The extent of motor score improvements in patients who received the high dose treatment combined with significant quality of life improvement measures are very encouraging for both patients and physicians.”\n\n“We are excited about these impressive clinical data in Parkinson’s disease,” said Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of MeiraGTx. “With material made using our proprietary production process at commercial scale, we have demonstrated that AAV-GAD is safe at all doses studied, including a higher dose than previously tested. We have now treated a total of 58 patients in this development program in 3 independent multicenter clinical studies and have seen no SAEs related to AAV-GAD treatment.”\n\nDr. Forbes continued, “With the completion of this randomized, double-blinded bridging study, we have also demonstrated with even very small numbers of subjects that AAV-GAD treatment results in significant and clinically meaningful changes in key efficacy endpoints in Parkinson’s disease. For the UPDRS Part 3 in the “off” state, a change of 5 to 10 points is considered clinically meaningful. The 18-point change observed in the high dose arm in this study underscores the very substantial impact of AAV-GAD treatment in these Parkinson’s patients. Similarly, for the PDQ-39, where a 2 to 4-point change is considered clinically meaningful, the 8-point and 6-point changes observed in the high and low dose groups, respectively, again indicate a substantial and clinically meaningful impact of AAV-GAD treatment.”\n\n“These data demonstrate the impact of using highly targeted local delivery of gene-based therapy to correct the aberrant circuitry that results from the depletion of dopamine in the brain of idiopathic Parkinson’s patients as the disease progresses. AAV-GAD treatment is designed to normalize circuit function in all forms of Parkinson’s disease with its potential benefit not limited to any single type of Parkinson’s. The significant, substantial, and clinically meaningful changes observed in this small, sham-controlled study provide us with a clear path forward in our clinical development strategy and underpin our discussions with regulators in the US, Europe, and Japan with the goal of initiating a Phase 3 study to support approval of this disease-modifying treatment globally.”\n\n**About AAV-GAD**\n\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s, with nearly one million people in the U.S. currently living with Parkinson’s disease and approximately 90,000 new patients diagnosed annually in the U.S. There are more than 10 million people worldwide currently living with PD. Most individuals with PD initially respond to dopamine replacement therapy, yet for a large percentage of patients, over time, this type of treatment is no longer sufficiently helpful while adverse effects of medication can also occur, leading to a considerable reduction in quality of life and the ability to function effectively. The cause of Parkinson’s disease is unknown for a majority of patients, while a much smaller percentage have a known genetic cause, but in all cases, there is dysfunction of the key circuits that control movement. AAV-GAD is an investigational gene therapy designed to reprogram these dysfunctional brain circuits through the local production of GABA, a chemical neurotransmitter that can help restore more normal activity to these critical cells in any form of PD. AAV-GAD is delivered via a one-time infusion through a minimally invasive procedure, using a MeiraGTx proprietary device that allows infusion of the equivalent of one drop of gene therapy solution into the subthalamic nucleus, a key regulator of the circuits responsible for normal movement.\n\n**About MeiraGTx**\n\nMeiraGTx (Nasdaq: MGTX) is a vertically integrated, clinical-stage genetic medicines company with a broad pipeline of late-stage clinical programs supported by end-to-end manufacturing capabilities.
