(NASDAQ: BYND) (“Beyond Meat” or “the Company”), a leader in plant-based meat, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights****1**\n\n  * Net revenues were $81.0 million, an increase of 7.6% year-over-year.\n  * Gross profit was $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, compared to a loss of $7.3 million, or gross margin of -9.6%, in the year-ago period.\n  * Loss from operations was $30.9 million, or operating margin of -38.1%, compared to loss from operations of $69.6 million, or operating margin of -92.4%, in the year-ago period.\n  * Net loss was $26.6 million, or $0.41 per common share, compared to net loss of $70.5 million, or $1.09 per common share, in the year-ago period.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $57.5 million, or -76.3% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.\n\n\n\nBeyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, “We are pleased to report that in the third quarter we returned to growth, increasing net revenues on a year-over-year basis, while continuing to expand gross margin and reduce operating expenses on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Looking ahead, we expect to increase our cash reserves by year-end and pursue further balance sheet restructuring in 2025.”\n\n______________\n\n1 This release includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this release for the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures presented and a reconciliation of these measures to their closest comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\nNet revenues increased 7.6% to $81.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $75.3 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by a 15.8% increase in net revenue per pound, partially offset by a 7.1% decrease in volume of products sold. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by lower trade discounts, price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nU.S. retail channel net revenues increased 14.6% to $35.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $30.5 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 22.6% increase in net revenue per pound, partially offset by a 6.6% decrease in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting weak category demand and price elasticity effects. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by lower trade discounts and price increases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.\n\nU.S. foodservice channel net revenues increased 15.5% to $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $12.5 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 7.9% increase in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting sales of chicken products to a U.S. QSR customer that did not occur in the year-ago period, and a 7.0% increase in net revenue per pound, primarily driven by price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.\n\nInternational retail channel net revenues increased 17.0% to $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $14.2 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 10.5% increase in net revenue per pound and a 6.0% increase in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting distribution gains and increased demand in certain geographic regions. The increase in net revenue per pound primarily reflected lower trade discounts and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by price decreases of certain of our products and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nInternational foodservice channel net revenues decreased 17.2% to $15.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $18.1 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 22.1% decrease in volume of products sold, mainly reflecting decreased sales of burger and chicken products to a large QSR customer in the EU, partially offset by a 6.2% increase in net revenue per pound. The increase in net revenue per pound primarily reflected lower trade discounts and price increases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n**Net revenues by channel (unaudited):**\n\nThe following tables present the Company’s net revenues by channel for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Change**  \n---|---  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 28,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **Amount**| **%**  \nU.S.:  \nRetail| $| 34,969| $| 30,518| $| 4,451| 14.6| %  \nFoodservice| 14,478| 12,535| 1,943| 15.5| %  \nU.S. net revenues| 49,447| 43,053| 6,394| 14.9| %  \nInternational:  \nRetail| 16,565| 14,153| 2,412| 17.0| %  \nFoodservice| 14,994| 18,106| (3,112| )| (17.2| )%  \nInternational net revenues| 31,559| 32,259| (700| )| (2.2| )%  \nNet revenues| $| 81,006| $| 75,312| $| 5,694| 7.6| %  \n  \n**Nine Months Ended**| **Change**  \n---|---  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 28,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **Amount**| **%**  \nU.S.:  \nRetail| $| 116,926| $| 123,167| $| (6,241| )| (5.1| )%  \nFoodservice| 37,132| 39,974| (2,842| )| (7.1| )%  \nU.S. net revenues| 154,058| 163,141| (9,083| )| (5.6| )%  \nInternational:  \nRetail| 46,728| 48,437| (1,709| )| (3.5| )%  \nFoodservice| 49,008| 58,119| (9,111| )| (15.7| )%  \nInternational net revenues| 95,736| 106,556| (10,820| )| (10.2| )%  \nNet revenues| $| 249,794| $| 269,697| $| (19,903| )| (7.4| )%  \n  \n**Volume of products sold by channel (unaudited):**\n\nThe following table presents consolidated volume of the Company’s products sold in pounds for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Change**| **Nine Months Ended**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 28,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **Amount**| **%**| **September 28,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **Amount**| **%**  \nU.S.:  \nRetail| 6,727| 7,199| (472| )| (6.6| )%| 22,296| 26,064| (3,768| )| (14.5| )%  \nFoodservice| 2,271| 2,104| 167| 7.9| %| 6,061| 6,866| (805| )| (11.7| )%  \nInternational:  \nRetail| 3,576| 3,375| 201| 6.0| %| 10,416| 10,868| (452| )| (4.2| )%  \nFoodservice| 4,144| 5,317| (1,173| )| (22.1| )%| 14,219| 16,864| (2,645| )| (15.7| )%  \nVolume of products sold| 16,718| 17,995| (1,277| )| (7.1| )%| 52,992| 60,662| (7,670| )| (12.6| )%  \n  \nGross profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, compared to a loss of $7.3 million, or gross margin of -9.6%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by increased net revenue per pound and decreased cost of goods sold per pound, partially offset by decreased volume of products sold. The decrease in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected lower inventory provision, lower logistics costs and reduced materials costs.\n\nOperating expenses were $45.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $62.4 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to reduced general and administrative expenses, including a $2.0 million insurance recovery benefit, lower non-production salaries and related expenses, and reduced selling expenses.\n\nLoss from operations was $30.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $69.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in loss from operations was driven by increased gross profit and reduced operating expenses.\n\nTotal other income, net, was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to total other expense, net, of $0.7 million in the year-ago period. The increase in total other income, net, was primarily due to increased net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains.\n\nNet loss was $26.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $70.5 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $0.41 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.09 in the year-ago period. The decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the reduction in loss from operations and an increase in total other income, net.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $57.5 million, or -76.3% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights**\n\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash, was $134.9 million and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion as of September 28, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was $69.9 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to $79.3 million in the year-ago period.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “outlook,” “potential,” “continue,” “likely,” “will,” “would” and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are only predictions, not historical fact, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which or whether, such performance or results will be achieved. Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While Beyond Meat believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results. There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made herein including, but not limited to, the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs, including estimates of our expenses, future revenues, capital expenditures, capital requirements and our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, including the terms of such financing (if at all), and to bolster and restructure our balance sheet;

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful additional information to investors about current trends in the Company's operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes. Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n“Adjusted loss from operations” is defined as loss from operations adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company’s ongoing normal business activities.\n\n“Adjusted operating margin” is defined as Adjusted loss from operations divided by net revenues.\n\n“Adjusted net loss” is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company’s normal business activities.\n\n“Adjusted net loss per diluted common share” is defined as Adjusted net loss divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding.\n\nWe consider Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss and Adjusted net loss per diluted common share to be useful indicators of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations. Adjusted net loss per diluted common share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.\n\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring expenses, share-based compensation expense, accrued litigation settlement costs and Other, net, including interest income, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n\n“Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\n\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss, Adjusted net loss per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues rather than their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss and Adjusted net loss per diluted common share exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;\n  * Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss, Adjusted net loss per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues do not reflect accrued litigation settlement costs which reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future increasing our cash requirements;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring expenses that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation expense and therefore does not include all of our compensation costs;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect Other, net, including interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, that may increase or decrease cash available to us; and\n  * other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss, Adjusted net loss per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n\n\nThe following tables present the reconciliation of Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss and Adjusted net loss per diluted common share to their most comparable GAAP measures, loss from operations, operating margin, net loss and net loss per share available to common stockholders—basic and diluted, respectively, each as reported (unaudited):\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nLoss from operations, as reported| $| (30,909| )| $| (69,620| )| $| (118,314| )| $| (181,095| )  \nAccrued litigation settlement costs| —| —| 7,500| —  \nAdjusted loss from operations| $| (30,909| )| $| (69,620| )| $| (110,814| )| $| (181,095| )  \nLoss from operations as a % of net revenues| (38.1| )%| (92.4| )%| (47.4| )%| (67.2| )%  \nAdjusted operating margin| (38.1| )%| (92.4| )%| (44.4| )%| (67.2| )%  \n  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNet loss, as reported| $| (26,576| )| $| (70,492| )| $| (115,416| )| $| (183,034| )  \nAccrued litigation settlement costs| —| —| 7,500| —  \nAdjusted net loss| $| (26,576| )| $| (70,492| )| $| (107,916| )| $| (183,034| )  \n  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n** _(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss, as reported| $| (26,576| )| $| (70,492| )| $| (115,416| )| $| (183,034| )  \nAccrued litigation settlement costs| —| —| 7,500| —  \nAdjusted net loss used in computing Adjusted net loss per diluted common share| $| (26,576| )| $| (70,492| )| $| (107,916| )| $| (183,034| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted average shares used in computing Adjusted net loss per common share| 65,060,729| 64,398,448| 64,880,008| 64,210,809  \nAdjusted net loss per diluted common share| $| (0.41| )| $| (1.09| )| $| (1.66| )| $| (2.85| )  \n  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNet loss per share available to common stockholders—basic and diluted, as reported| $| (0.41| )| $| (1.09| )| $| (1.78| )| $| (2.85| )  \nAccrued litigation settlement costs| —| —| 0.12| —  \nAdjusted net loss per diluted common share| $| (0.41| )| $| (1.09| )| $| (1.66| )| $| (2.85| )  \n  \nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, as reported (unaudited):\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 28, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNet loss, as reported| $| (26,576| )| $| (70,492| )| $| (115,416| )| $| (183,034| )  \nIncome tax expense (benefit)| 6| —| (26| )| 5  \nInterest expense| 1,028| 989| 3,072| 2,967  \nDepreciation and amortization expense| 5,282| 5,779| 17,464| 17,707  \nRestructuring expenses(1)| —| (4| )| —| (631| )  \nShare-based compensation expense| 5,905| 6,478| 17,753| 23,791  \nAccrued litigation settlement costs| —| —| 7,500| —  \nOther, net(2)(3)| (5,405| )| (243| )| (6,005| )| (4,897| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (19,760| )| $| (57,493| )| $| (75,658| )| $| (144,092| )  \nNet loss as a % of net revenues| (32.8| )%| (93.6| )%| (46.2| )%| (67.9| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues| (24.4| )%| (76.3| )%| (30.3| )%| (53.4| )%  \n  \n____________\n\n(1| )| Primarily comprised of legal and other expenses associated with the dispute with a co-manufacturer with whom an exclusive supply agreement was terminated in May 2017.
