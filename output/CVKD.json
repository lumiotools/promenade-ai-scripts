(Nasdaq: CVKD), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing tecarfarin, a new vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulant, has been recognized as the 2024 “Anticoagulation Therapy Company of the Year” by _Pharma Tech Outlook,_ an industry publication focused on breakthrough pharmaceutical technologies. The award underscores Cadrenal’s commitment to addressing the significant unmet needs of patients with implanted left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and other rare cardiovascular conditions who require chronic anticoagulation. Cadrenal aims to develop a better VKA blood thinner for these warfarin-dependent patients.\n\n[ ![Cadrenal Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing tecarfarin, a clinical-stage novel cardiorenal therapy with orphan drug designation. \\(PRNewsfoto/Cadrenal Therapeutics, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1986995/CADRENAL_THERAPEUTICS_LOGO_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1986995/CADRENAL_THERAPEUTICS_LOGO_Logo.html)\n\nIn addition to receiving the award, Cadrenal was featured in the current edition of _Pharma Tech Outlook_. Entitled _[Pioneering Innovation in Anticoagulation for Rare Cardiovascular Conditions](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4306472-1&h=867858035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pharmatechoutlook.com%2Fcadrenal-therapeutics-inc&a=Pioneering+Innovation+in+Anticoagulation+for+Rare+Cardiovascular+Conditions)_ _,_ the article highlights tecarfarin, Cadrenal’s lead candidate that is being developed to potentially overcome many of the challenges associated with warfarin anticoagulation therapy including drug-drug interactions and wide variability requiring frequent dosing changes. Unlike VKA warfarin, tecarfarin uses a unique metabolic pathway that is less affected by drug-drug interactions and kidney impairment. By providing a stable, once-daily, and reversible therapeutic, Cadrenal seeks to improve patient outcomes and ease the burden on patients and healthcare providers who face the complex anticoagulation management needs of this population.\n\n“We are honored to receive this recognition from _Pharma Tech Outlook_ ,” said Quang X. Pham, founder and CEO of Cadrenal Therapeutics. “Our goal is to provide a safer and superior blood thinner option for patients who rely on chronic anticoagulation but are underserved by current treatments. Warfarin, the first VKA anticoagulant, was approved more than 70 years ago yet no significant advancements in oral VKA drugs have occurred since then.”\n\n“Cadrenal Therapeutics has demonstrated a commitment to filling a serious gap in anticoagulation therapy,” said Lisa Winget, Managing Editor at _Pharma Tech Outlook_. “We are pleased to recognize Cadrenal’s innovative approach to developing a new treatment to serve patients with LVADs and other rare cardiovascular conditions.”\n\nWith orphan drug and fast-track designations, tecarfarin is uniquely positioned to fill the gap in chronic anticoagulation treatment options for patients with LVADs and rare cardiovascular conditions such as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with atrial fibrillation.\n\n**About Cadrenal Therapeutics, Inc.** Cadrenal Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing tecarfarin, a new vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to provide potentially safer and superior chronic anticoagulation for patients with implanted cardiac devices or rare cardiovascular conditions. Cadrenal is focused on evaluating tecarfarin versus warfarin in reducing adverse events such as strokes, heart attacks, and bleeds in these patients. With tecarfarin, Cadrenal aims to address many of warfarin’s challenges such as drug interactions, frequent dosing adjustments, and kidney impairment effects, which are common in these patients.

Dr. Mandeep R. Mehra, who holds the William Harvey Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine and is Executive Director, Center for Advanced Heart Disease, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, developed and delivered the TECH-LVAD presentation. In the presentation Dr. Mehra highlighted data from past trials demonstrating the inverse relationship between bleeding rates and time in therapeutic range (TTR) for HM3 patients, and evidence from prior studies indicating tecarfarin’s potential ability to improve TTR. He included data from a trial in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients showing that ESKD does not alter tecarfarin exposure while warfarin exposure is increased, explaining that this is one of the critical differentiators for tecarfarin because many LVAD patients have kidney impairment.\n\nDr. Mehra, who also chaired Abbott’s ARIES-HM3 study in LVAD patients and is a Professor of Medicine, Harvard University, commented, “In the proposed TECH-LVAD trial, we plan to study a much-needed VKA option with the expectation of reducing bleeding events that accompany use of the HM3 LVAD in advanced heart failure. Tecarfarin could potentially be an important therapy for patients with LVADs who all require chronic anticoagulation.”\n\n“As our team progresses discussions with the FDA and Abbott about a tecarfarin study in LVAD patients, increasing tecarfarin data visibility will help us to continue accelerating our development as we plan for investigator outreach and patient recruitment for our tecarfarin trial,” said Quang X. Pham, Chief Executive Officer of Cadrenal Therapeutics.\n\n**ABOUT CADRENAL THERAPEUTICS, INC.**\n\nCadrenal Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing tecarfarin, a new vitamin K antagonist (VKA) designed to offer safer, more effective chronic anticoagulation for patients with implanted cardiac devices or rare cardiovascular conditions.

Through participation in the Corporate Council, Cadrenal will collaborate with the AC Forum as it works to educate and engage the organization’s 15,000 healthcare professional members to improve outcomes for patients on anticoagulants. \n  * Cadrenal and its pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) completed the operational readiness activities necessary to supply active pharmaceutical ingredients and clinical trial materials in accordance with current good manufacturing principles (cGMP).\n  * On October 24, 2024, Cadrenal announced that it successfully raised approximately $5.1 million through its at-the-market facility (ATM). \n  * On November 1, 2024, Cadrenal announced the exercise of warrants generating gross proceeds of approximately $4.7 million. \n  * Recent financing transactions totaling $9.8 million increased its cash balance to approximately $11.3 million and strengthened its balance sheet. The net proceeds provide Cadrenal with additional working capital as it advances tecarfarin toward a pivotal Phase 3 trial. \n  * Q3 2024 operating expenses were $2.5 million, including $0.3 million of non-cash expenses. \n  * Cash used in operating activities totaled $2.2 million during Q3 2024. \n  * Cash and cash equivalent balance of $11.3 million as of November 7, 2024.\n\n\n\n“Momentum is building from our achievement of several critical milestones toward beginning a pivotal clinical trial to evaluate tecarfarin’s superiority to warfarin in LVAD patients,” said Quang X. Pham, Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Cadrenal Therapeutics. “These accomplishments span finance, operations, partner relations, and clinical development and enhance our ability to execute our strategic plan going into 2025.\n\n“Efficiently raising nearly $10 million in recent weeks bolsters funds for operational and clinical development needs. At the same time, we are progressing our dialogue with the FDA and Abbott and moving ahead with our CDMO to manufacture tecarfarin for our Phase 3 trial,” continued Pham. \n\nTecarfarin is the only anticoagulant in development worldwide for patients with implanted cardiac devices and other rare cardiovascular conditions. The oral and reversible drug has been uniquely designed to overcome many of the challenges patients experience with warfarin and to fill a need unmet by direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) that are contraindicated or not recommended by leading cardiology associations for these individuals. If approved, tecarfarin may be a safer and more effective chronic anticoagulant for LVAD patients in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, tecarfarin may prove valuable for other patients where warfarin is not providing recommended anticoagulation because of genetic warfarin resistance or renal impairment making warfarin metabolism difficult. These include individuals with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation or those with mechanical heart valves and hard-to-control anticoagulation, as determined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurements of how long it takes the blood to clot.\n\n**ABOUT CADRENAL THERAPEUTICS, INC.**\n\nCadrenal Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing tecarfarin, a new vitamin K antagonist (VKA) designed to offer safer, more effective chronic anticoagulation for patients with implanted cardiac devices or rare cardiovascular conditions.

Tecarfarin is anticipated to improve outcomes and result in fewer major events for warfarin-dependent patients. Extensive data indicates that the efficacy of tecarfarin, metabolized via a different pathway than warfarin, is not affected by drug-drug interactions and kidney impairment, which are common in these patients. Phase 2/3 clinical trials show that tecarfarin may offer enhanced stability and time in therapeutic range (TTR) that inversely correlate with major events. Tecarfarin is the only new anticoagulant being developed for patients with implanted cardiac devices or rare cardiovascular conditions. Treatment with tecarfarin aims to improve anticoagulation for these underserved patients and their healthcare providers who face difficulties in managing warfarin’s wide variability and risk of gastrointestinal bleeds.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nAny statements contained in this press release about future expectations, plans, and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements.” These statements include statements regarding our planned pivotal trial to evaluate tecarfarin’s effectiveness for LVAD patients, the success of the Company’s collaborative efforts with Abbott, tecarfarin potentially being a safer and more effective chronic anticoagulant for patients with LVADs, tecarfarin filling a need unmet by DOACs that are contraindicated or not recommended, the commencement of trials to evaluate tecarfarin’s superiority to warfarin in LVAD patients and potentially bring the Company’s better anticoagulation solution to those in need, and tecarfarin proving valuable for other patients where warfarin is not providing recommended anticoagulation because of genetic warfarin resistance or renal impairment making warfarin metabolism difficult.

This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information you\nshould consider in making your investment decision. You should read the entire prospectus carefully before making an investment in our securities. You should carefully\nconsider, among other things, our financial statements and the related notes and the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in, or incorporated by reference into, this prospectus.\nOverview\nWe are developing tecarfarin, a new Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) chronic anticoagulant (blood thinner) to prevent heart attacks, strokes, and deaths due to thrombosis (blood\nclots) in patients with implanted cardiac devices or rare cardiovascular conditions. The prevailing treatment for thrombosis is an oral anticoagulant, either a VKA, like warfarin,\nor a direct oral anticoagulant (“DOAC”). VKAs block the production of vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors, such that the blood is “thinned,” preventing clots, while\nDOACs directly block the activity of certain of these clotting factors. Tecarfarin, like warfarin, is a VKA.\nTecarfarin, a once-daily oral and reversible anticoagulation treatment, is expected to improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs for patients that are not well served\nby currently available VKAs and for which DOACs are contraindicated or lack clinical evidence of efficacy. This includes patients with LVADs, patients with ESKD and AFib,\nand patients with mechanical heart valves, among others, where the need for VKA-dependent chronic anticoagulation has been underscored by recent clinical studies.\nTecarfarin is specifically designed to provide safer and more effective anticoagulation than the most commonly prescribed VKA, warfarin. We anticipate that tecarfarin will\naddress many of the bleeding and other adverse events and drug-to-drug interaction challenges of warfarin because tecarfarin is metabolized using a different metabolic\npathway.\nExtensive data indicates that tecarfarin may avoid kidney impairment problems, which are common in these patients. Late-stage clinical trials show that tecarfarin may offer\nenhanced stability and time in therapeutic range (TTR) that inversely correlates with major events. Cadrenal aims to show that tecarfarin will provide less dosing variability,\nenhancing the quality of care for patients and reducing the time-consuming and costly hassles of dosing adjustments for healthcare providers. We believe tecarfarin is the only\nnew anticoagulant being developed for patients with implanted cardiac devices and certain other rare cardiovascular conditions. Despite breakthrough implanted cardiac device\nproducts by leading medical device companies such as Abbott, patients still depend on 70-year-old warfarin for the indefinite future.\nTecarfarin has an orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism (blood clots) in\npatients with an implanted mechanical circulatory support device, which includes left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a heart pump. Tecarfarin also has orphan drug and fast-\ntrack designations from the FDA for the prevention of systemic thromboembolism of cardiac origin in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and atrial fibrillation\n(AFib).\nTecarfarin has been evaluated in eleven (11) human clinical trials in over 1,000 individuals; (269 patients were treated for at least six months and 129 patients were treated for\none year or more). In Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials, tecarfarin has generally been well-tolerated in both healthy adult subjects and patients with chronic kidney\ndisease (“CKD”). In the Phase 2/3 trial, EMBRACE-AC, the largest tecarfarin trial with 607 patients having completed it including those with mechanical heart valves, only 1.6%\nof the blinded tecarfarin subjects suffered from major bleeding and there were no thrombotic events.\nTecarfarin was developed by researchers using a small molecule “retrometabolic” drug design process which targets a different metabolic pathway than the most commonly\nprescribed drugs for the treatment of thrombosis and AFib. “Drug metabolism” refers to the process by which a drug is inactivated by the body and rendered easier to eliminate\nor to be cleared by the body. Most approved drugs, including warfarin, the only FDA-approved VKA, which is a prescribed drug for the treatment of thrombosis, are\nmetabolized in the liver through a pathway known as the Cytochrome CYP450 system, or CYP450, by the enzymes known as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.\nBy using a different metabolic pathway, tecarfarin eliminates or minimizes the CYP450 metabolism in the liver. Patients taking multiple medications that interact with CYP2C9, or\nCYP3A4, or those with impaired kidney function, can experience an overload in the pathway, creating a bottleneck that often leads to insufficient clearance, which results in a\ntoxic build-up of one or more drugs. In some instances, patients taking multiple medications metabolized by the same CYP450 pathway may experience decreased efficacy of\none or more of the medications due to rapid metabolism or increased drug effect and/or toxicity due to enzyme induction. Patient-specific genetic differences can also hinder\ndrug clearance in the CYP450 pathway. Our product candidate tecarfarin was designed to follow a metabolic pathway distinct from the CYP450 pathway and is metabolized by\nboth CYP450 and non-CYP450 pathways. We believe this may allow elimination by large capacity and non-saturable tissue esterase pathways that exist throughout the body\nrather than just in the liver.\nThere are approximately 15,000 patients in the U.S. with LVADs, and recent randomized controlled trials in LVAD patients have documented that currently available VKAs yield\npoor quality anticoagulation despite the tight management of anticoagulation in the clinical trial setting. Implantable LVAD therapy is used to improve quality of life, alleviate\nsymptoms, and extend survival rates in patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of eligibility for cardiac transplant. Patients with LVADs require chronic\nanticoagulation to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications, and under the currently available anticoagulants, they commonly experience bleeding events. Recent data\nreveals that the current standard of care anticoagulant, warfarin, yields suboptimal levels of anticoagulation, leading to excess bleeding complications. LVAD patients require\nlife-long anticoagulant therapy to reduce the risk of pump thrombosis and anticoagulation management in patients with LVADs continues to be a challenge. Patients and their\nclinicians are faced with the daily challenge of balancing the need for adequate anticoagulation versus the bleeding risks that are associated with excess anticoagulation.\nWarfarin is the only available oral anticoagulant for all currently available LVAD devices, however, warfarin is known to be a difficult medication to manage due to its labile\nmetabolism, and its many drug-drug interactions which also impacts the stability of anticoagulation.\n1\nIn patients with LVADs, recent data also highlights the need for a next generation VKA anticoagulant. The ARIES-HM3 study was designed to evaluate the need for chronic\naspirin treatment in patients with the newest LVAD, the HeartMate3 (“HM3”). The use of aspirin in LVAD patients was standard but had never been proven to be beneficial.\nThe ARIES study randomized LVAD patients to continue aspirin, along with warfarin, versus warfarin alone. The main finding of the study revealed that aspirin is not helpful in\nLVAD patients; however, since all patients were receiving warfarin and had careful monitoring of the quality of anticoagulation, the study also provided the opportunity to\ndetermine if the quality of anticoagulation provided by warfarin, had an impact on patient outcomes. The analysis of this carefully controlled and monitored study showed that\nthe average time in the therapeutic range was only 56% with warfarin, far below the target of 70%, and that, despite the superior design of the HM3 device, poor quality\nanticoagulation was associated with excess thrombotic and bleeding events.\nRecent Developments\nWarrant Inducement Agreement\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into the Warrant Inducement Agreement with the Investor Selling Stockholder pursuant to which the Investor Selling Stockholder agreed to\nexercise for cash previously issued warrants to purchase 285,715 shares of common stock (the “Existing Warrants”), at an exercise price of $16.50 per share. The transactions\ncontemplated by the Warrant Inducement Agreement closed on November 4, 2024. We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.7 million, before deducting\nplacement agent fees and other expenses payable by us. Net proceeds of this transaction were approximately $4.2 million.\nIn consideration of the Investor Selling Stockholder’s agreement to exercise the Existing Warrants at the reduced exercise price of $16.50 per share, which includes the payment\nof $0.125 per new Common Warrant, in accordance with the Warrant Inducement Agreement, we issued new unregistered Common Warrants to purchase up to 571,430\nCommon Warrant Shares (200% of the number of shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants) to the holder of Existing Warrants, at an exercise price\nof $16.50 per share. See the section entitled “Description of the Private Placement” included elsewhere in this prospectus for more information.\nAt-the-Market Facility\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we sold 154,144 shares of common stock pursuant to our At the Market Offering Agreement with Wainwright (the “ATM\nAgreement”), generating gross proceeds of $1,635,777 and net proceeds to us of $1,527,946. During October 2024, we sold an additional 237,099 shares of our common stock\npursuant to the ATM Agreement. The October 2024 sales were made at a weighted average price of $14.79 per share, resulting in total gross proceeds of $3,507,817 and net\nproceeds to us of $3,390,933.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn August 19, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) with\nthe Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our common stock that will became effective at 12:01 a.m.\nEastern Time on August 20, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 16 million shares to approximately\n1.1 million shares and the ownership percentage of each shareholder remains unchanged other than as a result of fractional shares, which were eliminated as a result of the\nReverse Stock Split, with stockholders who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fractional share of common stock receiving a cash payment in lieu thereof.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 2022. On August 19, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock\nSplit”) of our common stock that became effective on August 20, 2024.

For as long as we remain an emerging growth\ncompany, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to other public companies. These\nprovisions include, but are not limited to:\n● reduced obligations with respect to financial data, including presenting only two years of audited financial statements and selected financial data, and only two years\nof related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in our initial registration statement;\n● an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as\namended;\n● reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, registration statements and proxy statements; and\n● exemptions from the requirements to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements.\nWe may take advantage of some or all of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest\nof (i) the last day the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross\nrevenues exceed $1.235 billion, (iii) the date on which we have, during the immediately preceding three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, or the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all\nof these reduced burdens. For example, we have taken advantage of the reduced reporting requirements with respect to disclosure regarding our executive compensation\narrangements, have presented only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” disclosure in this Annual Report, and have taken advantage of the exemption from auditor attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting. To the extent that we take advantage of these reduced burdens, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might obtain\nfrom other public companies in which you hold equity interests.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards\napplicable to public companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our timeline to comply with new or revised accounting\nstandards will in many cases be delayed as compared to other public companies that are not eligible to take advantage of this election or have not made this election. Therefore,\nour financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with the public company effective dates for these accounting standards.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller\nreporting companies. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease\nto qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an “emerging growth company” may continue to be available to us as a “smaller\nreporting company,” including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements pursuant to SOX and reduced disclosure about our executive\ncompensation arrangements. We will continue to be a “smaller reporting company” until we have $250 million or more in public float (based on our common stock) measured as\nof the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float (based on our common stock) or a public float (based on\nour common stock) that is less than $700 million, annual revenues of $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year.\n3\nTHE OFFERING\nAll share number and exercise price information presented in this prospectus reflects a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock, which was effected on August 20,\n2024.\nShares of common stock offered by the Selling 590,001 shares, consisting of: (i) an aggregate of 571,430 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of the\nStockholders Common Warrants, and (ii) 18,571 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Agent Warrants.\nCommon stock to be outstanding after this 2,248,772 shares of common stock (which excludes 123,715 shares of our common stock held in abeyance by our transfer\noffering(1) agent), assuming the exercise of all of the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants\nRegistration Rights Under the terms of the Warrant Inducement Agreement, we agreed to file this registration statement with respect to the\nregistration of the resale by the Investor Selling Stockholder of the Common Warrant Shares by the 30th calendar day\nfollowing the date of the Warrant Inducement Agreement, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have this\nregistration statement declared effective within 60 days following the date of the Warrant Inducement Agreement (or 90\ndays following the date of the Warrant Inducement Agreement in the event of a “limited review” or “full review” by the\nSEC) and to keep this registration statement effective at all times until no holder owns any Common Warrants or\nCommon Warrant Shares.\nUse of Proceeds The Selling Stockholders will receive all of the proceeds of the sale of shares of common stock offered from time to time\npursuant to this prospectus.

See the section titled\n“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to this Offering\nResales of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders as a result of this offering may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nWe are registering common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Common Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the\npublic market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The issuance of new shares of common stock could\nresult in resales of our common stock by our current stockholders concerned about the potential ownership dilution of their holdings. Furthermore, in the future, we may issue\nadditional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities exercisable or convertible into common stock. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our\nexisting stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nInvestors who buy shares at different times will likely pay different prices.\nInvestors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different levels of dilution and different outcomes in their\ninvestment results.\nThis offering may cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease.\nThe price per share of our common stock, together with the number of shares of common stock we propose to issue upon exercise of the Common Warrants and Placement Agent\nWarrants and ultimately will issue if this offering is completed, may result in an immediate decrease in the market price of our common stock. This decrease may continue after the\ncompletion of this offering. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering, you may not agree with how we use the proceeds, and the proceeds may not be\ninvested successfully.\nWe have not designated any portion of the net proceeds from the exercise of Common Warrants or Placement Agent Warrants to be used for any particular purpose. Accordingly,\nour management will have broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds and you will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of these net\nproceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible that, pending\ntheir use, we may invest the net proceeds in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for our company. Our management’s judgment may not result in positive returns\non your investment and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information upon which our management bases its decisions.\n5\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe will also need to raise additional capital to expand our business to meet our long-term business objectives.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $21,535,514 as of September 30, 2024 and a net loss of approximately $6,464,099 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, having incurred\nsignificant losses from operations to date. We expect to incur significant expenses and continued losses from operations for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing\ncash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, however, we will require additional financing as we continue to\nexecute our business strategy, including additional funds for the initiation of enrollment of patients and completion of the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial for tecarfarin. Our unaudited\nfinancial statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern; however, we expect our expenses\nto increase in connection with the initiation of enrollment of patients and completion of the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial for tecarfarin. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as\na result of research and development cost increases in addition to general economic and industry factors. In order to meet our expected obligations, we intend to raise additional\nfunds through partnering and equity and debt financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. There can be no assurance that funding will be available on\nacceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. The various ways that we could raise capital carry potential risks. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of\nour equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to\nconduct our business. If we raise funds through partnering such as collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our\ntechnologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to complete the\nplanned Phase 3 trial.\nWe cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur securities are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, a national securities exchange. We cannot be assured that we will continue to comply with the rules, regulations or\nrequirements governing the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq Capital Market or that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq Capital Market in the future. If\nNasdaq should determine at any time that we fail to meet Nasdaq requirements, we may be subject to a delisting action by Nasdaq.\nOn September 6, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”), requiring listed securities to\nmaintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share because our closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days was below $1.00 per share. Pursuant to the Rule, we initially\nhad 180 calendar days (until March 4, 2024), to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the “Compliance Period”). On February 16, 2024, we requested an additional 180\ncalendar days to comply with the Rule. On March 5, 2024, we received written notification from Nasdaq granting our request for a 180-day extension or until September 3, 2024 to\nregain compliance with the Rule. On August 20, 2024, we effected a 1-for-15 reverse stock split. On September 5, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that we had regained\ncompliance with the Rule. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with the Rule or any other Nasdaq continued listing requirements.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange at some future date, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n● reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n● a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a\nreduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n● a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\n6\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nThe Selling Stockholders will receive all of the proceeds of the sale of shares of common stock offered from time to time pursuant to this prospectus. Accordingly, we will not\nreceive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock that may be sold from time to time pursuant to this prospectus; however, we will receive proceeds from the cash\nexercise of the Common Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from such cash exercises for general corporate purposes, which\nmay include operating expenses, research and development, including our pivotal Phase 3 trial, working capital, partnering activities, future acquisitions and general capital\nexpenditures. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds from such cash exercise, if any, to be used specifically for any of such purposes.\nThe expected use of net proceeds from the cash exercise of the Common Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants represents our intentions based upon our current plans and\nbusiness conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve and change. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, specifically\nwith respect to working capital, may vary significantly depending on numerous factors. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net\nproceeds from such cash exercise, if any. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or\ntechnologies that are definitive or probable to close.\nWe will bear the out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred in connection with the registration of shares of our common stock to be sold by the Selling Stockholders pursuant\nto this prospectus. Other than registration expenses, the Selling Stockholders will bear any underwriting discounts, commissions, placement agent fees or other similar expenses\npayable with respect to sales of shares of our common stock.\n7\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nWe currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the growth and development of our business. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends\non our capital stock. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Investors should not purchase our common stock with the\nexpectation of receiving cash dividends.\nAny future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital\nrequirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nDETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE\nThe prices at which the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus may actually be sold will be determined by the prevailing public market price for shares of our common\nstock or by negotiations between the Selling Stockholders and buyers of our common stock in private transactions or as otherwise described in “Plan of Distribution.”\n8\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nThe following description of certain terms of our capital stock does not purport to be complete and is in all respects subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the\nrelevant provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the\n“Bylaws”) and Delaware corporate law. You are strongly encouraged to read our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws in their entirety for a complete description of\nthe rights and preferences of the securities described below, copies of which have been filed with the SEC. These documents are also incorporated by reference into the\nregistration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.\nGeneral\nOur authorized capital stock consists of:\n● 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share; and\n● 7,500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nAt the Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to increase our authorized number of shares of common stock to 125,000,000\nshares of common stock. The increase has not yet been effected and is subject to abandonment if our Board of Directors deems that to be in the best interest of our Company. If\nour Board of Directors does not effect the increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock prior to the one-year anniversary of the Annual Meeting, the vote of our\nstockholders in favor of such amendment will be of no further force and effect and the Board of Directors will again seek stockholder approval before implementing any such\nincrease after that time. Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws summarized below, and under Delaware law, may be deemed to have an anti-\ntakeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a\npremium over the market price for the shares of common stock.\nCommon Stock\nWe are authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 1,658,771 shares are outstanding (excluding the 123,715 shares held in abeyance\nby our transfer agent) as of November 13, 2024.\nWe are authorized to issue one class of common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record for the election of our\ndirectors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences,\nrights or other terms of any outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment. Our directors are\nelected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at our annual meeting of stockholders, and are not entitled to cumulative voting rights. Holders of\ncommon stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor.\nThe payment of dividends, if any, on shares of our common stock are subject to the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding preferred stock, of which there is none. Upon\nour liquidation or dissolution, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive a pro rata portion of all assets remaining available for distribution to stockholders after\npayment of all liabilities and provision for the liquidation of any shares of preferred stock outstanding at that time. The holders of our common stock have no preemptive,\nsubscription or redemption rights, and have no rights to convert their common stock into any other securities. The absence of preemptive rights could result in a dilution of the\ninterest of the existing stockholders should additional shares of our common stock be issued. In addition, the rights of holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be\nadversely affected by, the rights of holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nNo shares of preferred stock are outstanding as of the date of this offering. Our Board of Directors is authorized, without action by our stockholders, to designate and issue up to\n7,500,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors has the right to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative,\nparticipating, optional or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series of designated preferred\nstock. Our Board of Directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and\nother rights of the holders of our common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval\ncould have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. Although we do not currently intend to issue any\nshares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future.\nForum Selection\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in\nthe event that the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) is the exclusive\nforum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent\nof the Company to the Company or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate\nof Incorporation or our Bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware; provided that, if and only if\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or the Company consents in writing to the selection of an\nalternative forum, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America is the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against under the Securities Act.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for\nwhich the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Nothing in our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws preclude stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from\nbringing such claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\n9\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may delay, defer, or discourage another party from acquiring control of us. We expect that these provisions,\nwhich are summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire\ncontrol of us to first negotiate with our board of directors, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders.\nHowever, they also give our board of directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in\na “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder\nattained such status with the approval of our board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes,\namong other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is\nany entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.\nClassified Board of Directors\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes serving three-year terms, with one class being elected each year by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to\nvote on the election.\nProposals of Business and Nominations\nOur Bylaws generally regulates proposals of business and nominations for election of directors by stockholders. In general, Section 5 requires stockholders intending to submit\nproposals or nominations at a stockholders’ meeting to provide the Company with advance notice thereof, including information regarding the stockholder proposing the business\nor nomination as well as information regarding the proposed business or nominee. Section 5 also provides a time period during which business or nominations must be provided to\nthe Company that creates a predictable window for the submission of such notices, eliminating the risk that the Company finds a meeting will be contested after printing its proxy\nmaterials for an uncontested election and providing the Company with a reasonable opportunity to respond to nominations and proposals by stockholders.\nBlank Check Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the designations, rights, preferences of such preferred stock without\nstockholder approval.\nBoard Vacancies\nOur Bylaws generally provide that only our board of directors (and not the stockholders) may fill vacancies and newly created directorships.\nStockholder Action by Written Consent\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of\nstockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before such meeting.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by our board of\ndirectors, Chairman of the board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer.\nAmendment of Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation’s\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage. Our bylaws may be amended\nor repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66⅔%) of the votes which all our\nstockholders would be eligible to cast in an election of directors.\n10\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nOur Bylaws provide indemnification for our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The indemnification\nagreements that we have entered into with each of our current executive officers and that we intend to enter into with each of our directors and executive officers may, in some\ncases, be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation includes\nprovisions that eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages resulting from breaches of certain fiduciary duties as a director or officer, as\napplicable, except to the extent such an exemption from liability thereof is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The effect of these provisions is to restrict\nour rights and the rights of our stockholders in derivative suits to recover monetary damages against a director or officer for breach of fiduciary duties as a director or officer,\nsubject to certain exceptions in which case the director or officer would be personally liable. An officer may not be exculpated for any action brought by or in the right of the\ncorporation. A director may not be exculpated for improper distributions to stockholders. Further, pursuant to Delaware law a director or officer may not be exculpated for:\n● any breach of his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;\n● acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; and\n● any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit.\nThese limitations of liability do not apply to liabilities arising under the federal or state securities laws and do not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive\nrelief or rescission.\nOur Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, and may indemnify other officers, employees and other agents.\nOur Bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or executive officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding.\nWe have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our current executive officers and plan to enter into separate indemnification agreements with our directors\nand executive officers. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors and officers for any and all expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)\njudgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by us) actually and reasonably incurred by such directors or officers or on his or her\nbehalf in connection with any action or proceeding arising out of their services as one of our directors or officers, or any of our subsidiaries provided that such person follows the\nprocedures for determining entitlement to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the indemnification agreement. We believe that these bylaw provisions and\nindemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for\nbreach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might provide a\nbenefit to us and our stockholders. Our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against\ndirectors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us, we have been informed that, in the opinion\nof the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nAt present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any\nthreatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.\nStockholders’ Derivative Actions\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, any of our stockholders may bring an action in our name to procure a judgment in our favor, also known as a derivative action,\nprovided that the stockholder bringing the action is a holder of our shares at the time of the transaction to which the action relates or such stockholder’s stock thereafter devolved\nby operation of law.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Transfer Online, Inc., 512 SE Salmon Street, Portland, Oregon 97214.\nTrading Symbol and Market\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CVKD.”\n11\nDILUTION\nIf you invest in our securities, your interest will be immediately and substantially diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common\nstock and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering.\nDilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of common stock in this offering and the pro forma net\ntangible book value per share of common stock immediately after the completion of this offering. Our net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 was approximately\n$3.4 million, or $2.76 per share of common stock.\nOur pro forma net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024 was approximately $11.0 million or $6.17 per share. Pro forma net tangible book value represents net tangible book\nvalue adjusted to take into account the issuance, subsequent to September 30, 2024, of: (i) 25,000 shares of restricted common stock to a consultant; (ii) 237,099 shares of common\nstock pursuant to the ATM Agreement and our receipt of approximately $3.4 million in net proceeds in connection therewith; and (iii) 285,715 upon exercise of the Existing\nWarrants (assuming the issuance of 123,715 shares of common stock being held in abeyance by our transfer agent) and our receipt of net proceeds of approximately $4.2 million,\npursuant to the Warrant Inducement Agreement.\nAfter giving effect to the pro forma adjustments described in the preceding sentence and (a) the issuance of 590,001 shares of common stock upon the assumed exercise of the\nCommon Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants; and (b) our assumed receipt of approximately $9.8 million in estimated net proceeds from the exercise of the Common Warrants\nand Placement Agent Warrants, and assuming all such sales and issuances were made on September 30, 2024, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of September\n30, 2024 would have been approximately $20.8 million, or $8.77 per share of our common stock. This would result in an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value to\nour existing stockholders of $2.60 and an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value to investors purchasing securities in the offering from the Selling Stockholders.\nThe following table illustrates the per share dilution to investors purchasing shares in the offering:\nExercise price of Common Warrants $ 16.50\nExercise price of Placement Agent Warrants $ 20.625\nNet tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 $ 2.76\nIncrease in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering $ 2.60\nPro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering $ 8.77\nDilution in net tangible book value per share to investors purchasing from holders of Common Warrants $ 7.73\nDilution in net tangible book value per share to investors purchasing from holders of Placement Agent Warrants $ 11.855\nThe table and discussion above are based on 1,234,672 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and excludes.\n● 25,939 shares of common stock issuable as of the date hereof upon the exercise of common stock warrants outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $44.83 per\nshare;\n● 156,334 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options outstanding at a weighted-average exercise price of $13.20 per share; and\n● 141,303 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2022 Successor Equity Incentive Plan.\nTo the extent that any outstanding options are exercised, new options or shares of restricted stock are issued under our equity incentive plans, or we otherwise issue additional\nshares of common stock in the future, at a price less than the public offering price, there will be further dilution to the investors. In addition, we may choose to raise additional\ncapital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional\ncapital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\n12\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into the Warrant Inducement Agreement with the Investor Selling Stockholder of Existing Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock\nissued in a private placement offering that closed on July 14, 2023. Pursuant to the Warrant Inducement Agreement, the Investor Selling Stockholder of the Existing Warrants\nagreed to exercise for cash the Existing Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 285,715 shares of common stock, at the adjusted exercise price of $16.50 per share (reduced\nfrom the initial exercise price of $26.25 per share). The offer and resale of the shares of common stock underlying the Existing Warrants (the “Existing Warrant Shares”) have been\nregistered pursuant to our Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Registration Statement on Form S-1 on Form S-3 (File No. 333-273384) (the “Registration Statement”).\nIn consideration of the Investor Selling Stockholder’s agreement to exercise the Existing Warrants (the “Warrant Exercise”), at the reduced exercise price of $16.50 per share (which\nis above the Minimum Price, as defined in Rule 5635(d)(1)(A) of The Nasdaq Stock Market, plus $0.125 per new Common Warrant Share), in accordance with the Warrant\nInducement Agreement, we issued to the Investor Selling Stockholder new unregistered Series A-1 common stock purchase warrants (the “New Series A-1 Warrants”) to purchase\nan aggregate of 285,715 shares of common stock, equal to 100% of the number of Existing Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants and new unregistered\nSeries A-2 common stock purchase warrants (the “New Series A-2 Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 285,715 shares of common stock, equal to 100% of the number of\nExisting Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants, at an exercise price of $16.50 per share. The New Series A-1 Warrants and New Series A-2 Warrants are\nreferred to herein collectively as the “Common Warrants” and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Common Warrants are referred to herein collectively as the\n“Common Warrant Shares.” The New Series A-1 Warrants are immediately exercisable for a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance and the New Series A-2 Warrants are\nimmediately exercisable for a term of 18 months from the date that the Resale Registration Statement (hereinafter defined) has been declared effective by the SEC. The Common\nWarrants and the Common Warrant Shares were issued in a private placement and were not registered under the Securities Act, and were instead offered pursuant to the exemption\nprovided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder.\nThe transactions contemplated by the Warrant Inducement Agreement closed on November 4, 2024 (the “Closing Date”). We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately\n$4.7 million for the exercise of the Existing Warrants, before deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from the\nWarrant Exercise for our pivotal Phase 3 trial and partnering activities.\nWe agreed in the Warrant Inducement Agreement to file a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the resale of the Common Warrant Shares (the “Resale Registration\nStatement”) as soon as practicable (and in any event within 30 calendar days following the date of the Warrant Inducement Agreement), and to use commercially reasonable efforts\nto have such Resale Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC within 60 days following the date of the Warrant Inducement Agreement (or 90 days following the date of\nthe Warrant Inducement Agreement in the event of a “limited review” or “full review” by the SEC) and to keep such Resale Registration Statement effective at all times until the\nInvestor Selling Stockholder does not own any Common Warrants or Common Warrant Shares. We are filing the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part to\nregister the Common Warrant Shares and to fulfill our obligation to file the Resale Registration Statement.\nPursuant to the Warrant Inducement Agreement, we have agreed, with certain limited exceptions (including the filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a\npart), for 60 days following the Closing Date, not to issue any shares of common stock or Common Stock Equivalents (as defined in the Common Warrants) or to file any\nregistration statement. We have also agreed not to enter into a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Warrant Inducement Agreement) for a period of one year following the\nClosing Date.\nWainwright served as our exclusive placement agent in connection with the Warrant Exercise and other transactions described in the Warrant Inducement Agreement. Pursuant to\nthe terms of an engagement letter, dated September 18, 2024, by and between us and Wainwright (the “Engagement Letter”), we: (i) paid to Wainwright a cash fee equal to 7.0% of\nthe aggregate gross proceeds received from the Investor Selling Stockholder upon exercise of the Existing Warrants, and (ii) issued to Wainwright, or its designees, Placement\nAgent Warrants to purchase up to 18,571 Placement Agent Warrant Shares, which is equal to 6.5% of the aggregate number of Existing Warrant Shares. The Placement Agent\nWarrants have substantially the same terms as the New Series A-1 Warrants, except that the Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $20.625 per share, which is equal\nto 125% of the exercise price of the Common Warrants.\n13\nTerms of the Common Warrants\nThe Common Warrants are immediately exercisable. The New Series A-1 Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance and the New Series A-2 Warrants will\nexpire on the 18-month anniversary of the date that the Resale Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. If at any time after the 60-day anniversary of the\nClosing Date, a registration statement registering the issuance of the Common Warrant Shares under the Securities Act is not effective or available, the holder may, in its sole\ndiscretion, elect to exercise the Common Warrants through a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of shares of common\nstock determined according to the formula set forth in the Common Warrants.\nThe exercise price of the Common Warrants, and the number of Common Warrant Shares, will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization,\nreorganization or similar transaction, as described in the Common Warrants.\nA holder of Common Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Common Warrants if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of\n4.99% (or, upon election of the holder, 9.99%) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership\nis determined in accordance with the terms of the Common Warrants. However, a holder may increase or decrease such percentage, provided that any increase will not be effective\nuntil the 61st day after such election.\nIn the event of a Fundamental Transaction (as such term is defined in the Common Warrants), then the successor entity will succeed to, and be substituted for us, and may\nexercise every right and power that we may exercise and will assume all of our obligations under the Common Warrants with the same effect as if such successor entity had been\nnamed in the warrant itself. If holders of common stock are given a choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then a holder of the\nCommon Warrants shall be given the same choice as to the consideration it receives upon any exercise of the Common Warrants following such Fundamental Transaction. In\naddition, the successor entity, at the request of holders of Common Warrants, will be obligated to purchase any unexercised portion of the Common Warrants in accordance with\nthe terms thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the holders of the Common Warrants have the right to require us or a successor\nentity to purchase the Common Warrant for cash in the amount of the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Common Warrants) of the unexercised portion of the Common\nWarrants concurrently with or within 30 days following the consummation of a Fundamental Transaction. However, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction which is not in our\ncontrol, including a Fundamental Transaction not approved by our board of directors, the holders of the Common Warrants will only be entitled to receive from us or our successor\nentity, as of the date of consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the\nunexercised portion of the Common Warrant that is being offered and paid to the holders of common stock in connection with the Fundamental Transaction, whether that\nconsideration is in the form of cash, stock or any combination of cash and stock, or whether the holders of common stock are given the choice to receive alternative forms of\nconsideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction.\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Common Warrants or by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of common stock, the holder of a Common Warrant will not have the\nrights or privileges of a holder of common stock, including any voting rights, until the holder exercises such warrant.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Warrant Inducement Agreement, the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants do not purport to be complete and are qualified in\ntheir entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and are incorporated by\nreference herein.\n14\nSELLING STOCKHOLDERS\nThe common stock being offered by the Selling Stockholders are those issuable to the Selling Stockholders upon exercise of the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent\nWarrants. For additional information regarding the issuances of the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants, see “Description of the Private Placement” elsewhere in\nthis prospectus. We are registering the shares of common stock in order to permit the Selling Stockholders to offer the shares of common stock for resale from time to time. Except\nfor the ownership of the Existing Warrants, the Common Warrants and/or the Placement Agent Warrants, as applicable, the Selling Stockholders have not had any material\nrelationship with us within the past three years, except that each of Michael Vasinkevich, Noam Rubinstein, Craig Schwabe and Charles Worthman are associated persons of\nWainwright, which served as our placement agent in connection with the Warrant Inducement as well as the private placement transaction consummated on July 14, 2023 (the\n“2023 Private Placement”), pursuant to which the Existing Warrants were issued, for which Wainwright received compensation, consisting of a cash fee of 7.5% of the aggregate\ngross proceeds raised in the 2023 Private Placement, of which 25% was paid to a financial advisor, a management fee equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the 2023 Private\nPlacement, reimbursement of certain expenses and legal fees, and the issuance of warrants (the “2023 PA Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 18,572 shares of common stock.\nIn addition, on March 11, 2024, we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement with Wainwright relating to the sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate\noffering price of up to $5,143,730 from time to time through or to Wainwright, acting as sales agent or principal, pursuant to which Wainwright is entitled to receive compensation\nof 3.0% of the gross sales price of all shares sold thereunder. Information regarding the compensation paid to Wainwright in connection with the Warrant Inducement is described\nunder the section “Description of the Private Placement” included elsewhere in this prospectus.\nThe table below lists the Selling Stockholders and other information regarding the beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock by each of the Selling Stockholders. The\nsecond column lists the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the Selling Stockholders, based on its ownership of the shares of common stock, the Common\nWarrants and the Placement Agent Warrants, as of November 13, 2024, assuming exercise of the Common Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants held by the Selling\nStockholders on that date, without regard to any limitations on exercises. As of November 13, 2024, we had 1,658,771 shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of the\nbeneficial ownership calculations in the Selling Stockholder table below, the 123,715 shares of common stock being held in abeyance by our transfer agent are considered\noutstanding which would increase our outstanding shares of common stock to 1,782,486 shares.\nThe third column lists the maximum number of shares of common stock being offered by this prospectus by the Selling Stockholders.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Warrant Inducement Agreement with the Investor Selling Stockholder and an agreement with Wainwright, this prospectus generally covers the\nresale of the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants, determined as if the outstanding\nCommon Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants were exercised in full as of the trading day immediately preceding the date this registration statement was initially filed with the\nSEC, each as of the trading day immediately preceding the applicable date of determination and all subject to adjustment as provided in the registration right agreement, without\nregard to any limitations on the exercise of the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants. The fourth and fifth columns assume the sale of all of the shares offered by\nthe Selling Stockholders pursuant to this prospectus.\nUnder the terms of the Common Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants, the Selling Stockholders may not exercise the Common Warrants or the Placement Agent Warrants\nto the extent such exercise would cause such Selling Stockholder, together with its affiliates and attribution parties, to beneficially own a number of shares of common stock that\nwould exceed 4.99%, of our then outstanding common stock following such exercise, excluding for purposes of such determination shares of common stock issuable upon exercise\nof such warrants which have not been exercised. The number of shares in the second and fourth columns do not reflect this limitation. The Selling Stockholders may sell all, some\nor none of their shares in this offering.

The\nCommon Warrants are subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 9.99%, which restricts the Investor Selling Stockholder from exercising that portion of the warrants that\nwould result in the Investor Selling Stockholder and its affiliates owning, after exercise, a number of shares of common stock in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation.\nThe number of shares set forth in the above table does not reflect the application of this limitation. The securities are directly held by Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd., a\nCayman Islands exempted company (the “Master Fund”), and may be deemed to be beneficially owned by: (i) Armistice Capital, LLC (“Armistice Capital”), as the investment\nmanager of the Master Fund; and (ii) Steven Boyd, as the Managing Member of Armistice Capital.

The Common Warrants and the 2023 PA Warrants are subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99%, which restricts\nthese Selling Stockholders from exercising that portion of the warrants that would result in each Selling Stockholder and its affiliates owning, after exercise, a number of shares\nof common stock in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation. H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC acquired the Placement Agent Warrants and the 2023 PA Warrants in the\nordinary course of business and, at the time the Placement Agent Warrants and the 2023 PA Warrants were acquired, H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC had no agreement or\nunderstanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute such securities.\n16\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\nEach Selling Stockholder of the securities and any of its pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or\nnegotiated prices. The Selling Stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:\n● ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;\n● block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;\n● purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;\n● an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;\n● privately negotiated transactions;\n● settlement of short sales;\n● in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated price per security;\n● through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;\n● a combination of any such methods of sale; or\n● any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.\nThe Selling Stockholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 or any other exemption from registration under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.\nBroker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the\nSelling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement\nto this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2121; and in the case of a principal\ntransaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA Rule 2121.\nIn connection with the sale of the securities or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions,\nwhich may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities short and deliver\nthese securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter\ninto option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or\nother financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as\nsupplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\nThe Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act\nin connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be\ndeemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each Selling Stockholders has informed us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or\nunderstanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities.\nWe are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities.\nWe agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the date on which the Common Warrants and the Common Warrant Shares have been sold. Under applicable rules and\nregulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the\ncommon stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to\napplicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the common\nstock by the Selling Stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a\ncopy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\n17\nLEGAL MATTERS\nThe validity of the shares of our common stock being offered by this prospectus have been passed upon for us by Blank Rome LLP, New York, New York.\nEXPERTS\nWithumSmith+Brown, PC, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of Cadrenal Therapeutics, Inc. included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the period from January 25, 2022 (inception) to December 31, 2022, as set forth in\ntheir report, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement.
