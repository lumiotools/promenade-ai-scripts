BUSINESS\n\nRoss Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashionstores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS®. \n\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,764 locations in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of February 3, 2024. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. Ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households. \n\nWe also operate 345 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 22 states as of February 3, 2024. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood, and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than Ross customers. \n\nThe merchant, store field, and distribution operations for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS are separate. The two chains share certain corporate and support services.\n\nBoth our Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS brands target value-conscious customers. The decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer profiles. We believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories, in organized and easy-to-shop store environments. \n\nOur mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:\n\n•Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.\n\n•Meet customer needs on a local basis.\n\n•Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.\n\n•Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.\n\nWe refer to our fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 as fiscal 2023 which was a 53-week year. Our fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 are referred to as fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, each of which were 52-week years.\n\nMerchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing\n\nWe seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is on trend and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a treasure-hunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home.\n\n3\n\nMerchandising. Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe merchandise with nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell.\n\nWe have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we may offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection within each classification, with a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. Our merchandise offerings include, but are not limited to, apparel, footwear, accessories, small furniture, home accents, bed and bath, beauty, toys, luggage, gourmet food, cookware, jewelry and watches, and pet accessories.\n\nPurchasing. We have a large network of merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers.\n\nWe believe our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for Ross, and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.\n\nUnlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that vendors or manufacturers provide promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For most orders, delivery is made to one of our distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases.\n\nThe merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer and brand overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season (“close-out” purchases), and production direct from brands and factories (“upfront” purchases). We also source merchandise under in-house brands or vendor brands. Upon receipt, merchandise can be shipped to stores in-season or can be stored in our warehouses as packaway merchandise.\n\nPackaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately 40% of total inventories as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023.\n\nOur primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation’s two largest apparel markets. We also operate a smaller buying office located in Boston. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently, sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2023, we had over 900 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, and each includes merchandise management, buyers, and assistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average eight years of experience, including merchandising positions with other retailers. We expect to make continued investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.\n\n4\n\nThe off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.\n\nPricing. We sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular prices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.\n\nOur pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value. Our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale on a weekly basis, as well as at the end of fashion seasons, to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores.\n\nStores\n\nAs of February 3, 2024, we operated a total of 2,109 stores comprised of 1,764 Ross stores and 345 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, our real estate strategy is to cluster Ross stores with the objective to increase our market penetration and to benefit from economies of scale in advertising, distribution, field management, and other overhead. When evaluating a new store location, we consider factors such as the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions. Where possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time and at reasonable costs in a given market. We do the same for dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\n\nWe believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS is our organized and easy-to-shop in-store environment which allows customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure-hunt shopping experience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing rooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. We enable our customers to select among sizes and styles through prominent category and sizing markers. Our stores have shopping carts and/or baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing.\n\nWe accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered) returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nConsistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the factors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies; economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and purchasing decisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats.\n\n5\n\nInformation Systems\n\nWe continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years. Current initiatives include continued enhancements to our stores, supply chain, merchandising, and cybersecurity systems. These initiatives support future growth, the execution and achievement of our plans, ongoing stability, and compliance. \n\nDistribution\n\nWe operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores. These distribution centers are large, highly automated, and built to suit our specific off-price business model. We also operate warehouse facilities for packaway storage. \n\nWe utilize a combination of owned, leased, and third-party cross-dock facilities to distribute merchandise from distribution centers to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location.\n\nWe believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing and storage capacity to support our near term store growth plans. Information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found in ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n\nMarketing and Advertising\n\nWe use a variety of marketing and advertising media to communicate our value proposition to customers—savings off the same brands carried at department or specialty stores every day. This includes a mix of traditional and streaming television, digital channels, and new store grand openings. We continue to shift our marketing and advertising to digital channels, including social media, digital video, and digital audio, to reflect changes in media consumption. We believe that a mix of channels is important to reach our customers.\n\nTrademarks\n\nOur principal trademarks are ROSS®, Ross Dress For Less®, and dd’s DISCOUNTS®, which are registered in the United States and in certain other countries. We expect our rights in these trademarks to endure in locations where we use them for as long as our use continues.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs of February 3, 2024, we had approximately 108,000 total associates, which includes both full- and part-time associates in our stores, distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices. Approximately 85% of these associates worked in our retail stores. Additionally, we hire temporary associates, especially during peak seasons. We have no associates that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers the relationship between the Company and our associates to be strong.\n\nOur associates play essential roles in not only delivering great values to our customers but also evolving and strengthening the culture at Ross. We strive to have a workforce that reflects our values, supports our business growth, and strengthens our communities. Throughout our organization, we recognize and appreciate the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing our associates and we have a number of key programs to do so. \n\nOur culture. Values start with our people. At Ross, we value integrity, accountability, respect, learning, and humility. We strive to do what is right for our associates, customers, and the communities we serve. We are also committed to promoting an inclusive culture and work environment in which our associates are treated with dignity and respect.\n\n6\n\nTalent development. The professional growth of our associates is important to our success as a business. We identify and enumerate key competencies we believe are critical to our ability to execute our business model and deliver the values our customers expect. We utilize these competencies in the hiring, development, evaluation, and future planning of our teams. We provide training opportunities to help associates grow and build their careers. Our associates, managers, and executives may participate in technical and leadership development activities. We support associates interested in leadership roles by offering opportunities to gain experience and build the skills necessary to advance within the Company.\n\nCompensation and benefits. We are dedicated to providing our associates with competitive pay and benefits, a safe working environment, recognition for achievements, channels to share opinions and ideas, opportunities to give back, support for educational advancement, and merchandise and other discounts. We are also continuing to invest in our associates with programs that assist with physical, emotional, and financial wellness.\n\nDiversity, equality, and inclusion. We care about our associates and the communities we serve. We are committed to building diverse teams and an inclusive culture that respects, values, and celebrates the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of those who work and shop with us. We are focused on executing strategies to support our commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion.\n\nCommunity and social impact. We provide our associates the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact through various programs such as our matching gift program, volunteer time off for eligible associates, and a scholarship program for our associates and their dependents. \n\nCompetition\n\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we continue to make strategic investments in our organization. We also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product to our stores. We operate in an attractive sector of retail which offers both value and convenience. We believe that we are well-positioned within the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry to compete based on these factors.\n\nNevertheless, the retail apparel and home fashion markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging and rapidly changing macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for our business from online retailers, department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources. The retail apparel and home-related businesses may become even more competitive in the future. \n\nSeasonality\n\nAlthough our off-price business is subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, sales are generally higher during the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nThe internet address for our corporate website is www.rossstores.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and any amendments to those reports are made available free of charge on or through the Investors section of our corporate website, promptly after being electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications, including those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events, our projected future financial performance, operations, competitive position, and our planned growth, that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and from our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements.”\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the following:\n\nMACROECONOMIC AND RETAIL INDUSTRY BUSINESS RISKS\n\nWe are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income, and also increase our costs. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, and other accompanying economic impacts from geopolitical conflicts, public health crises (such as pandemics), or other external events may continue to have significant negative effects on our costs and on consumer confidence, shopping behavior, and spending, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\n\nConsumer spending levels and shopping behaviors for the merchandise we sell are affected by many external macroeconomic factors. Currently, elevated inflation is affecting consumer demand for our products and increasing our costs. Factors such as higher fuel and energy costs, rising food prices, high interest rates, increases in housing costs, the size and timing of government stimulus programs, wage rates, unemployment levels, income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, and the resulting effects on consumers’ disposable income and consumer confidence in future economic conditions all have an impact on consumer spending habits for our merchandise.\n\nOngoing geopolitical conflicts may continue to cause various adverse macroeconomic effects, including supply chain disruptions, market volatility and uncertainty, inflation, increases in fuel and energy costs, rising food prices, and depressed financial markets.\n\nOur business and operations were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years, and could be affected by another public health event in the future. The extent and duration of impacts from future public health crisis on our business and our financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the severity, location, and duration of the issue, efforts to mitigate the resulting economic disruptions, and the related impact on consumer confidence, shopping behavior, and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such impacts have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, financial results, and our capital resources.\n\nElevated inflation, geopolitical conflicts, bank failures, pandemics, and other potential, adverse developments, could reduce demand for our merchandise, increase our cost of goods, freight, and payroll, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins. All of our stores are located in the United States and its territories, so we are especially susceptible to changes in the U.S. economy.\n\n10\n\nCompetitive pressures in the apparel and home-related merchandise retailing industry are high.\n\nThe retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented, as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase in the future. There are limited economic barriers for others to enter the off-price retail sector. We compete for customers, associates, store locations, and merchandise with many other local, regional, and national retailers, traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, other off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. Our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing, business strategies, and promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. The substantial sales growth in e-commerce has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models, and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives. Intense pressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, or a failure to effectively execute our off-price model, could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause us to take greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins.\n\nUnexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and home-related merchandise could adversely affect us.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively buy and sell merchandise that meets customer demand. We work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences, and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs. It is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the United States and its territories. Although our off-price business model provides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise mix to ever-changing consumer tastes, our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences, particularly in our newer geographic markets. Failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends, preferences, and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise, and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores.\n\nUnseasonable weather and prolonged, extreme temperatures, as well as events such as storms, affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop, and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise. Among other things, weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily, thereby reducing store traffic. Even if stores are not closed, many customers may be unable to go, or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather. As a result, adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to lower-than-expected sales and cause us to increase our markdowns, which may negatively affect our sales and margins.\n\nWe may experience volatility in sales and earnings. \n\nOur business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and back-to-school seasons, weather, and other factors. Although our off-price business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time, which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins. Significant operating expenses, such as rent expense and associate wages, do not adjust proportionately with our sales. If sales in a certain period are lower than our plans, we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\n\nWe depend on the market availability, quantity, and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts, and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices.\n\nOpportunistic buying, lean inventory levels, and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our off-price business strategy. Maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins. Our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants, who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season. Our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous, sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers. To the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess \n\n11\n\ninventory, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. To the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced. Because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries, constraints on the availability of shipping capacity, changes in transportation costs or in U.S. tariffs, trade relationships or tax policies, geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, or public health issues such as pandemics, that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods, could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships. Shortages, delays, or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality, value-priced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins.\n\nOur inability to continually attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our off-price retail strategies along with labor shortages, increased turnover, or increased labor costs could adversely affect our operating results. \n\nLike other retailers, we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization, management, stores, distribution centers, and other key areas. Many of our retail store associates are in entry level or part-time positions with elevated rates of turnover. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, potential labor organizing activities, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits. \n\nAny increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or, if we fail to pay competitive wages, may result in increased turnover. Excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding, hiring, and training new associates. If we cannot hire enough qualified associates, or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from third-party providers, especially during our peak seasons, our operations could be negatively impacted.\n\nBecause of the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must also attract, train, and retain our key associates across the Company, especially within our buying organization. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth, operations, or financial position. \n\nWe need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth. \n\nSuccessful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas. We compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations. For the purpose of identifying locations, we rely on consumer demographics. While we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations, we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy. Time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations. We may not be able to open new stores or, if opened, operate those new stores profitably. Construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results. New stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores. If we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets. \n\nTo achieve growth, we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets. \n\nOur growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and in new geographic regions. There are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets. Stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy, advertising, or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes, and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in marketing, advertising, and promotional activity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate, and retain qualified associates.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries.\n\nRisks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas, economic and supply chain uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including shipping capacity limitations, cost increases, inflation, \n\n12\n\nrecession, and exchange rate fluctuations), foreign government regulations, employment and labor matters, concerns relating to human rights, working conditions, and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced, transparency of sourcing and supply chains, exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues, consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise, geopolitical conflict (including wars and fears of war), political unrest, natural disasters, regulations to address climate change, and trade restrictions.\n\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell (even when we purchase it domestically, often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor) is originally manufactured in other countries. In addition, we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in Asia (including China). We also buy products that originate from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives. Although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors. When we are the importer of record, we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer.\n\nTo the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products, any event causing a disruption, delay, or increase in the cost of imports, including the imposition of import or other restrictions such as product detention, war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues such as pandemics could adversely affect our business. The flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by global shipping capacity limitations, labor stoppages, or by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured. Trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. We cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced, or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments or the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions.\n\nOur ability to effectively advertise and market our business could impact customer traffic and demand for our merchandise.\n\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands, and the location of our stores. Although we use marketing and advertising mediums to attract customers to our stores, particularly through traditional and streaming television, digital channels, and new store grand openings, our competitors may spend more or use different approaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively, or could require increased expenditures, any of which could adversely affect sales or increase costs.\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nIn order to achieve our planned gross margins, we must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory shortage. As a result of changes in shopping behaviors due to factors such as inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility of future pandemics, and disruptions to supply chains and store operations, we are at risk for inventory imbalances and the potential for higher than normal levels of markdowns to sell through our inventory, increased cost of goods, and for lost sales due to insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, any of which would negatively affect our sales, gross margin, and operating results.\n\nWe purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans. If our actual demand is lower than our sales plans, we may experience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, resulting in decreased profit margins. Inflation may continue to cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned, and we may not be able to sell the inventory to our customers at correspondingly increased prices, resulting in decreased profit margins. We also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales opportunities. As evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, future pandemics and accompanying economic impacts may change shopping behavior so that our predictions and sales plans become less accurate, and that may lead us to have higher than usual levels of slow-moving or non-salable inventory at our prior planned price levels. We would then need to reduce our selling prices aggressively and progressively in order to clear out that inventory, which would result in decreased profit margins or losses on sales of that inventory, and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\n\n13\n\nAs a regular part of our business, we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans, but it typically remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory. If we make packaway purchases that do not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores, we could have significant inventory markdowns. Changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow. Although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory, both when in storage and once distributed to our stores, we may have damaged, lost, or stolen inventory (called “shortage”) in higher amounts than we forecast, which would result in write-offs, lost sales, and reduced margins.\n\nInformation or data security breaches, including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems (including malware intrusion, data exfiltration, identity theft, and other types of cybersecurity threats), could disrupt our operations, result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of our confidential and valuable business information or credit card and other customer information, and could adversely affect our business, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and create significant legal exposure.\n\nLike other large retailers, we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process, transmit, and store payment card and other personal and confidential information, and to provide information or data security for those transactions. Many of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals, and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards, are controlled by the banking and payment card industry, not by us. Cybercriminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other transaction processing information systems to misappropriate customer or business information, including but not limited to credit/debit card, personnel, or trade information. \n\nCybercriminals (including state-sponsored actors) may attempt to penetrate our information systems, including supply chain and logistics systems, to deprive us from access to necessary business information and to disrupt our operations, as part of so-called “ransomware” extortion activity or otherwise. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs.\n\nDespite security measures we have in place, and our efforts to prevent, monitor, and mitigate attacks and errors, our facilities and systems (or those of third-party service providers we utilize or connect to) may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, phishing, ransomware attacks, and similar fraudulent attacks, or other similar events. It is also possible that an associate within our Company, or at a third party we do business with, may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information. The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals, the increased potential for cyberattacks, the advances in computer capabilities and artificial intelligence, and remote access increases these risks. A breach of our information or data security, a system shut down or other response we may take, or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a system breach and a loss of personal or business information, could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence, violation (or alleged violation) of applicable laws (including laws relating to consumer data protection and privacy, and required notifications of data security breaches), and expose us to civil claims, litigation, and regulatory action, and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations. \n\nDisruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n\nVarious information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business. We depend on the integrity, continuous availability, and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores, track inventory flow, manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics, generate performance and financial reports, and support merchandising decisions.\n\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose sound investments and implement them at the right pace. The risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken. An excessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology. Poorly targeting opportunities, failing to make good investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could \n\n14\n\ndamage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide us with the anticipated benefits, or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.\n\nOur information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as severe storms, fires, earthquakes, floods, acts of terrorism, and design or usage errors by our associates or by third parties. If our information systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs. Such disruptions may result from public health issues such as pandemics, cyberattacks, damage or destruction to our distribution centers, weather-related events, natural disasters, trade restrictions, tariffs, third-party strikes or ineffective cross-dock operations, work stoppages or slowdowns, shipping capacity constraints, supply or shipping interruptions, or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\n\nDamage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\n\nOur reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity. Any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by, or situations involving, our vendors (or their contractors or subcontractors), the landlords for our stores, or our associates outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. Similarly, our responses to events or crises and our position (or perceived lack of position) on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, such as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, diversity, equality, and inclusion (“DE&I”), responsible sourcing, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation.\n\nThe use of social media and other online platforms, including blogs, applications, websites, and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, continues to increase. The availability of information (whether correct or erroneous) on social media and other online platforms is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Many social media and other online platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could negatively affect our sales, diminish customer trust, reduce employee morale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\n\nTo support our continuing operations, our new store and distribution center growth plans and other capital investment plans, our quarterly dividends, our debt repayments, and our stock repurchase program, we must maintain sufficient liquidity.\n\nWe depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities, and to finance our operations, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels, and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Disruptions to our operations may occur, nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities, our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected. \n\nIf our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, if we do not properly allocate our capital resources to maximize returns, our operations, cash flows, and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected.\n\n15\n\nA pandemic, or natural or man-made disaster in a region where we have a concentration of stores, offices, or a distribution center could harm our business. \n\nWe have a concentration of store locations in the states of California, Texas, and Florida; together those states include almost 50% of our stores. More than half of our distribution center and warehouse capacity, approximately 22% of our stores, and our corporate headquarters, are located in California. Natural or other disasters, such as wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or other extreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions, and acts of war or terrorism, or public health issues (such as pandemics), in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain, or could shut down, damage, or destroy our stores or distribution facilities.\n\nWe are subject to impacts from instances of damage to our stores and losses of merchandise accompanying protests or demonstrations, which may result in temporary store closures.\n\nIn recent years, there have been demonstrations and protests in cities throughout the United States. While they have generally been peaceful, in some locations they have been accompanied by violence, damage to retail stores, and the loss of merchandise. While generally subject to coverage by insurance, the repairs of damage to our stores and replacement of lost merchandise may increase our costs and temporarily disrupt store operations, and we may incur increased operating costs for additional security. Governmental authorities in affected cities and regions may take action in an effort to protect people and property while permitting lawful and non-violent protests, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, which may be disruptive to our operations. These activities, governmental responses, and resulting media coverage may also harm consumer confidence and perceptions of personal well-being and security, which may negatively affect shopping behavior and our sales.\n\nCOMPLIANCE, REGULATORY, AND LEGAL RISKS\n\nConsumer problems or legal issues involving the quality, safety, or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation, result in lost sales, and/or increase our costs. \n\nVarious governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell. These regulations and related laws frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. Because of our opportunistic buying strategies, we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors we have not previously dealt with. Although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws, any non-compliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls, make certain products unsalable, or require us to incur significant compliance costs.\n\nWe require our vendors (for both import and domestic purchasing) to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct, compliance, and other requirements, including those relating to environmental, employment and labor (including wages and working conditions), health, safety, and anti-bribery standards. From time to time, our vendors, their contractors, or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to promote compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise, and to monitor the compliance of our suppliers, this does not guarantee that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate (or not allegedly violate) such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing non-compliance (or alleged non-compliance) with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to claims and liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nRegardless of fault, any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer (particularly products such as food and children’s items), issues with the authenticity of merchandise, or our inability or that of our vendors, to comply on a timely basis with laws and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, result in lost sales, inventory write-offs, uninsured product liability or other legal claims, penalties or losses, merchandise recalls, and increased costs.\n\nAn adverse outcome in various legal, regulatory, or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs.\n\nAs an ordinary part of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, tax audits, and/or other legal matters. These may include lawsuits, inquiries, demands, or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs, including those relating to employment and employee benefits (including classification, employment rights, discrimination, harassment, wage and hour, and retaliation), workplace safety, \n\n16\n\nsecurities, real estate, tort, commercial, consumer protection, privacy, product compliance and safety, advertising, environmental, comparative pricing, product labeling, intellectual property, tax, escheat, and whistle-blower claims. We continue to be involved in a number of employment-related lawsuits, including class/representative actions which are primarily in California.\n\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local rules and regulations in the United States, and to various international laws, which change from time to time. These legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, including the cost of health care, workforce management and employee benefits, minimum wages, advertising, comparative pricing, import/export, sourcing and manufacturing, data protection (including customer and associate data privacy, choice, and notification rights), intellectual property, and others. If we fail to comply (or are alleged not to comply) with any of these requirements, we may be subject to fines, settlements, penalties, or other costs. In addition, an adverse outcome (or the adverse publicity from the claims) in any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal, state, and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims. Actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes. In addition, applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition.\n\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding apparel and home-related merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business. \n\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries. The U.S. government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies, including those with China. This exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships, or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our profitability.\n\n17\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n18\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY RISK\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\n\nWe have a cybersecurity program that is intended to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to our business. Our program includes policies and procedures for detection, assessment, response, mitigation, remediation, and reporting of cybersecurity incidents and threats. Overall, our cybersecurity program is a strategic component of our company-wide risk management framework and activities. \n\nOur cybersecurity program is led by our Information Technology (IT) team. The IT team is principally responsible for developing, managing, and implementing our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, maintaining and implementing our incident response plans, selecting and implementing security controls, providing cybersecurity training, performing ongoing threat analysis, and responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents. The cybersecurity program also draws upon a combination of industry frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, that are designed to help companies measure their security posture, reduce cybersecurity risks, and provide guidance for implementing effective security controls. \n\nOur risk management approach and processes for cybersecurity extend to assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers, by employing vetting processes, including the conducting of security assessments and monitoring activities, to verify that third-party service providers adhere to our policies and contractual requirements. \n\nIn addition, we engage and work with a range of third-party advisors, including cybersecurity consultants, legal counsel, and auditors, to help us assess, test, and otherwise assist in the development and review of our cybersecurity processes. These relationships enable us to benefit from specialized knowledge and insights to help inform our cybersecurity strategies. \n\nAs of April 1, 2024, to our knowledge, our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats or previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but there is no assurance that we will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or future incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nOur Board of Directors exercises general oversight of our risk management activities, including our cybersecurity program. With respect to risks related to cybersecurity, our Board of Directors has delegated the primary oversight responsibility to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, along with management, reports to the full Board of Directors on these matters throughout the year.\n\nThe Audit Committee receives quarterly cybersecurity reports and engages directly with our management team, including our Chief Capability Officer (CCO), Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), on cybersecurity risk management and related risk topics, including incident response and recovery protocols, associate trainings and awareness, recent Company and industry developments, and our related compliance programs and practices. Our cybersecurity program and practices are also evaluated through various internal and third-party audits and assessments, with the results reported to the Audit Committee. \n\nOur CIO and CISO are principally responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats, reporting to our CCO. They lead efforts to prevent, identify, detect, mitigate, and remediate material cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, including by receiving alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT systems. Together, our CIO and CISO have decades of experience in cybersecurity and in retail, including leadership experience in cybersecurity risk management, incident response and recovery, compliance, governance, IT systems and technology, and overall cyber defense methodologies. \n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nAt February 3, 2024, we operated a total of 2,109 stores, of which 1,764 were Ross stores in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 345 were dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 22 states.

Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of February 3, 2024. \n\nWe are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed against us may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal, state, and/or local laws. Actions against us are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.\n\nLike many retailers and other businesses, we have filed a lawsuit as plaintiff against various insurance companies with respect to our claims for insurance coverage for business interruption, property damage, and other losses that we have experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our suit was filed in Alameda County, California in December 2020. The proceedings are ongoing and remain subject to significant uncertainties.\n\nWe believe that the resolution of our currently pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nITEM 4.

RESERVED\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nOverview\n\nRoss Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS®. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,764 locations in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of February 3, 2024. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. We also operate 345 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 22 states as of February 3, 2024 that feature a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.\n\nOur primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. Although inflation has moderated during the past year, the cost of essentials remains elevated and continues to pressure our low-to-moderate income customers’ discretionary spending. We are closely monitoring market share trends for the off-price industry and we believe our share gains will continue to grow through continued focus on bringing value and convenience to our customers, despite the ongoing uncertainty in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments.\n\nWe believe our merchandising and operational strategies enable us to deliver the most competitive bargains available to meet our customers’ ongoing demand for quality branded goods for the family and home at compelling discounts every day. Our merchandising strategies include offering a wide assortment of quality branded bargains for our customers. We believe staying diligently focused on executing our merchandising strategies is an important driver of our ability to gain market share in fiscal 2024 and the long term.\n\nThe fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 is referred to as fiscal 2023 and was a 53-week year. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 are referred to as fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, and were 52-week years.\n\nThe discussion that follows relates to fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Discussion of fiscal 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022.\n\n26\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following table summarizes our financial results for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---  \nSales  \nSales (millions)| $| 20,377| $| 18,696 | $| 18,916   \nSales growth (decline)| 9.0%| (1.2)%| 50.9%  \nComparable store sales growth (decline)| 5%| 1| (4)%| 1| 13%| 2  \nCosts and expenses (as a percent of sales)  \nCost of goods sold| 72.7%| 74.6%| 72.5%  \nSelling, general and administrative| 16.0%| 14.8%| 15.2%  \nInterest (income) expense, net| (0.8)%| 0.0%| 0.4%  \nEarnings before taxes (as a percent of sales)| 12.1%| 10.6%| 11.9%  \nNet earnings (as a percent of sales)| 9.2%| 8.1%| 9.1%  \n1 Comparable stores are stores open for more than 14 complete months.  \n2 Amount shown is for fiscal 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”). Comparable store sales for this purpose represents sales from stores that were open at the end of fiscal 2019, less stores closed in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021.  \n  \nStores.Our long-term strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.\n\nTotal stores open at the end of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were 2,109, 2,015, and 1,923, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 increased by 5%, 5%, and 3% from the respective prior years. In fiscal 2023, we opened 97 new stores. Looking forward to 2024, we expect to open approximately 90 new stores. We continue to believe that consumers’ increased focus on value and convenience and the significant number of brick-and-mortar retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several years provide opportunities for us to gain market share.\n\nThe following table summarizes the stores opened and closed during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\nStore Count| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nRoss Dress for Less  \nBeginning of the period| 1,693| 1,628 | 1,585   \nOpened in the period| 72| 1| 71 | 44   \nClosed in the period| (1)| (6)| 2| (1)  \nTotal Ross Dress for Less stores end of period| 1,764| 1,693 | 1,628   \ndd’s DISCOUNTS  \nBeginning of the period| 322| 295 | 274   \nOpened in the period| 25| 28 | 21   \nClosed in the period| (2)| (1)| —   \nTotal dd’s DISCOUNTS stores end of period| 345| 322 | 295   \nTotal stores end of period| 2,109| 2,015 | 1,923   \n1 Includes the reopening of a store previously temporarily closed due to a weather event.  \n2 Includes the temporary closure of a store impacted by a weather event.  \n  \n27\n\nThe total selling square footage as of February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022 was 42.8 million, 41.4 million, and 39.9 million, respectively.\n\nSales. Sales for fiscal 2023 increased $1.7 billion, or 9.0%, compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the 5% increase in comparable store sales, the opening of 94 net new stores during fiscal 2023, and the impact of the 53rd week.\n\nOur sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n2023| 1| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nHome Accents and Bed and Bath| 26| %| 26 | %| 26 | %  \nLadies| 23| %| 24 | %| 25 | %  \nMen’s| 15| %| 15 | %| 14 | %  \nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Cosmetics| 15| %| 14 | %| 14 | %  \nShoes| 13| %| 12 | %| 12 | %  \nChildren’s| 8| %| 9 | %| 9 | %  \nTotal| 100| %| 100 | %| 100 | %  \n  \nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2023 increased $0.9 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the 5% comparable store sales increase, higher sales from the opening of 94 net new stores during fiscal 2023, higher incentive compensation expense, and the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by lower ocean and domestic freight costs.\n\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2023 decreased approximately 195 basis points from fiscal 2022 primarily due to a 160 basis point increase in merchandise margin mainly due to lower ocean freight costs, a 60 basis point decrease in domestic freight costs, 25 basis points of leverage in occupancy costs, and a 20 basis point decrease in distribution costs primarily due to the timing of packaway inventory carrying costs. Partially offsetting these items was a 70 basis point increase in buying costs primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense.\n\nWe expect lower merchandise margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2024 as we plan to offer more brands that are sharply priced throughout our stores. We expect this impact will be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, which is expected to return to target levels.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $508.4 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, higher store wages, the opening of 94 net new stores during fiscal 2023, and the impact of the 53rd week.\n\nSG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2023 increased by approximately 125 basis points compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher store wages.\n\nWe expect lower incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2024, which is expected to return to target levels.\n\nInterest (income) expense, net.In fiscal 2023, interest (income) expense, net improved by $167.0 million compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to increased interest income from higher interest rates.\n\n28\n\nThe table below shows the components of interest (income) expense, net for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nInterest expense on long-term debt| $| 84,596| $| 84,558 | $| 88,286   \nOther interest expense| 1,599| 1,668 | 1,351   \nCapitalized interest| (12,106)| (5,678)| (14,476)  \nInterest income| (238,207)| (77,706)| (833)  \nInterest (income) expense, net| $| (164,118)| $| 2,842 | $| 74,328   \n  \nTaxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was approximately 24%. Our effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance, location of new stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA made several changes to business tax provisions including a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The one percent excise tax does not impact our effective tax rate. \n\nNet earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2023 was higher than in fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold and higher interest income, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.\n\nEarnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023 was $5.56 compared to $4.38 in the prior year. Fiscal 2023 includes a per share benefit of approximately $0.20 from the 53rd week. The $1.18 increase in diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to a 24% increase in net earnings (which included a 4% impact from the 53rd week) and a 3% reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, primarily due to stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease costs, taxes, capital expenditures related to our new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs, pay dividends, and repay debt as it becomes due.\n\n($ millions)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nCash provided by operating activities| $| 2,514.5| $| 1,689.4 | $| 1,738.8   \nCash used in investing activities| (762.8)| (654.1)| (557.8)  \nCash used in financing activities| (1,428.5)| (1,405.4)| (1,152.4)  \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents| $| 323.2| $| (370.1)| $| 28.6   \n  \n29\n\nOperating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2022. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and an increase in deferred income taxes, partially offset by merchandise inventory payments and payment of fiscal 2021 incentive bonuses. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2021. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher merchandise inventory receipts net of accounts payable.\n\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher current year incentive compensation accruals combined with lower incentive compensation payments and higher net earnings, partially offset by lower accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory).\n\nAccounts payable leverage was 89% and 99% as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. The decrease in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by timing of inventory receipts and related payments versus last year. \n\nAs a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.\n\nChanges in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. Packaway inventory was 40% of total inventory at the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $762.8 million, $654.1 million, and $557.8 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and was related to our capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures include costs to build, expand, and improve distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems and buying and corporate offices.\n\nThe increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to the construction and build-out of new stores, the construction of distribution centers, including capital expenditures related to our new Buckeye, Arizona distribution center, and various information technology projects.\n\n30\n\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:\n\n($ millions)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nNew stores| $| 209.2| $| 170.9 | $| 124.9   \nExisting stores| 167.6| 147.6 | 103.3   \nInformation systems, corporate, and other| 80.0| 65.4 | 50.3   \nDistribution and transportation| 306.0| 270.2 | 279.3   \nTotal capital expenditures| $| 762.8| $| 654.1 | $| 557.8   \n  \nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are projected to be approximately $840 million. Our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are for investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth, including construction of our next distribution centers, investments in our information technology systems, costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices. We expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash. The increase in our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 is primarily driven by investments in our next distribution centers, information technology systems, existing store improvements, and various expenditures related to distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, primarily resulting from stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs and dividend payments.\n\nRevolving credit facilities. We have a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). As of February 3, 2024, we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, the $1.3 billion Credit Facility remained in place and available, and we were in compliance with the financial covenant. Refer to Note D: Debtin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nSenior notes. As of February 3, 2024, we had approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding unsecured Senior Notes.

In May 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock through fiscal 2022.\n\nIn March 2022, our Board of Directors approved a two-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of the Company’s common stock through fiscal 2023. This program replaced the previously approved $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, effective at the end of fiscal 2021 (at which time we had repurchased $650 million under the previous $1.5 billion program).\n\nIn March 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year program to repurchase up to $2.1 billion of the Company’s common stock through fiscal 2025.\n\nThe following table summarizes our stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\nFiscal Year| Shares repurchased(in millions)|  Average repurchaseprice| Amount repurchased(in millions)  \n---|---|---|---  \n2023| 8.2| $| 115.24| $| 950| 1  \n2022| 10.3 | $| 92.15 | $| 950   \n2021| 5.7 | $| 114.29 | $| 650   \n1 Amount excludes excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  \n  \nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, we also acquired 0.5 million shares of treasury stock in each year from our employee equity incentive plans for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $48.6 million, $48.9 million, and $57.3 million, respectively.\n\n31\n\nOn March 5, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3675 per common share, payable on March 29, 2024. \n\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.3350 per common share in February, May, August, and November 2023. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.3100 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2022 and a cash dividend of $0.2850 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2021.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, we paid dividends of $454.8 million, $431.3 million, and $405.1 million, respectively. \n\nShort-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank credit facility, and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations.\n\nWe ended fiscal 2023 with $4.9 billion of unrestricted cash balances, which were held primarily in overnight money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and government instruments across a highly diversified set of banks and other financial institutions. We also have $1.3 billion available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We estimate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows from operations, bank credit facility, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments, debt repayments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next 12 months.\n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of February 3, 2024:\n\nLess than1 year| Greater than 1 year| Total¹  \n---|---|---  \n($000)  \nRecorded contractual obligations:  \nSenior notes| $| 250,000 | $| 2,224,991 | $| 2,474,991   \nOperating leases| 723,031 | 2,656,418 | 3,379,449   \nNew York buying office ground lease2| 7,552 | 1,101,192 | 1,108,744   \nUnrecorded contractual obligations:  \nReal estate obligations3| 14,339 | 218,625 | 232,964   \nInterest payment obligations| 80,316 | 354,818 | 435,134   \nPurchase obligations4| 4,236,623 | 104,916 | 4,341,539   \nTotal contractual obligations| $| 5,311,861 | $| 6,660,960 | $| 11,972,821   \n1 We have a $56.0 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated.  \n2 Our New York buying office building is subject to a 99-year ground lease.  \n3 Minimum lease payments for operating leases signed that have not yet commenced.  \n4 Purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, transportation, information technology services, store fixtures and supplies, and maintenance contracts.  \n  \n32\n\nSupply chain finance program. We facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “program”) to provide certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell their receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. A third party administers the program; our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. We do not enter into financial agreements with the participating financial institutions in connection with the program. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program.\n\nAll outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts owed to participating financial institutions under the program and included in Accounts payable were $146.9 million and $119.2 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. We account for all payments made under the program as a reduction to operating cash flows in Accounts payable within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. We use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize some of our insurance obligations. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we had $2.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding and $60.8 million and $57.8 million, respectively, in a collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOther than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of February 3, 2024.\n\nOther\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting estimates describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates. \n\nMerchandise inventory.Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or net realizable value. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, transportation, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as determined through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our provision for shortage to be reliable. A five percent change in shortage rates as of February 3, 2024 would not have materially impacted our cost of goods sold in fiscal 2023.\n\nInsurance obligations.We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. A five percent increase or decrease in our insurance reserves would not have materially impacted our net earnings in fiscal 2023.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRefer to Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n33\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements regarding, without limitation, projected sales, costs, earnings, planned new store growth, capital expenditures, sustainability and carbon reduction targets, and other matters. These forward-looking statements reflect our then-current beliefs, plans, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and competitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “target,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “looking ahead,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\n\nFuture impact from inflation, high interest rates and interest rate increases, ongoing military conflicts and economic sanctions, public health crises, climate change, and other economic, regulatory, and industry trends that could potentially impact our revenue, profitability, operating conditions, and growth are difficult to predict. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations, plans, and projections. Refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts and plans are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given, and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of February 3, 2024.\n\nInterest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of February 3, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\n\nAs of February 3, 2024, we had outstanding seven series of unsecured Senior Notes. Interest that is payable on all series of our Senior Notes is based on fixed interest rates, and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates. \n\nWe receive interest on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.\n\nA hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments as of and for the year ended February 3, 2024. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near-term changes in interest rates to be material.\n\n34\n\nITEM 8.

accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.  \n  \n39\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNote A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBusiness.Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal 2023, the Company operated 1,764 Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) locations in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 345 dd’s DISCOUNTS® stores in 22 states. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores are supported by the Company’s headquarters, buying offices, and its network of distribution centers and warehouses.\n\nBasis of presentation and fiscal year.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, is referred to as fiscal 2023 which was a 53-week year. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, are referred to as fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, each of which were 52-week years.\n\nUse of accounting estimates.The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory, packaway and other inventory carrying costs, useful lives of fixed assets, insurance reserves, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and legal claims.\n\nSegment reporting.The Company has one reportable segment. The Company identifies its operating segments according to how the business activities are managed and evaluated. As of February 3, 2024, the Company identified two operating segments; Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. Each operating segment’s operations include only activities related to off-price retailing in stores throughout the United States. The Company determined that the two operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics and are therefore aggregated into one reportable segment.\n\nCash and cash equivalents.Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The institutions where these instruments are held could potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. The Company manages its risk associated with these instruments by primarily holding its cash and cash equivalents across a highly diversified set of banks and other financial institutions.\n\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash and cash equivalents serve as collateral for certain insurance obligations. These restricted funds are invested in bank deposits, money market mutual funds, and U.S. Government and agency securities, and cannot be withdrawn from the Company’s account without the prior written consent of the secured parties. The classification between current and long-term is based on the timing of expected payments of the obligations.\n\nThe Company uses standby letters of credit in addition to a funded trust to collateralize these insurance obligations. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash. As of February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022 we had $2.2 million, $2.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding and $60.8 million, $57.8 million, and $56.7 million, respectively, in a collateral trust.\n\n40\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the amounts shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 4,872,446| $| 4,551,876 | $| 4,922,365  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents included in:  \nPrepaid expenses and other| 14,489| 12,677 | 11,403  \nOther long-term assets| 48,506| 47,688 | 48,614  \nTotal restricted cash and cash equivalents| 62,995| 60,365 | 60,017  \nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents| $| 4,935,441| $| 4,612,241 | $| 4,982,382  \n  \nEstimated fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts payable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. Refer to Note B: Fair Value Measurementsand Note D: Debt for additional information.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $4.9 billion and $4.6 billion at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and include bank deposits and money market funds for which the fair value was determined using quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.\n\nMerchandise inventory.Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or net realizable value. The Company purchases inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix, seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Company’s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, transportation, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company’s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.\n\nCost of goods sold.In addition toproduct costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution, and freight expenses, as well as occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying, and distribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the Company’s distribution centers, warehouses, and cross-dock facilities.\n\nProperty and equipment.Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three years to 12 years for equipment, 20 years to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, and three years to seven years for computer software costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $419.4 million, $394.7 million, and $360.7 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company capitalizes interest during the construction period of facilities and during the development and implementation phase of software projects. Interest capitalized was $12.1 million, $5.7 million, and $14.5 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, the Company had $78.2 million, $71.0 million, and $47.3 million, respectively, of property and equipment purchased but not yet paid. These purchases are included in Property and Equipment and in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n41\n\nOther long-term assets.Other long-term assets as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consisted of the following:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nDeferred compensation (Note G)| $| 165,582| $| 155,496  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| 48,506| 47,688  \nOther| 29,141| 28,899  \nTotal| $| 243,229| $| 232,083  \n  \nImpairment of long-lived assets. Property and other long-term assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. For stores that are closed, the Company records an impairment charge, if appropriate, or accelerates depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. No material impairment charges were recorded during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. \n\nAccounts payable.Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of approximately $61.4 million and $110.6 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.\n\nSupply chain finance program. The Company facilitates a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “program”) to provide certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell their receivables due from the Company to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. A third-party bank administers the program. The Company’s responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with each supplier, regardless of whether a supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The Company is not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program and receives no financial incentives from the suppliers or the financial institutions. No guarantees are provided by the Company under the program and the Company’s rights and obligations to its suppliers are not affected by the program. The range of payment terms negotiated with a supplier is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program.\n\nAll outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for all payments made under the program as a reduction to operating cash flows in Accounts payable within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amounts owed to participating financial institutions under the program and included in Accounts payable were $146.9 million and $119.2 million as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\n\n42\n\nInsurance obligations.The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance and deductible reserves as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consisted of the following:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nWorkers’ compensation| $| 80,791| $| 80,275  \nGeneral liability| 47,663| 48,754  \nMedical plans| 8,145| 9,650  \nTotal| $| 136,599| $| 138,679  \n  \nWorkers’ compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in Accrued payroll and benefits and accruals for general liability are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nOther long-term liabilities.Other long-term liabilities as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consisted of the following:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nIncome taxes (Note F)| $| 56,045| $| 57,409  \nDeferred compensation (Note G)| 165,582| 155,496  \nOther| 10,756| 11,199  \nTotal| $| 232,383| $| 224,104  \n  \nLease accounting.As the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is the rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company’s lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Refer to Note E: Leases for additional information.\n\nRevenue recognition.The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of sales taxes collected and an allowance for estimated future returns. The Company recognizes allowances for estimated sales returns on a gross basis as a reduction to sales. The asset recorded for the expected recovery of merchandise inventory was $12.1 million, $11.8 million, and $10.5 million and the liability recorded for the refund due to the customer was $23.7 million, $23.1 million, and $20.3 million as of February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. Sales taxes collected that are outstanding and the allowance for estimated future returns are included in Accrued expenses and other and the asset for expected recovery of merchandise is included in Prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nSales of stored value cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. The Company’s stored value cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon historical redemption rates, a small percentage of stored value cards will never be redeemed, which represents breakage. Breakage is estimated and recognized as revenue based upon the historical pattern of customer redemptions. Breakage was not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n\n43\n\nThe following sales mix table disaggregates revenue by merchandise category for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n2023| 1| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nHome Accents and Bed and Bath| 26| %| 26 | %| 26 | %  \nLadies| 23| %| 24 | %| 25 | %  \nMen’s| 15| %| 15 | %| 14 | %  \nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Cosmetics| 15| %| 14 | %| 14 | %  \nShoes| 13| %| 12 | %| 12 | %  \nChildren’s| 8| %| 9 | %| 9 | %  \nTotal| 100| %| 100 | %| 100 | %  \n  \nStore pre-opening.Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.\n\nAdvertising.Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $67.7 million, $66.5 million, and $65.1 million, respectively.\n\nStock-based compensation.The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. Refer to Note C: Stock-Based Compensation, for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.\n\nTaxes on earnings.The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note F: Taxes on Earnings for additional information.\n\nTreasury stock.The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax withholding purposes related to vesting of equity plan awards.\n\nEarnings per share(“EPS”).The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan awards and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 there were 200, 11,100, and 3,500 weighted-average shares, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years. \n\n44\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:\n\nShares in (000s)| Basic EPS| Effect of dilutivecommon stockequivalents| DilutedEPS  \n---|---|---|---  \n2023  \nShares| 335,187| 2,246| 337,433  \nAmount| $| 5.59| $| (0.03)| $| 5.56  \n2022  \nShares| 343,452 | 1,770 | 345,222  \nAmount| $| 4.40 | $| (0.02)| $| 4.38  \n2021  \nShares| 351,496 | 2,238 | 353,734  \nAmount| $| 4.90 | $| (0.03)| $| 4.87  \n  \nRecently adopted accounting standards. In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, to enhance transparency about an entity’s use of supplier finance programs. The ASU requires enhanced and additional disclosures about the key terms of supplier finance programs including a description of where in the financial statements any related amounts are presented. The Company adopted ASU 2022-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on a retrospective basis, excluding the rollforward requirements which will be adopted in fiscal 2024 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nRecently issued accounting standards. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. It requires the Company to disclose disaggregated jurisdictional and categorical information for the tax rate reconciliation and the amount of income taxes paid as well as additional income tax related amounts. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNote B: Fair Value Measurements\n\nAccounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The inputs used to measure fair value include: Level 1, observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. This fair value hierarchy requires the Company to develop its own assumptions and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Corporate, U.S. government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because these securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.\n\n45\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial instruments as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 are as follows:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents (Level 1)| $| 4,872,446| $| 4,551,876  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1)| $| 62,995| $| 60,365  \n  \nThe underlying assets in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation program as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 (included in Other long-term assets and Other long-term liabilities) primarily consist of participant-directed money market, stock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement for funds with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) are as follows:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nNonqualified deferred compensation program (Level 1)| $| 165,582| $| 155,496  \n  \nNote C: Stock-Based Compensation\n\nFor fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nRestricted stock| $| 92,511| $| 85,092 | $| 72,210  \nPerformance awards| 48,584| 32,484 | 57,582  \nEmployee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”)| 4,395| 4,360 | 4,425  \nTotal| $| 145,490| $| 121,936 | $| 134,217  \n  \nCapitalized stock-based compensation cost was not material in any year presented.\n\nAt February 3, 2024, the Company had one active stock-based compensation plan (further described in Note H: Stockholders’ Equity). The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the purchase date.\n\nTotal stock-based compensation recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:\n\nStatements of Earnings Classification ($000)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nCost of goods sold| $| 76,301| $| 67,141 | $| 66,500  \nSelling, general and administrative| 69,189| 54,795 | 67,717  \nTotal| $| 145,490| $| 121,936 | $| 134,217  \n  \nThe tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021were $29.6 million, $24.8 million, and $25.6 million, respectively.\n\n46\n\nNote D: Debt\n\nLong-term debt. Unsecured senior debt (the “Senior Notes”), net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consisted of the following:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \n3.375% Senior Notes due 2024| $| 249,713| $| 249,257  \n4.600% Senior Notes due 2025| 698,441| 697,161  \n0.875% Senior Notes due 2026| 497,268| 496,038  \n4.700% Senior Notes due 2027| 240,335| 239,899  \n4.800% Senior Notes due 2030| 132,776| 132,602  \n1.875% Senior Notes due 2031| 495,820| 495,254  \n5.450% Senior Notes due 2050| 146,377| 146,299  \nTotal long-term debt1| $| 2,460,730| $| 2,456,510  \nLess: current portion| $| 249,713| $| —  \nTotal due beyond one year| $| 2,211,017| $| 2,456,510  \n  \n1Net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $14.3 million and $18.5 million as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. \n\nInterest on all Senior Notes is payable semi-annually and the Senior Notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal.\n\nAs of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the aggregate fair value of the seven outstanding series of Senior Notes was approximately $2.3 billion. The fair value is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance. \n\nThe following table shows scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt:\n\n($000)  \n---  \n2024| $| 250,000  \n2025| $| 700,000  \n2026| $| 500,000  \n2027| $| 241,786  \nThereafter| $| 783,205  \n  \nRevolving credit facilities. The Company’s $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) expires in February 2027 and may be extended at the Company’s request for up to two additional one-year periods subject to customary conditions. The Credit Facility contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. It also contains an option allowing the Company to increase the size of its Credit Facility by up to an additional $700 million, with the agreement of the committing lenders. Interest on borrowings under this Credit Facility is a term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) (or an alternate benchmark rate, if Term SOFR is no longer available) plus an applicable margin and is payable quarterly and upon maturity.\n\n47\n\nThe Credit Facility is subject to a quarterly Consolidated Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR financial leverage ratio covenant. As of February 3, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenant, had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the $1.3 billion Credit Facility remained in place and available.\n\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nInterest expense on long-term debt| $| 84,596| $| 84,558 | $| 88,286  \nOther interest expense| 1,599| 1,668 | 1,351  \nCapitalized interest| (12,106)| (5,678)| (14,476)  \nInterest income| (238,207)| (77,706)| (833)  \nInterest (income) expense, net| $| (164,118)| $| 2,842 | $| 74,328  \n  \nNote E: Leases\n\nThe Company currently leases its store locations with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from three years to ten years. Store leases typically contain provisions for three to four renewal options of five years each. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the sole discretion of the Company. Most store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment of variable lease costs. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of sales (“percentage rent”) and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company does not have any financing leases.\n\nThe Company leases certain distribution/warehouse facilities with expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2031 and the majority contain renewal provisions. The Company also leases office space for its Los Angeles and Boston buying offices. The lease terms for these facilities expire in 2027 and 2026, respectively.

The state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2032.\n\nThe changes in amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (gross of federal tax benefits and excluding interest and penalties) at fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 are as follows:\n\n($000)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nUnrecognized tax benefits - beginning of year| $| 53,544| $| 60,547 | $| 60,240  \nGross increases:  \nTax positions in current period| 13,206| 10,132 | 10,381  \nTax positions in prior period| 2,295| 672 | 1,494  \nGross decreases:  \nTax positions in prior periods| (4,366)| (6,808)| (1,795)  \nLapse of statutes of limitations| (11,148)| (9,989)| (9,757)  \nSettlements| (1,152)| (1,010)| (16)  \nUnrecognized tax benefits - end of year| $| 52,379| $| 53,544 | $| 60,547  \n  \nAt the end of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits were $58.6 million, $60.6 million, and $68.1 million inclusive of $6.2 million, $7.1 million, and $7.6 million of related reserves for interest and penalties, respectively. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for taxes on earnings. If recognized, $46.6 million would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amounts that would impact the effective tax rate relates to amounts attributable to deferred tax assets and liabilities. These amounts are net of federal and state income taxes.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that certain federal and state tax matters may be concluded or statutes of limitations may lapse during the next twelve months. Accordingly, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $10.8 million.\n\nThe Company is open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2020 through 2023. The Company’s state income tax returns are generally open to audit under the various statutes of limitations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. Certain state tax returns are currently under audit by various tax authorities. The Company does not expect the results of these audits to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNote G: Employee Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan, employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to 4% of the employee’s salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $26.9 million, $24.8 million, and $23.6 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company also makes available to management a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan which allows management to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the 401(k) plan. Other long-term assets include $165.6 million and $155.5 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, of long-term plan investments, at market value, set aside or designated for the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Refer to Note B: Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Plan investments are designated by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. The Company has a corresponding liability to participants of $165.6 million and $155.5 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, included in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n51\n\nIn addition, the Company has certain individuals who receive or will receive post-employment medical benefits. The estimated liability for these benefits of $13.1 million and $13.3 million is included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\n\nNote H: Stockholders’ Equity\n\nCommon stock. In May 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock through fiscal 2022.\n\nIn March 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a two-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of the Company’s common stock through fiscal 2023. This program replaced the previous $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, effective at the end of fiscal 2021 (at which time the Company had repurchased $650 million under the previous $1.5 billion program).\n\nIn March 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new two-year program to repurchase up to $2.1 billion of the Company’s common stock through fiscal 2025.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\nFiscal Year| Shares repurchased(in millions)|  Average repurchaseprice| Amount repurchased(in millions)  \n---|---|---|---  \n2023| 8.2| $| 115.24| $| 950| 1  \n2022| 10.3 | $| 92.15 | $| 950  \n2021| 5.7 | $| 114.29 | $| 650  \n1 Amount excludes excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  \n  \nPreferred stock.The Company has 4.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized, with a par value of $.01 per share. No preferred stock is issued or outstanding.\n\nDividends.On March 5, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3675 per common share, payable on March 29, 2024. The Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.3350 per common share in February, May, August, and November 2023. The Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.3100 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2022. The Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.2850 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2021. During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company paid dividends of $454.8 million, $431.3 million, and $405.1 million, respectively.\n\n2017 Equity Incentive Plan. On May 17, 2017, the Company’s stockholders approved the Ross Stores, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) which replaced the Company’s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (“Predecessor Plan”). The 2017 Plan, which was authorized to issue a maximum of 12.0 million shares, was immediately effective upon approval and no further awards were granted under the Predecessor Plan, which was terminated.\n\nThe 2017 Plan has an initial share reserve of 12.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock which can be increased by a maximum of 5.5 million shares from certain expired, withheld, or forfeited shares from the 2017 Plan or the Predecessor Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may potentially include the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred compensation awards. As of February 3, 2024, there were 7.8 million shares available for grant under the 2017 Plan.\n\n52\n\nA summary of restricted stock and performance share award activity for fiscal 2023 is presented below:\n\nNumber ofshares (000)| Weighted-averagegrant datefair value  \n---|---  \nUnvested at January 28, 2023| 3,943 | $| 99.69  \nAwarded| 1,690 | 109.59  \nReleased| (1,139)| 95.98  \nForfeited| (99)| 102.40  \nUnvested at February 3, 2024| 4,395| $| 104.52  \n  \nAll unvested shares at February 3, 2024 are only subject to service vesting conditions. The market value of shares of restricted stock and performance shares at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period of generally threeto five years. The unamortized compensation expense at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 was $217.1 million and $183.2 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.7 years and 1.8 years, respectively. Intrinsic value for unvested restricted stock, defined as the closing market value per share on the last business day of fiscal year 2023 (or $143.68), applied to the unvested shares was $631.5 million. A total of 7.8 million, 8.9 million, and 9.3 million shares were available for new restricted stock awards at the end of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, shares purchased by the Company for tax withholding totaled 0.5 million shares in each year and are considered treasury shares which are available for reissuance. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the Company held 15.8 million and 15.3 million shares of treasury stock, respectively.\n\nThe Company has a performance share award program for senior executives. A performance share award represents a right to receive shares of restricted stock on a specified settlement date based on the Company’s attainment of a performance goal during the performance period, which is the Company’s fiscal year. If attained, the restricted stock then vests over a service period, generally three years from the date the performance award was granted.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees participating in the quarterly offering period can choose to have up to the lesser of 10% of their annual base earnings or the IRS annual share purchase limit of $25,000 in aggregate market value to purchase the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the closing market price on the date of purchase. Purchases occur on a quarterly basis (on the last trading day of each calendar quarter). The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the purchase date.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, employees purchased approximately 0.3 million shares in each year of the Company’s common stock under the plan at weighted-average per share prices of $98.86, $74.54, and $99.07, respectively. Through February 3, 2024, approximately 41.3 million shares had been issued under this plan and 3.6 million shares remained available for future issuance.\n\nNote I: Litigation, Claims, and Assessments\n\nLike many retailers, the Company has been named in class/representative action lawsuits, primarily in California, alleging violations by the Company of wage and hour laws. Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of February 3, 2024.\n\nThe Company is also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed against the Company may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that the Company violated federal, state, and/or local laws. Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the resolution of currently pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n53\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n54\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nApril 1, 2024 \n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1982.\n\n55\n\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone\n\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at that reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.\n\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) as set forth inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our evaluation under the framework inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 3, 2024.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024 has also been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is stated in their report, dated April 1, 2024, which is included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nQuarterly Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nNone\n\n56\n\nITEM 9C.

BUSINESS\nRoss Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion\nstores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS®.\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,693 locations in 40 states, the District of\nColumbia, and Guam, as of January 28, 2023. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel,\naccessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store\nregular prices every day. Ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households.\nWe also operate 322 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states as of January 28, 2023. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-\npriced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of\n20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS store is located\nin an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood, and its target customers typically\ncome from households with more moderate incomes than Ross customers.\nThe merchant, store field, and distribution operations for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS are separate. The two chains share certain\ncorporate and support services.\nBoth our Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS brands target value-conscious customers. The decisions we make, from merchandising,\npurchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer profiles. We believe that both brands derive\na competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories, in organized and\neasy-to-shop store environments.\nOur mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:\n• Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.\n• Meet customer needs on a local basis.\n• Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.\n• Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021 as fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and\nfiscal 2020, respectively, each of which were 52-week years.\nMerchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing\nWe seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel,\naccessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty\nstore regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s\nDISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is on trend and fashionable in each category. New\nmerchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review\ntheir merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the\nmarket. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a\ntreasure-hunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name\nbargains for the family and the home.\nMerchandising. Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-\nseason, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe merchandise with nationally\nrecognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally\nleave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell.\nWe have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we may offer\nfewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection within each classification,\nwith a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. Our merchandise offerings\n14\ninclude, but are not limited to, apparel, footwear, accessories, small furniture, home accents, bed and bath, beauty, toys,\nluggage, gourmet food, cookware, jewelry and watches, and pet accessories.\nPurchasing. We have a large network of merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and\nbelieve we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our\nmerchandise directly from manufacturers.\nWe believe our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a\nnumber of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day\nrelative to department and specialty stores for Ross, and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By\npurchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage\nof imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.\nUnlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that vendors or manufacturers provide promotional\nallowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For\nmost orders, delivery is made to one of our distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain\nsignificant discounts on purchases.\nThe merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer and\nbrand overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season (“close-out” purchases), and production direct from\nbrands and factories (“upfront” purchases). We also source merchandise under in-house brands or vendor brands. Upon receipt,\nmerchandise can be shipped to stores in-season or can be stored in our warehouses as packaway merchandise.\nPackaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be\nthe beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the\npercentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. The timing of the release\nof packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation\nto our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of\npurchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months.\nIn fiscal 2022, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available\nin the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately 40% of total inventories as of January 28, 2023 and January 29,\n2022.\nOur primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation’s two largest apparel markets. We also\noperate a smaller buying office located in Boston. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently,\nsourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to\nstrengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.\nAt the end of fiscal 2022, we had over 900 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd’s\nDISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, and each includes merchandise management, buyers, and\nassistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average seven years of experience, including merchandising\npositions with other retailers. We expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to\nfurther develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to\nprocure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.\nThe off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net\nprices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net\nprices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.\nPricing. We sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular\nprices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20% to 70% below most moderate\ndepartment and discount store regular prices. Our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as\nwell as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate\ndepartment and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.\n15\nOur pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices\nand mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and\ncompelling value. Our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale on a\nweekly basis, as well as at the end of fashion seasons, to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate\nthe flow of fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in\nmoderate department and discount stores.\nStores\nAs of January 28, 2023, we operated a total of 2,015 stores comprised of 1,693 Ross stores and 322 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nOur stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and\nsuburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, our real estate strategy is to cluster Ross\nstores with the objective to increase our market penetration and to benefit from economies of scale in advertising, distribution,\nfield management, and other overhead. When evaluating a new store location, we consider factors such as the availability and\nquality of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we\ncontinue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions. Where possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal\nalterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time and at reasonable costs in a given\nmarket. We do the same for dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nWe believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS is our organized and easy-to-shop in-store\nenvironment which allows customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure-hunt shopping\nexperience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing rooms,\ncheckout, and merchandise return areas. Our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle\nlayout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. We enable our\ncustomers to select among sizes and styles through prominent category and sizing markers. Our stores have shopping carts\nand/or baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store exits for\ncustomer ease and efficient staffing.\nWe accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered)\nreturned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with\nstore credit.\nOperating Costs\nConsistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the\nfactors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores\ndue to a store design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies; economies of\nscale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and purchasing\ndecisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats.\nInformation Systems\nWe continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years.\nCurrent initiatives include continued enhancements to our stores, supply chain, merchandising, and cybersecurity systems.\nThese initiatives support future growth, the execution and achievement of our plans, ongoing stability, and compliance.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores. These distribution\ncenters are large, highly automated, and built to suit our specific off-price business model. We also operate warehouse facilities\nfor packaway storage.\nWe utilize a combination of owned, leased, and third-party cross-dock facilities to distribute merchandise from distribution\ncenters to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week\ndepending on location.\n16\nWe believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate\nprocessing and storage capacity to support our near term store growth plans. Information on the size and locations of our\ndistribution centers and warehouse facilities is found in ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nMarketing and Advertising\nWe use a variety of marketing and advertising media to communicate our value proposition to customers—savings off the same\nbrands carried at department or specialty stores every day. This includes a mix of television, digital channels, radio, and new\nstore grand openings. Within digital channels, we continue to grow our social media, digital video, and digital audio presence to\ncommunicate our brand positions. We believe that a mix of channels is important to reach our customers.\nTrademarks\nThe trademarks for ROSS®, Ross Dress For Less®, and dd’s DISCOUNTS® have been registered with the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office.\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 28, 2023, we had approximately 101,000 total associates, which includes both full- and part-time associates in our\nstores, distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices. The majority of these associates worked in our retail stores.\nAdditionally, we hire temporary associates, especially during peak seasons. We have no associates that are covered by a\ncollective bargaining agreement. Management considers the relationship between the Company and our associates to be strong.\nOur associates play essential roles in not only delivering great values to our customers but also evolving and strengthening the\nculture at Ross. We strive to have a workforce that reflects our values, supports our business growth, and strengthens our\ncommunities. Throughout our organization, we recognize and appreciate the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing\nour associates and we have a number of key programs to do so.\nOur culture. Values start with our people. At Ross, we strive to do what is right for our associates, customers, and the\ncommunities we serve. We are also committed to promoting an inclusive culture and work environment in which our associates\nare treated with dignity and respect.\nTalent development. The professional growth of our associates is important to our success as a business. We identify and\nenumerate key competencies we believe are critical to our ability to execute our business model and deliver the values our\ncustomers expect. We utilize these competencies in the hiring, development, evaluation, and future planning of our teams. We\nprovide training opportunities to help associates grow and build their careers. Our associates, managers, and executives may\nparticipate in technical and leadership development activities. We support associates interested in leadership roles by offering\nopportunities to gain experience and build the skills necessary to advance within the Company.\nCompensation and benefits. We are dedicated to providing our associates with competitive pay and benefits, a safe working\nenvironment, recognition for achievements, channels to share opinions and ideas, opportunities to give back, support for\neducational advancement, and merchandise and other discounts. We are also continuing to invest in our associates with\nprograms that assist with physical, emotional, and financial wellness.\nDiversity, equality, and inclusion. We care about our associates and the communities we serve. We are committed to building\ndiverse teams and an inclusive culture that respects, values, and celebrates the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of\nthose who work and shop with us. We are focused on executing strategies to support our commitment to diversity, equality, and\ninclusion.\nCommunity and social impact. We provide our associates the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social\nimpact through various programs such as our matching gift program, volunteer time off for eligible associates, and a scholarship\nprogram for our associates and their dependents.\n17\nCompetition\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant\ndiscounts on brand name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and\nconsistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we continue to make\nstrategic investments in our organization. We also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen\nour ability to plan, buy, and allocate product to our stores. We operate in an attractive sector of retail which offers both value and\nconvenience. We believe that we are well-positioned within the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry to compete\nbased on these factors.\nNevertheless, the retail apparel and home fashion markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging and\nrapidly changing macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for our business from online retailers,\ndepartment stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet\nstores, many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources. The retail apparel\nand home-related businesses may become even more competitive in the future.\nSeasonality\nAlthough our off-price business is subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, sales are generally higher during the\nsecond half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons.\nAvailable Information\nThe internet address for our corporate website is www.rossstores.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on\nForm 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and any amendments to those reports are made available free of\ncharge on or through the Investors section of our corporate website, promptly after being electronically filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission. Our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report is found in the Social Responsibility section of\nour corporate website. That report and the other information found on our corporate website are not part of this report or of any\nother report or regulatory filing we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n18\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nThe following sets forth the names and ages of our executive officers, indicating each person’s principal occupation or\nemployment during at least the past five years.

RISK FACTORS\nOur fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases,\nand other investor communications, including those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements with\nrespect to anticipated future events, our projected future financial performance, operations, competitive position, and our planned\ngrowth, that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-\nlooking statements and from our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis for a more\ncomplete identification and discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected\nby a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the\nfollowing:\nMACROECONOMIC AND RETAIL INDUSTRY BUSINESS RISKS\nWe are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical\nconditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income, and also increase our costs. Inflation,\nsupply chain disruptions, and other accompanying economic impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the COVID-19\npandemic, or other external events may continue to have significant negative effects on our costs and on consumer\nconfidence, shopping behavior, and spending, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nConsumer spending levels and shopping behaviors for the merchandise we sell are affected by many external factors. Currently,\nelevated inflation is affecting consumer demand for our products and increasing our costs. Factors such as higher fuel and\nenergy costs, rising food prices, rising interest rates, increases in housing costs, the size and timing of government stimulus\nprograms, wage rates, unemployment levels, income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds, availability of consumer credit,\nconsumer debt levels, and the resulting effects on consumers’ disposable income and consumer confidence in future economic\nconditions all have an impact on consumer spending habits for our merchandise.\nThe ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is resulting in major, potentially prolonged economic sanctions and other responses from\nthe United States and other countries, which present significant risks and uncertainties. These events may continue to cause\nvarious adverse macroeconomic effects, including inflation, increases in fuel and energy costs, rising food prices, and depressed\nfinancial markets.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to present significant risks and uncertainty. The widespread pandemic continues\nto adversely impact global economies and has resulted in significant economic volatility. The extent and duration of the impacts\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the\nduration and spread of outbreaks within the U.S., regional surges in infection, vaccination rates, and acquired immunity rates, the\neffectiveness of vaccines in controlling current and future variants of the virus, the response by all levels of government in their\nefforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the resulting economic disruptions, and the related impact on consumer\nconfidence, shopping behavior, and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. There is significant\nuncertainty over potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping patterns as the pandemic continues and as different\nregions experience surges. Such impacts have and may in the future adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, financial\nresults, and our capital resources.\nElevated inflation, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, bank failures, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and other potential, adverse\ndevelopments in these or other areas, could reduce demand for our merchandise, increase our cost of goods, freight, and\npayroll, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins. All of our stores\nare located in the United States and its territories, so we are especially susceptible to changes in the U.S. economy.\n20\nCompetitive pressures in the apparel and home-related merchandise retailing industry are high.\nThe retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented, as many different retailers compete for market\nshare by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase in the\nfuture. There are limited economic barriers for others to enter the off-price retail sector. We compete for customers, associates,\nstore locations, and merchandise with many other local, regional, and national retailers, traditional department stores, upscale\nmass merchandisers, other off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail\ncommerce. Our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing, business strategies, and promotional activity (particularly during\nholiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. The substantial sales growth in e-\ncommerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models, and an\nincrease in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives. Intense\npressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, or a failure to\neffectively execute our off-price model, could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause us to\ntake greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins.\nUnexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and home-related merchandise\ncould adversely affect us.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand. We work on an\nongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences, and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer\nneeds. It is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the\nmultiple markets in which we operate throughout the United States and its territories. Although our off-price business model\nprovides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise\nmix to ever-changing consumer tastes, our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer\ntrends and preferences, particularly in our newer geographic markets. Failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends,\npreferences, and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and\nother merchandise, and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our\nstores.\nUnseasonable weather and prolonged, extreme temperatures, as well as events such as storms, affect consumers’ buying\npatterns and willingness to shop, and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and\nseasonal merchandise. Among other things, weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or\nrequire us to close certain stores temporarily, thereby reducing store traffic. Even if stores are not closed, many customers may\nbe unable to go, or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather. As a result, adverse or unseasonable weather in any of\nour markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns, which may negatively affect our sales\nand margins.\nA pandemic, natural or man-made disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores,\noffices, or a distribution center could harm our business.\nAlthough no one store accounts for more than one percent of our sales, our corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office,\nnine distribution centers/warehouses, and approximately 22% of our stores are located in California. Natural or other disasters,\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic (or other future pandemics), wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or other\nextreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions, and acts of war or terrorism, or public health issues, in any of our\nmarkets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain, or could shut down, damage, or destroy our stores or distribution\nfacilities. We carry fire, flood, wind, and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such\nevents.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nWe depend on the market availability, quantity, and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable\ndiscounts, and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment\nof merchandise at competitive prices.\nOpportunistic buying, lean inventory levels, and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our off-price business strategy.\nMaintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and\nsustain our sales and gross margins. Our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants, who are in the\nmarketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season. Our ability to meet\nor exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous, sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that\nwe can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers. To\nthe extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess\ninventory, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. To the extent that certain of our\nvendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be\n21\nmaterially reduced. Because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other\ncountries, constraints on the availability of shipping capacity, changes in transportation costs or in U.S. tariffs, trade relationships,\nor tax policies, and natural disasters, or public health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic (or other future pandemics), that\nreduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods, could also result in disruptions to our existing supply\nrelationships. Shortages, delays, or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality, value-priced merchandise would likely\nhave a material adverse effect on our sales and margins.\nOur inability to continually attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our off-price\nretail strategies along with labor shortages, increased turnover, or increased labor costs could adversely affect our\noperating results.\nLike other retailers, we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization, management,\nstores, distribution centers, and other key areas. Many of our retail store associates are in entry level or part-time positions with\nhistorically high rates of turnover. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing\nwage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or\nhealthcare benefits.\nAny increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or, if we fail to pay competitive wages, may result in increased\nturnover. Excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding, hiring, and training new associates. If we cannot\nhire enough qualified associates, or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from third-party providers,\nespecially during our peak seasons, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nBecause of the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must also attract, train, and retain our key associates across the\nCompany, especially within our buying organization. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively\nidentify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is no assurance that we\nwill be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse\neffect on our growth, operations, or financial position.\nWe need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth.\nSuccessful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas. We compete with other retailers\nand businesses for acceptable store locations. For the purpose of identifying locations, we rely on consumer demographics.\nWhile we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations, we recognize that this information\ncannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy. Time frames for negotiations and store\ndevelopment vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations. We may not be\nable to open new stores or, if opened, operate those new stores profitably. Construction and other delays in store openings could\nhave a negative impact on our business and operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease\nterms which could negatively impact our operating results. New stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our\nexisting stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores. If we\ncannot acquire sites on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in\nvarious markets.\nTo achieve growth, we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets.\nOur growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and in new geographic regions.\nThere are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets.\nStores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have\nhigher construction, occupancy, advertising, or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our\noverall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes, and discretionary spending patterns that\nare more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in\nnew markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in marketing, advertising, and\npromotional activity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate, and retain qualified\nassociates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries.\nRisks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas, compliance with anti-dumping regulations,\neconomic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including shipping capacity limitations, cost increases, inflation,\nrecession, and exchange rate fluctuations), foreign government regulations, employment and labor matters, concerns relating to\nhuman rights, working conditions, and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced, transparency of\nsourcing and supply chains, exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues, consumer perceptions of the safety\nof imported merchandise, wars and fears of war, political unrest, natural disasters, regulations to address climate change, and\ntrade restrictions.\n22\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell (even when we purchase it domestically, often as excess inventory\nsold to us by a domestic vendor) is originally manufactured in other countries. In addition, we directly source a portion of the\nproducts sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in Asia (including China). We also buy products that originate\nfrom foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives. Although our foreign purchases of\nmerchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies\ncould increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors. When we are the importer of record, we may be subject\nto regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer.\nTo the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products, any event\ncausing a disruption, delay, or increase in the cost of imports, including the imposition of import or other restrictions such as\nproduct detention, war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic (or other\nfuture pandemics) could adversely affect our business. The flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely\naffected by global shipping capacity limitations, or by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we\npurchase are manufactured. Trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, applicable to the products we sell could\nalso affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. We\ncannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced, or in which our products are currently\nmanufactured or may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign\ngovernments or the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions.\nOur ability to effectively advertise and market our business could impact customer traffic and demand for our\nmerchandise.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities, the name recognition\nand reputation of our brands, and the location of our stores. Although we use marketing and advertising mediums to attract\ncustomers to our stores, particularly through television and digital channels, our competitors may spend more or use different\napproaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our advertising and other promotional programs may not\nbe effective or may be perceived negatively, or could require increased expenditures, any of which could adversely affect sales\nor increase costs.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nIn order to achieve our planned gross margins, we must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory\nshortage. As a result of changes in shopping behaviors due to inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and disruptions to\nsupply chains and store operations, we are at risk for inventory imbalances and the potential for higher than normal\nlevels of markdowns to sell through our inventory, increased cost of goods, and for lost sales due to insufficient\ninventory to meet customer demand, any of which would negatively affect our sales, gross margin, and operating\nresults.\nWe purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans. If our actual demand is lower than our sales plans, we may\nexperience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, resulting in decreased\nprofit margins. Inflation may continue to cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned, and we may not be\nable to sell the inventory to our customers at correspondingly increased prices, resulting in decreased profit margins. We also\nmay have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic and\naccompanying economic impacts may continue to change shopping behavior so that our predictions and sales plans become\nless accurate, and that may lead us to have higher than usual levels of slow-moving or non-salable inventory at our prior planned\nprice levels. We would then need to aggressively and progressively reduce our selling prices in order to clear out that inventory,\nwhich would result in decreased profit margins or losses on sales of that inventory, and adversely affect our results of operations\nin future periods.\nAs a regular part of our business, we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until\na later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality\nof the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans, but it typically remains in storage less than six\nmonths. Packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory. If we make packaway purchases that do\nnot align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores, we could have significant inventory markdowns.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow. Although we have various systems to help protect\nagainst loss or theft of our inventory, both when in storage and once distributed to our stores, we may have damaged, lost, or\nstolen inventory (called “shortage”) in higher amounts than we forecast, which would result in write-offs, lost sales, and reduced\nmargins.\n23\nInformation or data security breaches, including cyber-attacks on our transaction processing and computer information\nsystems, could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer, credit card, employee, or other private and\nvaluable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business, disrupt our operations, damage our\nreputation, and increase our costs.\nLike other large retailers, we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process, transmit, and\nstore payment card and other personal and confidential information, and to provide information or data security for those\ntransactions. Some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check\napprovals, and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards, are controlled by the banking and payment card\nindustry, not by us. Cybercriminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate\ncustomer or business information, including but not limited to credit/debit card, personnel, or trade information. Cybercriminals\n(including state-sponsored actors) may attempt to penetrate our information systems to deprive us from access to necessary\nbusiness information and to disrupt our operations, as part of so-called “ransomware” extortion activity or otherwise. Despite\nsecurity measures we have in place, and our efforts to prevent, monitor, and mitigate attacks and errors, our facilities and\nsystems (or those of third-party service providers we utilize or connect to) may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of\nvandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, phishing, ransomware attacks, and\nsimilar fraudulent attacks, or other similar events. It is also possible that an associate within our Company, or a third party we do\nbusiness with, may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information. The increasing\nsophistication of cybercriminals, the increased potential for cyberattacks, and the advances in computer capabilities and remote\naccess increases these risks. A breach of our information or data security, a system shut down or other response we may take,\nor our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information, could result in damage to our\nreputation, loss of customer confidence, violation (or alleged violation) of applicable laws (including laws relating to consumer\ndata protection and privacy, and required notifications of data security breaches), and expose us to civil claims, litigation, and\nregulatory action, and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations.\nDisruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver\nproduct to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nVarious information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business. We depend on the\nintegrity, continuous availability, and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores, track inventory\nflow, manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics, generate performance and financial reports, and support\nmerchandising decisions.\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace information\nprocesses and systems that are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose sound investments and implement\nthem at the right pace. The risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken. An\nexcessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to\nrealize benefits from new technology. Poorly targeting opportunities, failing to make good investments, or making an investment\ncommitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business\nand results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system\nchanges could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide us with the\nanticipated benefits, or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.\nOur information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer\nand telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events\nsuch as severe storms, fires, earthquakes, floods, acts of terrorism, and design or usage errors by our associates or by third\nparties. If our information systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make\nsignificant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material\ninterruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport\nmerchandise to our stores or our distribution centers, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and\nresult in lost sales or increased supply chain costs. Such disruptions may result from public health issues such as the COVID-19\npandemic (or other future pandemics), cyberattacks, damage or destruction to our distribution centers, weather-related events,\nnatural disasters, trade restrictions, tariffs, third-party strikes or ineffective cross-dock operations, work stoppages or slowdowns,\nshipping capacity constraints, supply or shipping interruptions, or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruptions could\nnegatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\n24\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, operations, and financial performance and\ncondition.\nThe United States and other countries continue to experience a global pandemic with related, potentially significant, disruptions\nand cost impacts to retail operations and supply chains, and to general economic activities. The COVID-19 pandemic continues\nto evolve, with new virus variants, and has an unknown duration and severity.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our business and operations may be affected by future recommendations and/or\nmandates from federal, state, and local authorities. Additional outbreaks and spreading of the disease have been occurring\nacross the United States and levels of spread have gone up and down in different regions. Government authorities in affected\nregions have in the past taken actions, sometimes drastic, including mandatory capacity restrictions, reduced operating hours,\nand closure of retail operations, in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic may potentially\nadversely affect our ability to adequately staff our distribution centers, stores, and merchant and other support operations. We\nmay still face temporary store and distribution center closures nationally, regionally, or in specific locations.\nWe have a concentration of store locations in the states of California, Texas, and Florida; together those states include almost\n50% of our stores. More than half of our distribution center and warehouse capacity is located in California. A severe outbreak or\ntemporary closure affecting these facilities would be very disruptive to our ability to supply merchandise to our stores. Further,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact multiple countries, leading to supply related disruptions, including port of exit/entry\ncongestion, shipping delays, and ocean freight cost increases, which may also adversely affect our ability to access and ship\nproducts from affected regions.\nDamage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nOur reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity. Any incident that erodes the\ntrust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business, particularly if the\nincident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Such an incident could also include alleged acts or\nomissions by, or situations involving, our vendors (or their contractors or subcontractors), the landlords for our stores, or our\nassociates outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. Similarly,\nour responses to events or crises and our position (or perceived lack of position) on environmental, social, and governance\n(“ESG”) matters, such as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, diversity, equality, and inclusion (“DE&I”), responsible\nsourcing, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation.\nThe use of social media and other online platforms, including blogs, applications, websites, and other forms of internet-based\ncommunications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, continues to\nincrease. The availability of information (whether correct or erroneous) on social media and other online platforms is virtually\nimmediate, as is its impact. Many social media and other online platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and\nparticipants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content. The opportunity for dissemination of information,\nincluding inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our Company may be\nposted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could\nnegatively affect our sales, diminish customer trust, reduce employee morale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting\nand retaining qualified associates. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nWe are subject to impacts from instances of damage to our stores and losses of merchandise accompanying protests\nor demonstrations, which may result in temporary store closures.\nIn recent years, there have been demonstrations and protests in cities throughout the United States. While they have generally\nbeen peaceful, in some locations they have been accompanied by violence, damage to retail stores, and the loss of\nmerchandise. While generally subject to coverage by insurance, the repairs of damage to our stores and replacement of lost\nmerchandise may increase our costs and temporarily disrupt store operations, and we may incur increased operating costs for\nadditional security. Governmental authorities in affected cities and regions may take action in an effort to protect people and\nproperty while permitting lawful and non-violent protests, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, which may\nbe disruptive to our operations. These activities, governmental responses, and resulting media coverage may also harm\nconsumer confidence and perceptions of personal well-being and security, which may negatively affect shopping behavior and\nour sales.\n25\nCOMPLIANCE, REGULATORY, AND LEGAL RISKS\nConsumer problems or legal issues involving the quality, safety, or authenticity of products we sell could harm our\nreputation, result in lost sales, and/or increase our costs.\nVarious governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell. These regulations and related laws\nfrequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. Because of our opportunistic buying\nstrategies, we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors we have not previously dealt with.\nAlthough our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally\nrely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable\nproduct safety and other laws, any non-compliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls, make\ncertain products unsalable, or require us to incur significant compliance costs.\nWe require our vendors (for both import and domestic purchasing) to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct,\ncompliance, and other requirements, including those relating to environmental, employment and labor (including wages and\nworking conditions), health, safety, and anti-bribery standards. From time to time, our vendors, their contractors, or their\nsubcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws. Although we have\nimplemented policies and procedures to promote compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign\nmarkets and importing merchandise, and to monitor the compliance of our suppliers, this does not guarantee that suppliers and\nother third parties with whom we do business will not violate (or not allegedly violate) such laws and regulations or our policies.\nSignificant or continuing noncompliance (or alleged noncompliance) with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could\nhave a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to claims and liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results\nof operations.\nRegardless of fault, any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer (particularly products such\nas food and children’s items), issues with the authenticity of merchandise, or our inability or that of our vendors, to comply on a\ntimely basis with laws and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, result in lost sales, inventory write-offs,\nuninsured product liability or other legal claims, penalties or losses, merchandise recalls, and increased costs.\nAn adverse outcome in various legal, regulatory, or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our\ncosts.\nAs an ordinary part of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, tax audits, and/or other\nlegal matters. These may include lawsuits, inquiries, demands, or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and\nprivate plaintiffs, including those relating to employment and employee benefits (including classification, employment rights,\ndiscrimination, harassment, wage and hour, and retaliation), workplace safety, securities, real estate, tort, commercial, consumer\nprotection, privacy, product compliance and safety, advertising, environmental, comparative pricing, product labeling, intellectual\nproperty, tax, escheat, and whistle-blower claims. We continue to be involved in a number of employment-related lawsuits,\nincluding class/representative actions which are primarily in California.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local rules and regulations in the United States, and to various international laws, which\nchange from time to time. These legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, including the cost of\nhealth care, workforce management and employee benefits, minimum wages, advertising, comparative pricing, import/export,\nsourcing and manufacturing, data protection (including customer and associate data privacy, choice, and notification rights),\nintellectual property, and others. If we fail to comply (or are alleged not to comply) with any of these requirements, we may be\nsubject to fines, settlements, penalties, or other costs. In addition, an adverse outcome (or the adverse publicity from the claims)\nin any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax\nreturns and reports by federal, state, and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims. Actual results may\ndiffer and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes. In addition, applicable\naccounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and those changes could have material effects on our\nreported operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding apparel and home-related merchandise produced in other countries could\nadversely affect our business.\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries. The U.S. government\nhas at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies, including those with China. This exposes us to\nrisks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased\nuncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships,\nor tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost\nof goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we\n26\nmay fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes.\nIn addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business\ndecisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business\nopportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to\nthose changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our\nprofitability.\nGENERAL RISKS\nWe may experience volatility in sales and earnings.\nOur business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and back-to-school seasons, weather, and other factors. Although\nour off-price business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, we may still experience unexpected\ndecreases in sales from time to time, which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins. Significant operating\nexpenses, such as rent expense and associate wages, do not adjust proportionately with our sales. If sales in a certain period\nare lower than our plans, we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently, which could adversely affect our\noperating results.\nTo support our continuing operations, our new store and distribution center growth plans and other capital investment\nplans, our quarterly dividends, and our stock repurchase program, we must maintain sufficient liquidity; the COVID-19\npandemic and related economic disruptions are adding significant uncertainty and challenges.\nWe depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities, and to finance our\noperations, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels, and return value to our stockholders through\ndividends and stock repurchases. While the pandemic continues, disruptions to our operations may occur, nationally, regionally,\nor in specific locations. The situation continues to evolve and has an unknown duration and severity. If we are unable to generate\nsufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities, our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely\naffected.\nIf our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely\nimpacted. In addition, if we do not properly allocate our capital resources to maximize returns, our operations, cash flows, and\nreturns to stockholders could be adversely affected.\nITEM 1B.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe have been named in class/representative action lawsuits, primarily in California, alleging violations by us of wage and hour\nlaws and consumer protection laws. Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of January 28, 2023.\nWe are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed\nagainst us may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and\nemployment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal,\nstate, and/or local laws. Actions against us are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal\nissues and are subject to uncertainties.\nLike many retailers and other businesses, we have filed a lawsuit as plaintiff against various insurance companies with respect to\nour claims for insurance coverage for business interruption, property damage, and other losses that we have experienced as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our suit was filed in Alameda County, California in December 2020. The proceedings are\nongoing and remain subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe believe that the resolution of our currently pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and\nregulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOverview\nRoss Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and\ndd’s DISCOUNTS®. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,693 locations in 40\nstates, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of January 28, 2023. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer\napparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty\nstore regular prices every day. We also operate 322 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states as of January 28, 2023 that feature a\nmore moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for\nthe entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.\nOur primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and\nfinancial returns over the long term. Over the past three years, we have faced a series of unprecedented challenges from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, subsequent supply chain disruptions and their related cost pressures, and ongoing inflationary headwinds.\nThese conditions have had significant impacts not only on our own business operations and costs but also on our customers’\nhousehold budgets and in turn their shopping behaviors. As a result, our customers are seeking even stronger values when\nvisiting our stores. We are closely monitoring market share trends for the off-price industry and we believe our share gains will\ncontinue to grow through continued focus on bringing value and convenience to our consumers.\nWe believe our merchandising and operational strategies enable us to deliver the most competitive bargains available to meet\nour customers’ ongoing demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day. We believe\nour continued focus on these strategies will enable us to maximize our potential for both sales and profit growth in fiscal 2023\nand beyond.\nThe fiscal years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021 are referred to as fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021,\nand fiscal 2020, respectively, and were 52-week years.\nIn our fiscal 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we compared our results of operations and financial condition to fiscal 2020 and\nalso to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”). We believe the extended closure of our operations in the spring of\n2020, and the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic throughout fiscal 2020, made fiscal 2019 a more useful\nand relevant basis for comparison to our fiscal 2021 performance. For comparisons of fiscal 2021 to both fiscal 2019 and fiscal\n2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2021.\n32\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nSales\nSales (millions) $ 18,696 $ 18,916 $ 12,532\nSales (decline) growth (1.2)% 50.9% (21.9)%\nComparable store sales (decline) growth (4)% 1 13% 2 n/a 3\nCosts and expenses (as a percent of sales)\nCost of goods sold 74.6% 72.5% 78.5%\nSelling, general and administrative 14.8% 15.2% 20.0%\nInterest expense, net 0.0% 0.4% 0.7%\nEarnings before taxes (as a percent of sales) 10.6% 11.9% 0.8%\nNet earnings (as a percent of sales) 8.1% 9.1% 0.7%\n1 Comparable stores are stores open for more than 14 complete months.\n2 Amount shown is for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019. Comparable store sales for this purpose represents sales from stores that were\nopen at the end of fiscal 2019, less stores closed in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021.\n3 Given the temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable store sales metric for fiscal 2020 is not\nmeaningful.\nStores. Total stores open at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 2,015, 1,923, and 1,859, respectively. The number of\nstores at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 increased by 5%, 3%, and 3% from the respective prior years. In fiscal 2022, we\nopened 99 new stores. Looking forward to 2023, we expect to open approximately 100 new stores. We remain confident in our\nability to expand in both new and existing regional markets over time. We continue to believe that consumers’ increased focus on\nvalue and convenience and the significant number of brick-and-mortar retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several\nyears, provides opportunities for us to gain market share. Our longer term strategy is to open additional stores based on market\npenetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead\nexpenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We\nalso evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.\nStore Count 2022 2021 2020\nRoss\nBeginning of the period 1,628 1,585 1,546\nOpened in the period 71 44 50\nClosed in the period (6) 1 (1) (11)\nTotal Ross stores end of period 1,693 1,628 1,585\ndd’s DISCOUNTS\nBeginning of the period 295 274 259\nOpened in the period 28 21 16 2\nClosed in the period (1) — (1)\nTotal dd’s DISCOUNTS stores end of period 322 295 274\nTotal stores end of period 2,015 1,923 1,859\n1 Includes the temporary closure of a store impacted by a weather event.\n2 Includes the reopening of a store previously temporarily closed due to a weather event.\nThe total selling square footage as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021 was 41.4 million, 39.9 million,\nand 38.8 million, respectively.\n33\nSales. Sales for fiscal 2022 decreased $0.2 billion, or 1.2%, compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to a 4% decline\nin comparable store sales driven by escalating inflationary pressures that reduced customer demand during the fiscal year\ncombined with the benefit in the prior year from government stimulus, as well as pent-up customer demand as COVID-19\nrestrictions eased. The sales decline was partially offset by the opening of 92 net new stores during fiscal 2022.\nSales for fiscal 2021 increased $6.4 billion, or 50.9%, compared to fiscal 2020. This was primarily due to all store locations\nremaining open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores\nduring a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period. Sales for fiscal 2021 also benefited from a combination of\ngovernment stimulus payments, increasing vaccination rates, diminishing COVID-19 restrictions on operations, pent-up\nconsumer demand, and strong execution of our merchandising strategies. Sales also increased due to the opening of 64 net new\nstores during fiscal 2021.\nOur sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 1 2021 2020\nHome Accents and Bed and Bath 26% 26% 28%\nLadies 24% 25% 23%\nMen’s 15% 14% 14%\nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Cosmetics 14% 14% 14%\nShoes 12% 12% 12%\nChildren’s 9% 9% 9%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nThere remains significant uncertainty in the current macroeconomic environment, driven by inflation, increasing interest rates,\nthe continuing impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, concerns of a possible recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic. We\nexpect these factors to continue impacting both our customers and our business in fiscal 2023. We intend to address the\nuncertain and competitive conditions within the retail climate for apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing\nstrategies, continuing to strengthen our merchant organization, diversifying our merchandise mix, and further developing our\nsystems to improve our merchandise offerings. We cannot be sure our strategies and store expansion program will result in\nsales growth or an increase in net earnings.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2022 increased $0.2 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to higher\nocean and domestic freight costs, increased distribution costs, and higher merchandise markdowns, partially offset by lower\ncomparable store sales and lower buying costs. Cost of goods also increased due to the opening of 92 net new stores during\nfiscal 2022.\nCost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 increased $3.9 billion compared to fiscal 2020 mainly due to higher sales, given that all our\nstores were open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our\nstores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period. Cost of goods also increased due to the opening of 64\nnet new stores during fiscal 2021.\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2022 increased approximately 210 basis points from fiscal 2021 primarily\ndue to a 130 basis point decline in merchandise margin primarily due to higher ocean freight costs and increased markdowns, an\n85 basis point increase in distribution expenses primarily due to the timing of packaway inventory carrying costs and the\ndeleveraging effect from the opening of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center, a 30 basis point deleverage in occupancy\ncosts, and a 25 basis point increase in domestic freight costs primarily due to higher fuel costs. These increases were partially\noffset by a 60 basis point decrease in buying costs primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.\nWe expect incentive compensation expenses to return to target levels in fiscal 2023 and for domestic and ocean freight costs to\ndecrease.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)\ndecreased $115.2 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses\nand lower COVID-19 costs, partially offset by the opening of 92 net new stores during fiscal 2022.\nFor fiscal 2021, SG&A increased $371.2 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to all our stores\nremaining open throughout fiscal 2021 compared to the impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a\n34\nsignificant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period, and to the opening of 64 net new stores during fiscal 2021, partially\noffset by approximately $240 million in long-term debt refinancing costs incurred in fiscal 2020.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2022 decreased by approximately 45 basis points compared to fiscal 2021 primarily\ndue to lower incentive compensation expenses and lower COVID-19 costs, partially offset by higher wages and the deleveraging\neffect of the 4% comparable store sales decline.\nWe expect SG&A in fiscal 2023 to increase as a result of incentive compensation expenses returning to target levels.\nInterest expense, net. In fiscal 2022, net interest expense decreased by $71.5 million compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to\nincreased interest income from higher interest rates and lower interest expense on long-term debt due to the repayment of the\nprincipal on the $65.0 million notes in fiscal 2021, partially offset by lower capitalized interest.\nIn fiscal 2021, net interest expense decreased by $9.1 million compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the elimination of interest\nexpense on short-term debt due to the repayment of our $800 million revolving credit facility in October 2020 and higher\ncapitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center, partially offset by lower\ninterest income primarily due to lower interest rates.\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nInterest expense on long-term debt $ 84,558 $ 88,286 $ 88,544\nInterest expense on short-term debt — — 7,863\nOther interest expense 1,668 1,351 3,908\nCapitalized interest (5,678) (14,476) (12,251)\nInterest income (77,706) (833) (4,651)\nInterest expense, net $ 2,842 $ 74,328 $ 83,413\nTaxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was approximately 24%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020\nwas 20%. The increase in effective tax rate of 4% for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the impact of\nhiring tax credits on lower pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2020.\nOur effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state\ntaxes deductible on federal returns. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance, location of\nnew stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, and the resolution of tax positions with\nvarious tax authorities.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA made several changes to business tax provisions\nincluding a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The one percent excise tax does not\nimpact our effective tax rate.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act made\nseveral significant changes to business tax provisions including modifications for net operating losses, employee retention\ncredits, and deferral of employer payroll tax payments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law\nduring fiscal 2020. The CAA made several changes to business tax provisions including extending certain employment-related\ntax credits through December 31, 2025.\nNet earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2022 were lower than in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher cost of\ngoods sold, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and lower interest expense. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal\n2021 were higher compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold, lower SG&A expenses, and lower interest\nexpense, partially offset by higher taxes on earnings.\nEarnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022 was $4.38 compared to $4.87 in the prior year. The lower diluted\nearnings per share in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to a 12% decrease in net earnings, partially offset by the 2%\nreduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to stock repurchases under our stock repurchase\nprogram.\n35\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was $4.87 compared to $0.24 in fiscal 2020. The higher diluted earnings per share in\nfiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to all our store locations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative\nimpact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020\nperiod.\nFinancial Condition\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our primary\nongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease costs, taxes, capital\nexpenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and\nbuying and corporate offices. We also use cash to repurchase stock under active stock repurchase programs, pay dividends, and\nrepay debt as it becomes due.\n($ millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCash provided by operating activities $ 1,689.4 $ 1,738.8 $ 2,245.9\nCash used in investing activities (654.1) (557.8) (405.4)\nCash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,405.4) (1,152.4) 1,701.9\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents,\nand restricted cash and cash equivalents $ (370.1) $ 28.6 $ 3,542.4\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2022. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-\ncash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and an increase in deferred income taxes,\npartially offset by merchandise inventory payments and payment of fiscal 2021 incentive bonuses. Net cash provided by\noperating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2021. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for\ndepreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher merchandise inventory receipts net of\naccounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2020. This was primarily driven by higher\naccounts payable due to longer payment terms, lower merchandise receipts as we closely managed inventory levels and used\npackaway inventory to replenish our stores, and net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and\nstock-based compensation.\nThe decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by payment of\nfiscal 2021 incentive bonuses and lower net earnings, partially offset by lower merchandise inventory receipts net of accounts\npayable, higher income taxes payable, and higher deferred income taxes.\nThe decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by lower accounts\npayable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory), partially offset by higher net earnings in the\nyear.\nAccounts payable leverage was 99%, 105%, and 150% as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021,\nrespectively. The decrease in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by shorter\npayment terms. The decrease in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by\nhigher merchandise receipts to support higher sales and to replenish our packaway inventory.\nAs a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise\npurchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory. Packaway merchandise\nis purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway\ninventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store\nmerchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase,\nbut typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory\nopportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2022, packaway inventory was 40% of\ntotal inventory compared to 40% and 38% at the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n36\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $654.1 million, $557.8 million, and $405.4 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively, and was related to capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures include costs to build, expand, and improve\ndistribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information\ntechnology systems and buying and corporate offices.\nThe increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher capital\nexpenditures related to the construction of 99 new stores compared to 65 in the prior year, the refresh and enhancement of our\nexisting stores, the construction of our Buckeye, Arizona distribution center, and the investments in various information\ntechnology systems, partially offset by the lower expenditures related to our Brookshire, Texas distribution center which opened\nin the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was\nprimarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures as a result of the resumption of capital projects deferred during fiscal\n2020.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:\n($ millions) 2022 2021 2020\nNew stores $ 170.9 $ 124.9 $ 81.1\nExisting stores 147.6 103.3 54.8\nInformation systems, corporate, and other 65.4 50.3 38.3\nDistribution and transportation 270.2 279.3 231.2\nTotal capital expenditures $ 654.1 $ 557.8 $ 405.4\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are projected to be approximately $810 million. Our planned capital expenditures for fiscal\n2023 are for investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth, including construction of our next distribution centers,\ncosts for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, investments in information\ntechnology systems, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, and buying and corporate\noffices. We expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash. The increase in our planned capital expenditures for fiscal\n2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily driven by investments in our next distribution centers, existing store improvements,\ninformation technology systems, and various expenditures related to distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by\nfinancing activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020. The increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2022 compared to\nfiscal 2021 was primarily due to stock repurchases under our current $1.9 billion stock repurchase program. The decrease in\ncash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the completion of our public debt\nofferings, net of refinancing costs in fiscal 2020, the resumption of our stock repurchases in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the\nresumption of cash dividend payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and the repayment of our Series B unsecured Senior\nNotes.\nRevolving credit facilities. In February 2022, we entered into a new, $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement\n(the “2022 Credit Facility”), which replaced our previous $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of January 28, 2023,\nwe had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility, the $1.3 billion credit facility\nremained in place and available, and we were in compliance with the financial covenant. Refer to Note D: Debt in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSenior notes. As of January 28, 2023, we had approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding unsecured Senior Notes. Refer to Note\nD: Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n37\nOther financing activities. In March 2019, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $2.55 billion stock repurchase program\nthrough fiscal 2020. Due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nsuspended that stock repurchase program as of March 2020, at which time we had repurchased $1.407 billion under the $2.55\nbillion stock repurchase program.\nIn May 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through fiscal\n2022.\nIn March 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of our common stock\nthrough fiscal 2023. This new program replaced the previous $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, effective at the end of fiscal\n2021 (at which time we had repurchased $650 million under the previous $1.5 billion program).\nWe repurchased 10.3 million, 5.7 million, and 1.2 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of\napproximately $950 million, $650 million, and $132 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2022, 2021,\nand 2020, we also acquired 0.5 million shares in each year of treasury stock from our employee equity incentive plans, for\naggregate purchase prices of approximately $48.9 million, $57.3 million, and $45.2 million, respectively.\nOn February 28, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.335 per common share, payable on\nMarch 31, 2023. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.310 per common share in March, May, August, and\nNovember 2022 and a cash dividend of $0.285 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2021. Prior to fiscal\n2021, our most recent quarterly dividend was a quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per common share declared by our Board of\nDirectors in March 2020. In May 2020, we temporarily suspended our quarterly dividends due to the economic uncertainty\nstemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid dividends of $431.3 million, $405.1 million, and $101.4 million, respectively.\nShort-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from\ncustomary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from\nall sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank credit facility, and other credit sources to meet our\ncapital and liquidity requirements, including for lease and interest payment obligations.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from\noperations. During fiscal 2020, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from\noperations and by our long-term debt financing.\nWe ended fiscal 2022 with $4.6 billion of unrestricted cash balances, which were held primarily in overnight money market funds\ninvested in U.S. treasury and government instruments across a highly diversified set of banks and other financial institutions. We\nalso have $1.3 billion available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We estimate that existing cash and cash\nequivalent balances, cash flows from operations, bank credit facility, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash\nneeds and to fund our planned capital investments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the\nnext 12 months.\n38\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of January 28, 2023:\nLess than Greater than\n($000) 1 year 1 year Total¹\nRecorded contractual obligations:\nSenior notes $ — $ 2,474,991 $ 2,474,991\nOperating leases 684,987 2,612,652 3,297,639\nNew York buying office ground lease2 7,552 1,109,430 1,116,982\nUnrecorded contractual obligations:\nReal estate obligations3 13,167 262,651 275,818\nInterest payment obligations 80,316 435,134 515,450\nPurchase obligations4 3,387,014 68,507 3,455,521\nTotal contractual obligations $ 4,173,036 $ 6,963,365 $ 11,136,401\n1 We have a $57.4 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheets. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated.\n2 Our New York buying office building is subject to a 99-year ground lease.\n3 Minimum lease payments for operating leases signed that have not yet commenced.\n4 Purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, transportation,\ninformation technology services, store fixtures and supplies, and maintenance contracts.\nSupply chain finance program. We facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “program”) to provide certain\nsuppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to a participating financial institution at the sole discretion of both\nthe suppliers and the financial institution. A third party administers the program; our responsibility is limited to making payment on\nthe terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution.\nWe do not enter into financial agreements with the participating financial institution in connection with the program. The range of\npayment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program.\nAll outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe amounts owed to a participating financial institution under the program and included in Accounts payable were $119.2\nmillion and $272.7 million at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively. We account for all payments made under the\nprogram as a reduction to operating cash flows in Accounts payable within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The\namounts settled through the program and paid to the participating financial institution were $777.5 million and $430.1 million\nduring fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. We use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition\nto a funded trust to collateralize some of our insurance obligations. We also use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving\ncredit facility to collateralize some of our trade payable obligations. As of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, we had $2.6\nmillion and $3.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding and $57.8 million and $56.7 million, respectively, in a\ncollateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted\ncash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nTrade letters of credit. We had $7.6 million and $19.3 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 28, 2023 and\nJanuary 29, 2022, respectively.\nOther than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as\nof January 28, 2023.\n39\nOther\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical\nexperience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting\nestimates describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates.\nMerchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis)\nor net realizable value. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, transportation, processing, and storage costs related to\npackaway inventory. Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage\nreserve is based on historical shortage rates as determined through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle\ncounts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our provision for shortage to be reliable. As a\nmeasure of sensitivity, a five percent change in shortage rates as of January 28, 2023 would not have materially impacted our\ncost of goods sold in fiscal 2022.\nInsurance obligations. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities,\nincluding workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible\nliability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater\namount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our\nrecorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. A five percent increase or decrease in our\ninsurance reserves would not have materially impacted our net earnings in fiscal 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion\nof recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press\nreleases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking\nstatements regarding, without limitation, projected sales, costs and earnings, planned new store growth, capital expenditures, the\ncontinuing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions and our plans and responses to them,\nsustainability and carbon reduction targets, and other matters. These forward-looking statements reflect our then-current beliefs,\nplans, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and competitive position.\nThe words “plan,” “expect,” “target,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,” “looking ahead,” and\nsimilar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\nFuture impact from inflation, interest rate increases, ongoing military conflicts and economic sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic,\nclimate change, and other economic, regulatory, and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, operating\nconditions, and growth are difficult to predict. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could\ncause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations, plans, and\nprojections. Refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of risk\nfactors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts and plans are dynamic and subject to change. As a\nresult, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our\noutlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.\n40\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for\ntrading or speculative purposes.\nWe occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward\ncontracts as of January 28, 2023.\nInterest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in\nmarket interest rates. As of January 28, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of January 28, 2023, we have outstanding seven series of unsecured Senior Notes. Interest that is payable on all series of\nour Senior Notes is based on fixed interest rates, and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates.\nWe receive interest on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in\nthe future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material negative impact\non our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments\nas of and for the year ended January 28, 2023.

statements.\n45\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness. Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand\nand designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal 2022, the Company\noperated 1,693 Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 322 dd’s\nDISCOUNTS® stores in 21 states. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores are supported by the Company’s headquarters,\nbuying offices, and its network of distribution centers/warehouses.\nBasis of presentation and fiscal year. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company\nfollows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the\nSaturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021 are referred\nto as fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively, and were 52-week years.\nUse of accounting estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The\nCompany’s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory, packaway and other inventory carrying\ncosts, useful lives of fixed assets, insurance reserves, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and legal claims. The uncertainties\nand potential impacts from macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, increase the challenge of making these estimates; actual\nresults could differ materially from the Company’s estimates.\nSegment reporting. The Company has one reportable segment. The Company’s operations include only activities related to off-\nprice retailing in stores throughout the United States.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original\nmaturity of three months or less. The institutions where these instruments are held could potentially subject the Company to\nconcentrations of credit risk. The Company manages its risk associated with these instruments by primarily holding its cash and\ncash equivalents across a highly diversified set of banks and other financial institutions.\nRestricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments serve as collateral\nfor certain insurance obligations and has also served as collateral for certain trade payable obligations of the Company. These\nrestricted funds are invested in bank deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. Government and agency securities, and\ncorporate securities and cannot be withdrawn from the Company’s account without the prior written consent of the secured\nparties. The classification between current and long-term is based on the timing of expected payments of the obligations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the amounts shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,551,876 $ 4,922,365 $ 4,819,293\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents included in:\nPrepaid expenses and other 12,677 11,403 85,711\nOther long-term assets 47,688 48,614 48,765\nTotal restricted cash and cash equivalents 60,365 60,017 134,476\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 4,612,241 $ 4,982,382 $ 4,953,769\nThe Company had no restricted investments as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021.\n46\nEstimated fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term\ninvestments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts\npayable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. Refer to Note B: Fair Value Measurements and\nNote D: Debt for additional information.\nCash and cash equivalents were $4.6 billion and $4.9 billion at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively, and\ninclude bank deposits and money market funds for which the fair value was determined using quoted prices for identical assets\nin active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.\nMerchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or\nnet realizable value. The Company purchases inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway\nmerchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of\npackaway inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix, seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the\nCompany’s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and\nseasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Merchandise inventory includes\nacquisition, transportation, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. The cost of the Company’s\nmerchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the\nCompany’s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.\nCost of goods sold. In addition to product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution, and freight\nexpenses, as well as occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying, and\ndistribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost\nof operating the Company’s distribution centers, warehouses, and cross-dock facilities.\nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three\nyears to 12 years for equipment, 20 years to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, and three years to seven years for\ncomputer software costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. The cost of leasehold improvements is\namortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Depreciation and amortization expense\non property and equipment was $394.7 million, $360.7 million, and $364.2 million for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company capitalizes interest during the construction period of facilities and during the development and implementation\nphase of software projects. Interest capitalized was $5.7 million, $14.5 million, and $12.3 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. As of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the Company had $71.0 million, $47.3 million,\nand $56.2 million, respectively, of property and equipment purchased but not yet paid. These purchases are included in Property\nand Equipment and in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term assets. Other long-term assets as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2022 2021\nDeferred compensation (Note G) $ 155,496 $ 163,891\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 47,688 48,614\nOther 28,899 28,776\nTotal $ 232,083 $ 241,281\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Property and other long-term assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. For stores that are closed, the Company records an impairment\ncharge, if appropriate, or accelerates depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Intangible assets that are not subject\nto amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset may be impaired. No material impairment charges were recorded during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nAccounts payable. Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable\nincludes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash\nbalances in such accounts of approximately $110.6 million and $99.1 million at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022,\nrespectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.\n47\nInsurance obligations. The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management\nactivities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and\ndeductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-\ninsurance and deductible reserves as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2022 2021\nWorkers’ compensation $ 80,275 $ 83,771\nGeneral liability 48,754 45,589\nMedical plans 9,650 7,660\nTotal $ 138,679 $ 137,020\nWorkers’ compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in Accrued payroll and benefits and accruals for\ngeneral liability are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2022 2021\nIncome taxes (Note F) $ 57,409 $ 65,359\nDeferred compensation (Note G) 155,496 163,891\nOther 11,199 6,763\nTotal $ 224,104 $ 236,013\nLease accounting. As the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the\nestimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in\ndetermining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use\nassets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and\nassumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is\nthe rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease\nterm. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably\ncertain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with\nterms of 12 months or less and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company’s\nlease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Refer to\nNote E: Leases for additional information.\nRevenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of sales taxes collected and an allowance for\nestimated future returns as required by Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers, or Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. The Company recognizes allowances for estimated sales returns\non a gross basis as a reduction to sales. The asset recorded for the expected recovery of merchandise inventory was\n$11.8 million, $10.5 million, and $10.7 million and the liability recorded for the refund due to the customer was $23.1 million,\n$20.3 million, and $21.2 million as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Sales taxes\ncollected that are outstanding and the allowance for estimated future returns are included in Accrued expenses and other and\nthe asset for expected recovery of merchandise is included in Prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSales of stored value cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. The Company’s\nstored value cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon historical redemption rates, a small percentage of stored value\ncards will never be redeemed, which represents breakage. Breakage is estimated and recognized as revenue based upon the\nhistorical pattern of customer redemptions. Breakage was not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2022,\n2021, and 2020.\n48\nThe following sales mix table disaggregates revenue by merchandise category for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 1 2021 2020\nHome Accents and Bed and Bath 26% 26% 28%\nLadies 24% 25% 23%\nMen’s 15% 14% 14%\nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Cosmetics 14% 14% 14%\nShoes 12% 12% 12%\nChildren’s 9% 9% 9%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nStore pre-opening. Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses. Advertising costs for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $66.5 million, $65.1 million, and $42.5 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation. The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all\nstock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. Refer to Note C: Stock-Based Compensation, for more information on the\nCompany’s stock-based compensation plans.\nTaxes on earnings. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which\nrequires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been\nrecognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the\nCompany generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 clarifies the\ncriteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s\nconsolidated financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not and a measurement\nstandard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Refer to Note F: Taxes on Earnings for additional information.\nTreasury stock. The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax\nwithholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\nEarnings per share (“EPS”). The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by\ndividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed\nby dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan\nawards and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock and restricted stock\nunits. For periods of net loss, basic and diluted EPS are the same as the effect of the assumed vesting of restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, and performance share awards are anti-dilutive.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 there were 11,100, 3,500, and 79,500 weighted-average shares, respectively, that were excluded\nfrom the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:\nEffect of dilutive\ncommon stock Diluted\nShares in (000s) Basic EPS equivalents EPS\n2022\nShares 343,452 1,770 345,222\nAmount $ 4.40 $ (0.02) $ 4.38\n2021\nShares 351,496 2,238 353,734\nAmount $ 4.90 $ (0.03) $ 4.87\n2020\nShares 352,392 2,227 354,619\nAmount $ 0.24 $ — $ 0.24\n49\nRecently issued accounting standards. In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU\n2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, to\nenhance transparency about an entity’s use of supplier finance programs. The ASU requires enhanced and additional\ndisclosures about the key terms of supplier finance programs including a description of where in the financial statements any\nrelated amounts are presented. The initial guidance in the ASU will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company will begin adopting ASU 2022-04 as\nrequired at the beginning of fiscal 2023 and does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial statement disclosures.\nRecently adopted accounting standards. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic\n832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, to increase the transparency of the effects of government\nassistance, including disclosure of the types of assistance an entity receives, an entity’s method of accounting for government\nassistance, and the effect of government assistance on an entity’s financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2021-10 on\na prospective basis as of January 28, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2021-10 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\ndisclosures as of January 28, 2023.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASU 2019-12\neliminates certain exceptions in ASC 740 related to the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period. It also\nclarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal\nyears, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including\nadoption in any interim period. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The\nmost significant impact to the Company is the removal of a limit on the tax benefit recognized on pre-tax losses in interim\nperiods. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s fiscal 2020 results.\nNote B: Fair Value Measurements\nAccounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs\nused in measuring fair value. The inputs used to measure fair value include: Level 1, observable inputs such as quoted prices in\nactive markets; Level 2, inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3, unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. This fair value hierarchy requires the Company to develop\nits own assumptions and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring\nfair value. Corporate, U.S. government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2\nbecause these securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\nobservable inputs.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial instruments as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 are as follows:\n($000) 2022 2021\nCash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 4,551,876 $ 4,922,365\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 60,365 $ 60,017\nThe underlying assets in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation program as of January 28, 2023 and January 29,\n2022 (included in Other long-term assets and Other long-term liabilities) primarily consist of participant-directed money market,\nstock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement for funds with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) are as\nfollows:\n($000) 2022 2021\nLevel 1 $ 155,496 $ 163,891\n50\nNote C: Stock-Based Compensation\nFor fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nRestricted stock $ 85,092 $ 72,210 $ 66,908\nPerformance awards 32,484 57,582 30,506\nEmployee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) 4,360 4,425 4,154\nTotal $ 121,936 $ 134,217 $ 101,568\nCapitalized stock-based compensation cost was not significant in any year.\nAt January 28, 2023, the Company had one active stock-based compensation plan (further described in Note H: Stockholders’\nEquity). The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the\npurchase date.\nTotal stock-based compensation recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2022, 2021, and\n2020 is as follows:\nStatements of Earnings Classification ($000) 2022 2021 2020\nCost of goods sold $ 67,141 $ 66,500 $ 52,267\nSelling, general and administrative 54,795 67,717 49,301\nTotal $ 121,936 $ 134,217 $ 101,568\nThe tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $24.8 million, $25.6 million,\nand $20.6 million, respectively.\n51\nNote D: Debt\nLong-term debt. Unsecured senior debt (the “Senior Notes”), net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, as of\nJanuary 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2022 2021\n3.375% Senior Notes due 2024 $ 249,257 $ 248,808\n4.600% Senior Notes due 2025 697,161 695,888\n0.875% Senior Notes due 2026 496,038 494,814\n4.700% Senior Notes due 2027 239,899 239,470\n4.800% Senior Notes due 2030 132,602 132,431\n1.875% Senior Notes due 2031 495,254 494,691\n5.450% Senior Notes due 2050 146,299 146,223\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,456,510 $ 2,452,325\nInterest on all Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in April and October and all Senior Notes are subject to prepayment\npenalties for early payment of principal.\nAs of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, total unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were $18.5 million and $22.7\nmillion, respectively, and were classified as a reduction of long-term debt.\nAs of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the seven outstanding series of Senior Notes was\napproximately $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The fair value is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes which\nare considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.\nThe following table shows scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt:\n($000)\n2024 $ 250,000\n2025 $ 700,000\n2026 $ 500,000\n2027 $ 241,786\nThereafter $ 783,205\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nInterest expense on long-term debt $ 84,558 $ 88,286 $ 88,544\nInterest expense on short-term debt — — 7,863\nOther interest expense 1,668 1,351 3,908\nCapitalized interest (5,678) (14,476) (12,251)\nInterest income (77,706) (833) (4,651)\nInterest expense, net $ 2,842 $ 74,328 $ 83,413\nRevolving credit facilities. In February 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a new, $1.3 billion senior\nunsecured revolving Credit Agreement (the “2022 Credit Facility”). The 2022 Credit Facility replaced the Company’s previous\n$800 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was entered into in July 2019 (the “Prior Credit Facility”). The 2022 Credit\nFacility expires in February 2027 and may be extended at the Company’s option for up to two additional one year periods subject\nto customary conditions. The new facility contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. It also contains\nan option allowing the Company to increase the size of its credit facility by up to an additional $700 million, with the agreement of\nthe committing lenders. The interest rate on borrowings under the 2022 Credit Facility is a term rate based on the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) (or an alternate benchmark rate, if Term SOFR is no longer available) plus an\napplicable margin and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. The 2022 Credit Facility is subject to a quarterly Consolidated\nAdjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR financial leverage ratio covenant. As of January 28, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with this financial covenant.\n52\nAs of January 28, 2023, the Company had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility\nand the $1.3 billion credit facility remained in place and available.\nIn March 2020, the Company borrowed $800 million, available under its Prior Credit Facility. Interest on the loan was based on\nLIBOR plus 0.875% (or 1.76%). In October 2020, the Company repaid in full the amount it had borrowed under the Prior Credit\nFacility.\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. The Company uses standby letters of credit outside of its revolving credit facility\nin addition to a funded trust to collateralize some of its insurance obligations. The Company has also used standby letters of\ncredit outside of its revolving credit facility to collateralize some of its trade payable obligations. As of January 28, 2023 and\nJanuary 29, 2022, the Company had $2.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit and $57.8 million and\n$56.7 million, respectively, in a collateral trust.

The Company had $7.6 million and $19.3 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 28,\n2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively.\nNote E: Leases\nThe Company currently leases its store locations with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from three years to\nten years. Store leases typically contain provisions for three to four renewal options of five years each. The exercise of lease\nrenewal options is at the sole discretion of the Company. Most store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for\npayment of variable lease costs. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of\nsales (“percentage rent”) and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company’s lease\nagreements do not contain any material residual guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company does not have any\nfinancing leases.\nThe Company leases certain distribution/warehouse facilities with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2029 and the majority\ncontain renewal provisions. The Company also leases office space for its Los Angeles and Boston buying offices. The lease\nterms for these facilities expire in 2027 and 2024, respectively. The Los Angeles buying office facility contains renewal\nprovisions. In addition, the Company has a ground lease related to its New York buying office.\nThe following table presents net operating lease cost included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for fiscal 2022, 2021,\nand 2020:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease cost1 $ 721,340 $ 687,187 $ 669,339\nVariable lease costs2 206,262 194,112 172,036\nNet lease cost3 $ 927,602 $ 881,299 $ 841,375\n1 Net of sublease income which was immaterial.\n2 Includes property and rent taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, percentage rent, and rent abatements negotiated due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic.\n3 Excludes short-term lease costs which were immaterial.\n53\nThe maturity of operating lease liabilities, including the ground lease related to the New York buying office as of January 28,\n2023, are as follows:\n($000) Operating Leases1\n2023 $ 692,539\n2024 696,514\n2025 591,229\n2026 476,484\n2027 365,013\nThereafter 1,592,842\nTotal lease payments $ 4,414,621\nLess: interest 1,164,684\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 3,249,937\nLess: current operating lease liabilities 655,976\nNon-current operating lease liabilities $ 2,593,961\n1 Operating leases exclude $275.8 million of minimum lease payments for leases signed that have not yet commenced.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate for operating leases as of January 28, 2023\nand January 29, 2022 are as follows:\n2022 2021\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years):\nIncluding the long-term ground lease related to the New York buying office 10.0 10.2\nExcluding the long-term ground lease related to the New York buying office 5.5 5.6\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nIncluding the long-term ground lease related to the New York buying office 3.5% 3.2%\nExcluding the long-term ground lease related to the New York buying office 3.1% 2.8%\nThe following table presents cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities and operating\nlease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities (includes new leases and remeasurements or modifications of\nexisting leases) for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 701,478 $ 745,110 $ 554,620\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 705,220 $ 545,401 $ 610,552\nNote F: Taxes on Earnings\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nCurrent\nFederal $ 338,479 $ 442,152 $ 44,164\nState 57,552 78,024 4,563\n396,031 520,176 48,727\nDeferred\nFederal 74,062 21,103 (27,487)\nState 5,355 (5,328) (325)\n79,417 15,775 (27,812)\nTotal $ 475,448 $ 535,951 $ 20,915\n54\nThe provision for taxes for financial reporting purposes is different from the tax provision computed by applying the statutory\nfederal income tax rate.

The state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2023.\nThe changes in amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (gross of federal tax benefits and excluding interest and penalties) at fiscal\n2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:\n($000) 2022 2021 2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits - beginning of year $ 60,547 $ 60,240 $ 59,887\nGross increases:\nTax positions in current period 10,132 10,381 12,310\nTax positions in prior period 672 1,494 2,860\nGross decreases:\nTax positions in prior periods (6,808) (1,795) (2,624)\nLapse of statutes of limitations (9,989) (9,757) (9,861)\nSettlements (1,010) (16) (2,332)\nUnrecognized tax benefits - end of year $ 53,544 $ 60,547 $ 60,240\n55\nAt the end of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits were $60.6 million, $68.1 million, and $67.9\nmillion inclusive of $7.1 million, $7.6 million, and $7.7 million of related reserves for interest and penalties, respectively. The\nCompany accounts for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for taxes on earnings.\nIf recognized, $48.7 million would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The difference between the total amount of\nunrecognized tax benefits and the amounts that would impact the effective tax rate relates to amounts attributable to deferred tax\nassets and liabilities. These amounts are net of federal and state income taxes.\nIt is reasonably possible that certain federal and state tax matters may be concluded or statutes of limitations may lapse during\nthe next twelve months. Accordingly, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $13.5 million.\nThe Company is open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2019 through\n2022. The Company’s state income tax returns are generally open to audit under the various statutes of limitations for fiscal\nyears 2018 through 2022.

On May 17, 2017, the Company’s stockholders approved the Ross Stores, Inc. 2017 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) which replaced the Company’s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (“Predecessor Plan”). The 2017 Plan,\nwhich was authorized to issue a maximum of 12.0 million shares, was immediately effective upon approval and no further\nawards were granted under the Predecessor Plan, which was terminated.\nThe 2017 Plan has an initial share reserve of 12.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock which can be increased by a\nmaximum of 5.5 million shares from certain expired, withheld, or forfeited shares from the 2017 Plan or the Predecessor Plan.\nThe 2017 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may potentially include the grant of stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares,\nperformance units, and deferred compensation awards. As of January 28, 2023, there were 8.9 million shares available for grant\nunder the 2017 Plan.\nA summary of restricted stock and performance share award activity for fiscal 2022 is presented below:\nWeighted-average\nNumber of grant date\nshares (000) fair value\nUnvested at January 29, 2022 4,378 $ 99.58\nAwarded 1,535 89.40\nReleased (1,340) 90.96\nForfeited (630) 91.38\nUnvested at January 28, 2023 3,943 $ 99.69\nAll unvested shares at January 28, 2023 are only subject to service vesting conditions. The market value of shares of restricted\nstock and performance shares at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period of generally three to five\nyears. The unamortized compensation expense at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was $183.2 million and $181.8\nmillion, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.8 years for both years.\nIntrinsic value for unvested restricted stock, defined as the closing market value per share on the last business day of fiscal year\n2022 (or $119.48), applied to the unvested shares was $471.1 million. A total of 8.9 million, 9.3 million, and 10.2 million shares\nwere available for new restricted stock awards at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

On termination of Mr. Ferber’s\nconsultancy with the Company, the Company will pay Mr. Ferber $75,000 per year for a period of 10 years.\nMr. Ferber’s son, Robert Ferber, is a Vice President, Divisional Merchandise Manager with the Company. The Company paid\nRobert Ferber compensation including salary and bonus of approximately $254,000 and $248,000 in fiscal 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nNote J: Litigation, Claims, and Assessments\nLike many retailers, the Company has been named in class/representative action lawsuits, primarily in California, alleging\nviolations by the Company of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws. Class/representative action litigation remains\npending as of January 28, 2023.\nThe Company is also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions\nfiled against the Company may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental,\nand labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that the\nCompany violated federal, state, and/or local laws. Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these\nproceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.\nIn the opinion of management, the resolution of currently pending class/representative action litigation and other currently\npending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of\noperations, or cash flows.\n58\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ross Stores, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nJanuary 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’\nequity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021 and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal\nyears ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial\nreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\n“Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these\nfinancial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\n59\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are\nno critical audit matters.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 27, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1982.\n60\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving their objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at that reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport.\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part\nupon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nestablished by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) as set forth in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28,\n2023.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023 has also been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, and their opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting is stated in their report, dated March 27, 2023, which is included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be\nnoted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon\ncertain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nQuarterly Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation\nof our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022\nthat has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that\nevaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone\n61\nITEM 9C.

Since then,\nwe have met customer wants and needs by consistently offering\noutstanding value on a wide array of fresh name brand fashions in\nconvenient and easy-to-shop stores.\nWe accomplish this through our two off-price apparel and home\nfashion chains, Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS®.\nThe first Ross Dress for Less locations opened in 1982, and today,\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the\nU.S. with 1,628 stores in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and\nGuam. We launched dd’s DISCOUNTS in 2004 and it now operates\n295 locations in 21 states.\nRoss offers name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home\nfashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department\nstore and specialty store regular prices every day. dd’s DISCOUNTS\nfeatures more moderately-priced assortments at savings of 20%\nto 70% off moderate department and discount store prices every\nday. With the continued careful execution of our off-price strategies,\nwe remain confident in our prospects for ongoing profitable market\nshare gains.\n2021 Annual Report | 1\nMERCHANDISE MIX\n9%\n12% 26%\nHome Accents, Bed and Bath\nLadies\nMen’s\nAccessories, Lingerie,\n14%\nFine Jewelry, and Cosmetics\nShoes\nChildren’s\n25%\n14%\n2 | Ross Stores Inc.\nTO OUR\nSTOCKHOLDERS\nWe made significant progress in fiscal 2021 as we continued to\nnavigate through the external challenges caused by the ongoing\nCOVID pandemic and its effect on the macro-economic and retail\nenvironment. Despite continued headwinds from supply chain\ndisruptions, higher expenses, and inflationary pressures, we are pleased\nto report that both sales and earnings significantly outperformed our\nexpectations for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022.\nFiscal 2021 Financial Results\nGiven the unprecedented effect on our business and financial\nresults in fiscal 2020, when all stores were closed for a portion of\nthe year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our results for fiscal 2021\nare presented versus fiscal 2019.\nTotal sales for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022 were $18.9\nbillion, up from $16.0 billion for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2020.\nComparable sales for the 2021 fiscal year grew 13% over the same\nperiod in fiscal 2019. Earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $4.87 on\nnet income of $1.72 billion, up from $4.60 per share on net earnings\nof $1.66 billion in 2019.\nOperating margin of 12.3% in fiscal 2021 was down 110 basis points\nfrom 13.4% in 2019 mainly due to expense headwinds from higher\nwages, supply chain, and COVID-related costs.\n2021 Annual Report | 3\ndd’s DISCOUNTS 2021 Performance\nSimilar to Ross, while dd’s DISCOUNTS posted healthy sales gains\nin fiscal 2021, its profitability was also impacted by cost pressures\nrelated to wages, supply chain, and COVID.\nContinued Expansion with Higher Long-Term Store Potential\nDuring 2021 we opened a total of 64 net new stores, consisting of\n43 Ross Dress for Less and 21 dd’s DISCOUNTS. We ended the year\nwith a total of 1,923 locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia,\nand Guam.\nLooking ahead, given consumers’ increased focus on value and\nconvenience, we have seen favorable sales trends in both our new\nand in-fill market stores. As a result, along with the large number\nof brick-and-mortar retail closures and bankruptcies over the last\nseveral years, we now believe that Ross Dress for Less can expand\n4 | Ross Stores Inc.\nto about 2,900 locations, up from our prior target of 2,400, and that\ndd’s DISCOUNTS can eventually become a chain of approximately\n700 stores versus our previous projection of 600. This represents\nan overall 20% increase in our forecasted potential to 3,600 stores,\nproviding substantial runway for expansion relative to our year-end\nstore count of 1,923 locations.\nStrong Cash Flows Fund Growth and Stock Repurchases\nand Dividends\nOperating cash flows helped to fund new store expansion and\nadditional infrastructure improvements in 2021. We invested approximately\n$560 million in capital projects during the year, including $330 million for\ndistribution, information technology, and other projects, and $230 million\nto open new locations and update existing stores. We ended the year\nwith about $4.9 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in long-term debt.\n2021 Annual Report | 5\nSTORE\nGROWTH\n40\nSTATES\n1,923\nSTORES\n$18.9B\nANNUAL\nREVENUE\n64\nNET NEW\nSTORES IN 2021\n6 | Ross Stores Inc.\nIn 2021 we opened 43 net new Ross Dress for Less in both established\nregions as well as newer markets, including a total of 13 Ross stores\nin Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Ohio.\ndd’s DISCOUNTS’ store growth included the addition of 21 new\nlocations across seven states, also in both existing and newer\nmarkets, including Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,\nLouisiana, and Texas.\nWe ended the year with 1,628 Ross Dress for Less stores in\n40 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 295 dd’s\nDISCOUNTS in 21 states.\nRoss Dress for Less\ndd’s DISCOUNTS\n2021 Annual Report | 7\nTo maximize our ability to capture profitable market share, we plan\nto make further investments over the next few years in our supply\nchain to support long-term growth and in technology to further\nincrease efficiencies throughout the business.\nIn March of 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors\nhad recently authorized a new two-year program to repurchase\nup to $1.9 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2023. This\nauthorization replaced the $850 million remaining under the prior\nbuyback announced in May 2021. A total of $650 million of common\nstock was repurchased under the previous program in 2021. The\nBoard also increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend by\n9% to $.31 per share.\nThe increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs\nreflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing stockholder value\nand returns, confidence in our projected future cash flows as well\nas the strength of our balance sheet.\nSocial Responsibility at Ross\nFor almost 40 years, our Associates have played an essential role in\nour ability to deliver great values to our customers. As a Company,\nwe are committed to promoting an inclusive culture that values and\ncelebrates the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of our\napproximately 100,000 Associates and those who shop with us.\nWe also recognize that ensuring an inclusive work environment where\nall Associates are treated with dignity and respect is key to their ability\nto grow, succeed, and contribute to the communities where they live\nand work. To support this, we launched additional employee resource\ngroups (known at Ross as “CommUnity Networks”) to help Associates\nconnect with one another and support our ongoing diversity, equality,\nand inclusion efforts, with more Networks to come in 2022.\n8 | Ross Stores Inc.\n$14.1\n17 18 19 20 21\n$15.0\n$16.0\n$12.5\n$18.9\nTotal Sales (in billions)\n$3.55\n17 18 19 20 21\n$4.26\n$4.60\n$0.24\n$4.87\nEarnings Per Share1\nDespite the ongoing inability to hold in-person meetings and trainings\nin 2021, we maintained our commitment to associate development\nwith digital learning and engagement opportunities.

BUSINESS\nRoss Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion\nstores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS®.\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,628 locations in 40 states, the District of\nColumbia, and Guam, as of January 29, 2022. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel,\naccessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store\nregular prices every day. Ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households.\nWe also operate 295 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states as of January 29, 2022. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more\nmoderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family\nat savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS\nstore is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood, and its target\ncustomers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than Ross customers.\nThe merchant, store field, and distribution operations for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS are separate. The two chains share certain\ncorporate and support services.\nBoth our Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS brands target value-conscious customers. The decisions we make, from merchandising,\npurchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer profiles. We believe that both brands derive\na competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories, in organized and\neasy-to-shop store environments.\nOur mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:\n• Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.\n• Meet customer needs on a local basis.\n• Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.\n• Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020 as fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and\nfiscal 2019, respectively, each of which were 52-week years.\nMerchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing\nWe seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel,\naccessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty\nstore regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s\nDISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is on trend and fashionable in each category. New\nmerchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review\ntheir merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the\nmarket. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a\ntreasure-hunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name\nbargains for the family and the home.\nMerchandising. Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase\nadvance-of-season, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally\nrecognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally\nleave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell.\nWe have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we offer fewer\nclassifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a\nwide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. Our merchandise offerings\n14\ninclude, but are not limited to, apparel (including footwear and accessories), small furniture, home accents, bed and bath, beauty,\ntoys, luggage, gourmet food, cookware, jewelry and watches.\nPurchasing. We have a large network of merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and\nbelieve we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our\nmerchandise directly from manufacturers. Despite the ongoing supply chain congestion, we have been able to sufficiently source\nmerchandise inventory.\nWe believe our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a\nnumber of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day\nrelative to department and specialty stores for Ross, and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By\npurchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage\nof imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.\nUnlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances,\nco-op advertising allowances, return privileges, split shipments, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise.\nFor most orders, delivery is made to one of our distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to\nobtain significant discounts on purchases.\nThe merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer and\nbrand overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season (“close-out” purchases), and production direct from\nbrands and factories (“upfront” purchases). We also source merchandise under in-house brands or vendor brands. Merchandise\ncan be shipped to stores in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods into our stores at great values, or can be stored as\npackaway merchandise.\nPackaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be\nthe beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the\npercentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. The timing of the release\nof packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation\nto our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of\npurchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months.\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available\nin the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately 40% and 38% of total inventories as of January 29, 2022 and\nJanuary 30, 2021, respectively. We believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of\nour business results.\nOur primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation’s two largest apparel markets. We also\noperate a smaller buying office located in Boston. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently,\nsourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to\nstrengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.\nAt the end of fiscal 2021, we had over 900 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd’s\nDISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, and each includes merchandise management, buyers, and\nassistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average seven years of experience, including merchandising\npositions with other retailers. We expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to\nfurther develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to\nprocure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.\nThe off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net\nprices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net\nprices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.\nPricing. We sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular\nprices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20% to 70% below most moderate\ndepartment and discount store regular prices. Our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as\nwell as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate\ndepartment and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.\n15\nOur pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices\nand mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and\ncompelling value. On a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the\nrate of sale, as well as at the end of fashion seasons, to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the\nflow of fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate\ndepartment and discount stores.\nStores\nAs of January 29, 2022, we operated a total of 1,923 stores comprised of 1,628 Ross stores and 295 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nOur stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and\nsuburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, we cluster Ross stores to benefit from\neconomies of scale in advertising, distribution, and field management. We do the same for dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nWe believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS is our organized, attractive, and easy-to-shop\nin-store environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure-hunt\nshopping experience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing\nrooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a\nracetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department.\nWe enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers. Our stores have\nshopping carts and/or baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store\nexits for customer ease and efficient staffing. In response to the health pandemic from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we\nhave implemented enhanced safety protocols for our customers and associates.\nWe accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered)\nreturned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with\nstore credit.\nOperating Costs\nConsistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the\nfactors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores\ndue to a store design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies; economies of\nscale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and purchasing\ndecisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats.\nIn response to COVID-19, we implemented additional processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing, to enhance\ncleaning and sanitation activities, and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates, which has increased our\noperating costs. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur elevated operating costs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInformation Systems\nWe continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years.\nCurrent initiatives include continued enhancements to our stores, distribution, merchandising, merchandise planning, and\ncybersecurity systems. These initiatives support future growth, the execution and achievement of our plans, ongoing stability and\ncompliance.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores. These distribution\ncenters are large, highly automated, and built to suit our specific off-price business model. We also operate warehouse facilities\nfor packaway storage.\nWe utilize a combination of our own, and third-party, cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis.\nShipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location.\n16\nWe believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate\nprocessing and storage capacity to support our current store growth. Information on the size and locations of our distribution\ncenters and warehouse facilities is found under “Properties” in Item 2.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising for Ross Dress for Less relies on a mix of television and digital channels to communicate the Ross value\nproposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day. This strategy reflects our\nbelief that a mix of channels is necessary to reach our customer. Within digital channels, we continue to grow social, digital\nvideo, and audio, to communicate our brand position. Advertising for dd’s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on radio, both\nbroadcast and digital, social media, and new store grand openings.\nTrademarks\nThe trademarks for ROSS®, Ross Dress For Less®, and dd’s DISCOUNTS® have been registered with the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office.\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 29, 2022, we had approximately 100,000 total associates, which includes both full- and part-time associates.\nAdditionally, we hire temporary associates, especially during peak seasons. We have no associates that are covered by a\ncollective bargaining agreement. Management considers the relationship between the Company and our associates to be good.\nOur associates play essential roles in delivering great value to our customers. Throughout our organization, we recognize and\nappreciate the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing our associates and we have a number of key programs to do\nso.\nTalent development. The professional growth of our associates is important to our success as a business. We identify and\nenumerate key competencies we believe are critical to our ability to execute our business model and deliver the values our\ncustomers expect. We utilize these competencies in the hiring, development, evaluation, and future planning of our teams. We\nprovide training opportunities to help associates grow and build their careers. Our associates, managers, and executives may\nparticipate in technical and leadership development activities. We support associates interested in leadership roles by offering\nopportunities to gain experience and build the skills necessary to advance within the Company. We are proud that many store\nleaders started their careers with us as retail associates.\nDiversity, equality, and inclusion. We care about our associates and the communities we serve. We are committed to building\ndiverse teams and an inclusive culture that respects, values, and celebrates the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of\nthose who work and shop with us. We are focused on executing strategies to support our commitment to diversity, equality, and\ninclusion.\nCommunity and social impact. We provide our associates the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social\nimpact through various programs such as our matching gift program, volunteer time off for eligible associates, and a scholarship\nprogram for our associates and their dependents.\nCompetition\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant\ndiscounts on brand name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and\nconsistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we continue to make\nstrategic investments in our merchandising organization. We also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems\nto strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product to our stores. We operate in an attractive sector of retail that we\nanticipate will be facing reduced brick and mortar competition given the significant number of recent retail closures and\nbankruptcies. We believe that we remain well-positioned within the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry to compete\nbased on these factors.\n17\nNevertheless, the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging macro-economic and retail\nenvironment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers, department stores, specialty stores, discount\nstores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large\nnational or regional chains that have substantially greater resources. The retail apparel and home-related businesses may\nbecome even more competitive in the future.\nAvailable Information\nThe internet address for our corporate website is www.rossstores.com.

RISK FACTORS\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2021, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press\nreleases, and other investor communications, including those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements\nwith respect to anticipated future events, including the rapidly developing challenges (and our plans and responses) from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, our future financial performance, operations, competitive position, and\nour projected growth, that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from\nthose forward-looking statements and from our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected\nby a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the\nfollowing:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our sales and our operations, and we expect it to continue to\nhave adverse effects on our business and our financial performance.\nThe United States and other countries continue to experience a prolonged, major global COVID-19 pandemic, including\nadditional outbreaks driven by new virus variants, with related, significant disruptions and impacts to retail operations and supply\nchains, and to general economic activities. The situation continues to be unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown\nduration and severity.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our customers and associates may be affected by future recommendations and/or\nmandates from federal, state, and local authorities to stay home, to avoid non-essential social contact and gatherings of people,\nand to self-quarantine. While a significant and increasing portion of the population is vaccinated or may have acquired some\nlevel of immunity after recovering from illness, it will take more time for those factors to reach levels that permit a return to\npre-pandemic levels of social activity. Additional outbreaks and spreading of the disease have been occurring across the United\nStates, and levels of spread have gone up and down in different regions. Government authorities in affected regions have in the\npast taken actions, sometimes drastic and including mandatory capacity restrictions, reduced operating hours, and closure of\nretail operations, in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. We may still face required store closures and distribution\ncenter closures, nationally, regionally, or in specific locations.\nWe have a concentration of store locations in the states of California, Texas, and Florida; together those states include almost\nfifty percent of our stores. More than half of our distribution centers and warehouses are located in California. A severe outbreak\nor a required closure affecting these facilities would be very disruptive to our ability to supply merchandise to our stores. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic may potentially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff our distribution centers, our stores, and our\nmerchant and other support operations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted multiple countries, leading to supply\nrelated disruptions, including port of exit/entry congestion, shipping delays, and ocean freight cost increases, which may also\nadversely affect our ability to access and ship products from affected regions.\nThe prolonged, widespread pandemic has adversely impacted global economies, which has resulted in an economic downturn.\nAn economic rebound is resulting in rising inflation that may reduce consumer demand for our products, and also increase our\ncosts. The extent and duration of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend\nlargely on future developments, including the duration and spread of outbreaks within the U.S., regional surges in infection,\nvaccination rates, potential acquired immunity, the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling current and future variants of the virus,\n18\nthe response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the resulting economic\ndisruptions, and the related impact on consumer confidence, shopping behavior, and spending, all of which are highly uncertain\nand cannot be predicted. Such impacts have and are expected to adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, financial results,\nand our capital resources.\nWe are subject to impacts from the macro-economic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical\nconditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The COVID-19 pandemic and\naccompanying economic impacts, including supply chain disruptions and inflation, and the developing Russia-Ukraine\nconflict and accompanying economic impacts, may have prolonged and significant negative effects on consumer\nconfidence, shopping behavior, and spending, which may adversely affect our sales and gross margins.\nConsumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors. Currently, the repercussions from the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic present significant risks and uncertainty. There is significant uncertainty over potential changes in\nconsumer behavior and shopping patterns as the pandemic continues and as different regions experience surges.\nCurrently, there is also a rapidly developing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has already escalated into a significant military\nconfrontation, and is resulting in major, potentially prolonged economic sanctions and other responses from the United States\nand other countries, which present significant risks and uncertainties. These events may cause various adverse macro-economic\neffects, including increases in fuel and energy prices and depressed financial markets.\nOther factors include levels of unemployment, the size and timing of federal stimulus programs, salaries and wage rates,\nprevailing economic conditions, increasing inflation, rising interest rates, recession and fears of recession, housing costs, energy\nand fuel costs, income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds, consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security,\navailability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, and the resulting effects on consumers’ disposable income and consumer\nconfidence in future economic conditions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and other potential, adverse developments in any of these areas, could\nreduce demand for our merchandise, increase our cost of goods, freight cost, and payroll costs, decrease our inventory turnover,\ncause greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins. All of our stores are located in the United States and its\nterritories, so we are especially susceptible to changes in the U.S. economy.\nWe need to successfully operate under the health and safety measures implemented in our stores and distribution\ncenters, and across all our operations, to comply with regulatory requirements and with the goal of keeping our\ncustomers and associates safe from the spread of the COVID-19 virus without disruptions to our operations.\nWe have implemented a variety of measures in our store locations, distribution centers, and other facilities, with the goal of\nkeeping our associates, customers, and the communities we serve safe from spreading the COVID-19 virus. These measures\ninclude additional cleaning and sanitation of stores and workspaces, providing associates with personal protective equipment\nbased on CDC or other federal, state, or local health guidelines, and implementing physical distancing practices, in our stores,\ndistribution centers, and in our other operations. This is very challenging to do, and there is significant risk, incremental costs,\nand uncertainty regarding changing requirements. Not only are these measures evolving, but they often require change to\nestablished habits and patterns of behavior by large groups of people, who may not fully understand or agree with the requested\nchanges. Whatever measures we adopt, there will also be challenges in effecting consistent compliance by our customers and\nour associates. We are adapting and changing these measures as we learn from experience. And despite our efforts and best\nintentions, incidents of infection will occur at our stores, distribution centers, and/or in our other facilities, potentially resulting in\nserious illness for those affected, including our associates. This may result in required temporary closure of specific stores,\ndistribution centers, or other facilities, and in temporary or longer term loss of key personnel during illness, and potential supply\nchain disruptions. We may also face claims (with or without merit) that our retail stores or our other facilities and workplaces are\noperating in an unsafe manner or are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such incidents may adversely\naffect our operating results, increase our costs, and damage our reputation and competitive position.\nCompetitive pressures in the apparel and home-related merchandise retailing industry are high.\nThe retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented, as many different retailers compete for market\nshare by utilizing a variety of store and on-line formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase in the\nfuture. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. We compete for customers, associates,\nstore locations, and merchandise with many other local, regional, and national retailers, traditional department stores, upscale\nmass merchandisers, other off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail\ncommerce. Our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing, business strategies, and promotional activity (particularly during\nholiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. The substantial sales growth in\ne-commerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models, and an\nincrease in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful on-line shopping alternatives. Intense\n19\npressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, or a failure to\neffectively execute our off-price model, could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause us to\ntake greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins.\nUnexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and home-related merchandise\ncould adversely affect us.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand. We work on an\nongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences, and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer\nneeds. It is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the\nmultiple markets in which we operate throughout the United States and its territories. Although our off-price business model\nprovides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise\nmix to ever-changing consumer tastes, our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer\ntrends and preferences, particularly in our newer geographic markets. Failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends,\npreferences, and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and\nother merchandise, and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our\nstores.\nUnseasonable weather and prolonged, extreme temperatures, as well as events such as storms, affect consumers’ buying\npatterns and willingness to shop, and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and\nseasonal merchandise. Among other things, weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or\nrequire us to close certain stores temporarily, thereby reducing store traffic. Even if stores are not closed, many customers may\nbe unable to go, or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather. As a result, adverse or unseasonable weather in any of\nour markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns, which may negatively affect our sales\nand margins.\nIn order to achieve our planned gross margins, we must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory\nshortage. As a result of changes in shopping behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions to supply chains\nand store operations, and inflation, we are at risk for inventory imbalances and the potential for higher than normal\nlevels of markdowns to sell through our inventory, increased cost of goods, and for lost sales due to insufficient\ninventory to meet customer demand, any of which would negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results.\nWe purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans. If our actual demand is lower than our sales plans, we may\nexperience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, resulting in decreased\nprofit margins. Inflation may cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned, and we may not be able to sell\nthe inventory to our customers at correspondingly increased prices, resulting in decreased profit margins. We also may have\ninsufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying\neconomic impacts may change shopping behavior so that our predictions and sales plans become less accurate, and that may\nlead us to have higher than usual levels of slow-moving or non-salable inventory at our prior planned price levels. We would then\nneed to aggressively and progressively reduce our selling prices in order to clear out that inventory, which would result in\ndecreased profit margins or losses on sales of that inventory, and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\nAs a regular part of our business, we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until\na later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality\nof the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans, but it typically remains in storage less than six\nmonths. Packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory. If we make packaway purchases that do\nnot align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores, we could have significant inventory markdowns.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow. Although we have various systems to help protect\nagainst loss or theft of our inventory, both when in storage and once distributed to our stores, we may have damaged, lost, or\nstolen inventory (called “shortage”) in higher amounts than we forecast, which would result in write-offs, lost sales, and reduced\nmargins.\nWe depend on the market availability, quantity, and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable\ndiscounts, and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment\nof merchandise at competitive prices.\nOpportunistic buying, lean inventory levels, and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our off-price business strategy.\nMaintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and\nsustain our sales and gross margins. Our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants, who are in the\nmarketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season. Our ability to meet\nor exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous, sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that\n20\nwe can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers. To\nthe extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess\ninventory, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. To the extent that certain of our\nvendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be\nmaterially reduced. Because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other\ncountries, constraints on the availability of shipping capacity, changes in transportation costs or in U.S. tariffs, trade relationships,\nor tax policies, and natural disasters, or public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future\npandemics), that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods, could also result in disruptions to our existing\nsupply relationships. Shortages, delays, or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality, value-priced merchandise would\nlikely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins.\nInformation or data security breaches, including cyber-attacks on our transaction processing and computer information\nsystems, could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer, credit card, employee, or other private and\nvaluable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business, disrupt our operations, damage our\nreputation, and increase our costs.\nLike other large retailers, we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process, transmit, and\nstore payment card and other personal and confidential information, and to provide information or data security for those\ntransactions. Some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check\napprovals, and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards, are controlled by the banking and payment card\nindustry, not by us. Cybercriminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate\ncustomer or business information, including but not limited to credit/debit card, personnel, or trade information. Cybercriminals\n(including state-sponsored actors) may attempt to penetrate our information systems to deprive us from access to necessary\nbusiness information and to disrupt our operations, as part of so-called “ransomware” extortion activity or otherwise. Despite\nsecurity measures we have in place, and our efforts to prevent, monitor, and mitigate attacks and errors, our facilities and\nsystems (or those of third-party service providers we utilize or connect to) may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of\nvandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, phishing, ransomware attacks, and\nsimilar fraudulent attacks, or other similar events. It is also possible that an associate within our Company, or a third party we do\nbusiness with, may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information. The increasing\nsophistication of cybercriminals, the increased potential for cyberattacks, and the advances in computer capabilities and remote\naccess increases these risks. A breach of our information or data security, a system shut down or other response we may take,\nor our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information, could result in damage to our\nreputation, loss of customer confidence, violation (or alleged violation) of applicable laws (including laws relating to consumer\ndata protection and privacy, and required notifications of data security breaches), and expose us to civil claims, litigation, and\nregulatory action, and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations.\nDisruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver\nproduct to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nVarious information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business. We depend on the\nintegrity, continuous availability, and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores, track inventory\nflow, manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics, generate performance and financial reports, and support\nmerchandising decisions.\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace information\nprocesses and systems that are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose sound investments and implement\nthem at the right pace. The risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken. An\nexcessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to\nrealize benefits from new technology. Poorly targeting opportunities, failing to make good investments, or making an investment\ncommitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business\nand results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system\nchanges could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide us with the\nanticipated benefits, or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.\nOur information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer\nand telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events\nsuch as severe storms, fires, earthquakes, floods, acts of terrorism, and design or usage errors by our employees or by third\nparties. If our information systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make\nsignificant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material\ninterruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n21\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport\nmerchandise to our stores or our distribution centers, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and\nresult in lost sales or increased supply chain costs. Such disruptions may result from public health issues such as the current\nCOVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics), cyberattacks, damage or destruction to our distribution centers,\nweather-related events, natural disasters, trade restrictions, tariffs, third-party strikes or ineffective cross dock operations, work\nstoppages or slowdowns, shipping capacity constraints, supply or shipping interruptions, or other factors beyond our control. Any\nsuch disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nWe need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth.\nSuccessful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas. We compete with other retailers\nand businesses for acceptable store locations. For the purpose of identifying locations we rely, in part, on consumer\ndemographics. While we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations, we recognize that\nthis information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy. Time frames for\nnegotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected\ncancellations. We may not be able to open new stores or, if opened, operate those new stores profitably. Construction and other\ndelays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to\nrenegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results. New stores may not achieve the same\nsales or profit levels as our existing stores, and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability\nof other existing stores. If we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the\neconomics of our new stores in various markets.\nTo achieve growth, we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets.\nOur growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and in new geographic regions.\nThere are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets.\nStores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have\nhigher construction, occupancy, advertising, or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our\noverall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes, and discretionary spending patterns that\nare more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in\nnew markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional\nactivity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate, and retain qualified associates.\nConsumer problems or legal issues involving the quality, safety, or authenticity of products we sell could harm our\nreputation, result in lost sales, and/or increase our costs.\nVarious governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell. These regulations and related laws\nfrequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. Because of our opportunistic buying\nstrategy, we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before. Although\nour vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our\nvendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety\nand other laws, vendor non-compliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls, make certain\nproducts unsalable, or require us to incur significant compliance costs.\nRegardless of fault, any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer (particularly products such\nas food and children’s items), issues with the authenticity of merchandise, or our inability or that of our vendor to comply on a\ntimely basis with laws and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, result in lost sales, inventory write-offs,\nuninsured product liability or other legal claims, penalties or losses, merchandise recalls, and increased costs.\nAn adverse outcome in various legal, regulatory, or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our\ncosts.\nAs an ordinary part of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, tax audits, and/or other\nlegal matters. These may include lawsuits, inquiries, demands, or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and\nprivate plaintiffs, including those relating to employment and employee benefits (including classification, employment rights,\ndiscrimination, harassment, wage and hour, and retaliation), securities, real estate, tort, commercial, consumer protection,\nprivacy, product compliance and safety, advertising, environmental, comparative pricing, product labeling, intellectual property,\ntax, escheat, and whistle-blower claims. We continue to be involved in a number of employment-related lawsuits, including\nclass/representative actions which are primarily in California.\n22\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local rules and regulations in the United States, and to various international laws, which\nchange from time to time. These legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, including the cost of\nhealth care, workforce management and employee benefits, minimum wages, advertising, comparative pricing, import/export,\nsourcing and manufacturing, data protection (including customer and associate data privacy, choice and notification rights),\nintellectual property, and others. If we fail to comply (or are alleged not to comply) with any of these requirements, we may be\nsubject to fines, settlements, penalties, or other costs. In addition, an adverse outcome (or the adverse publicity from the claims)\nin any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax\nreturns and reports by federal, state, and local tax authorities, and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims. Actual results may\ndiffer and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes. In addition, applicable\naccounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and those changes could have material effects on our\nreported operating results and financial condition.\nDamage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nOur reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity. Any incident that erodes the\ntrust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business, particularly if the\nincident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Such an incident could also include alleged acts or\nomissions by or situations involving our suppliers (or their contractors or subcontractors), the landlord for our stores, or our\nassociates outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. The use of\nsocial media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications which allow\nindividuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, continues to increase. The availability of\ninformation (whether correct or erroneous) on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Many social media\nplatforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of\nthe content. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily\navailable. Information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be\nadverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could negatively affect our sales, diminish customer trust, reduce employee\nmorale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates. The harm may be immediate,\nwithout affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nOur inability to continually attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our off-price\nretail strategies along with labor shortages, increased turnover, or increased labor costs could adversely affect our\noperating results.\nLike other retailers, we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization, management,\nstores, distribution centers, and other key areas. Many of our retail store associates are in entry level or part-time positions with\nhistorically high rates of turnover. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing\nwage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or\nhealthcare benefits.\nAny increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or, if we fail to pay such higher wages, may result in increased\nturnover. Excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding, hiring, and training new associates. If we cannot\nhire enough qualified associates, or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from third-party providers,\nespecially during our peak seasons, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nBecause of the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must also attract, train, and retain our key associates across the\nCompany, especially within our buying organization. The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or the inability to effectively\nidentify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is no assurance that we\nwill be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse\neffect on our growth, operations, or financial position.\nWe must effectively advertise and market our business.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities, the name recognition\nand reputation of our brands, and the location of our stores. Although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract\ncustomers to our stores, particularly through television and digital channels, our competitors may spend more or use different\napproaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our advertising and other promotional programs may not\nbe effective or may be perceived negatively, or could require increased expenditures, any of which could adversely affect sales\nor increase costs.\n23\nWe are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries.\nRisks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas, compliance with anti-dumping regulations,\neconomic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including shipping capacity limitations, cost increases, inflation,\nrecession, and exchange rate fluctuations), foreign government regulations, employment and labor matters, concerns relating to\nhuman rights, working conditions, and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced, transparency of\nsourcing and supply chains, exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues, consumer perceptions of the safety\nof imported merchandise, wars and fears of war, political unrest, natural disasters, regulations to address climate change, and\ntrade restrictions.\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell (even when we purchase it domestically, often as excess inventory\nsold to us by a domestic vendor) is originally manufactured in other countries. In addition, we directly source a portion of the\nproducts sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in Asia (including China). We also buy products that originate\nfrom foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives. Although our foreign purchases of\nmerchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies\ncould increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors. When we are the importer of record, we may be subject\nto regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer.\nTo the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products, any event\ncausing a disruption, delay, or increase in the cost of imports, including the imposition of import or other restrictions such as\nproduct detention, war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or\nother, future pandemics) could adversely affect our business. The flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely\naffected by global shipping capacity limitations, or by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we\npurchase are manufactured. Trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, applicable to the products we sell could\nalso affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. We\ncannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced, or in which our products are currently\nmanufactured or may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign\ngovernments or the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions.\nWe require our vendors (for both import and domestic purchasing) to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct,\ncompliance, and other requirements, including those relating to environmental, employment and labor (including wages and\nworking conditions), health, safety, and anti-bribery standards. From time to time, our vendors, their contractors, or their\nsubcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws. Although we have\nimplemented policies and procedures to promote compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign\nmarkets and importing merchandise, and to monitor the compliance of our suppliers, this does not guarantee that suppliers and\nother third parties with whom we do business will not violate (or not allegedly violate) such laws and regulations or our policies.\nSignificant or continuing noncompliance (or alleged noncompliance) with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could\nhave a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to claims and liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results\nof operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding apparel and home-related merchandise produced in other countries could\nadversely affect our business.\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries. The U.S. government\nhas at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies, including those with China. This exposes us to\nrisks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise, and creates increased\nuncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships,\nor tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost\nof goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we\nmay fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes.\nIn addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business\ndecisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business\nopportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to\nthose changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our\nprofitability.\n24\nWe may experience volatility in revenues and earnings.\nOur business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and back-to-school seasons, weather, and other factors. Although\nour off-price business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, we may still experience unexpected\ndecreases in sales from time to time, which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins. Significant operating\nexpenses, such as rent expense and associate salaries, do not adjust proportionately with our sales. If sales in a certain period\nare lower than our plans, we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently, which could adversely affect our\noperating results.\nA pandemic, natural or man-made disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores,\noffices, or a distribution center could harm our business.\nOur corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office, 10 distribution centers/warehouses, and approximately 23% of our\nstores are located in California. Natural or other disasters, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics),\nwildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or other extreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions, and\nacts of war or terrorism, or public health issues, in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain, or could\nshut down, damage, or destroy our stores or distribution facilities.\nTo support our continuing operations, our new store and distribution center growth plans, our quarterly dividends, and\nour stock repurchase program, we must maintain sufficient liquidity; the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic\ndisruptions are adding significant uncertainty and challenges.\nWe depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities, and to finance our\noperations, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels, and return value to our stockholders through\ndividends and stock repurchases. While the pandemic continues, disruptions to our operations may occur, nationally, regionally,\nor in specific locations. The situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity. If we are\nunable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities, our growth plans and our financial performance\nwould be adversely affected.\nIf our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely\nimpacted. In addition, if we do not properly allocate our capital resources to maximize returns, our operations, cash flows, and\nreturns to stockholders could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to impacts from instances of damage to our stores and losses of merchandise accompanying protests\nor demonstrations, which may result in temporary store closures.\nThere have been recent demonstrations and protests in cities throughout the United States. While they have generally been\npeaceful, in some locations they have been accompanied by violence, damage to retail stores, and the loss of merchandise.\nWhile generally subject to coverage by insurance, the repair of damage to our stores and replacement of lost merchandise may\nalso increase our costs and temporarily disrupt store operations, and we may incur increased operating costs for additional\nsecurity. Governmental authorities in affected cities and regions may take actions in an effort to protect people and property while\npermitting lawful and non-violent protests, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, which may be disruptive to\nour operations. These activities, governmental responses, and resulting media coverage may also harm consumer confidence\nand perceptions of personal well-being and security, which may negatively affect shopping behavior and our sales.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAt January 29, 2022, we operated a total of 1,923 stores, of which 1,628 were Ross stores in 40 states, the District of Columbia,\nand Guam, and 295 were dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states. All stores are leased, with the exception of two locations which\nwe own.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we opened 44 new Ross stores and closed 1 existing store. The average approximate Ross store size is\n28,000 square feet.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we opened 21 new dd’s DISCOUNTS stores and closed no existing stores. The average approximate dd’s\nDISCOUNTS store size is 23,000 square feet.\n25\nDuring fiscal 2021, no one store accounted for more than 1% of our sales.\nWe carry fire, flood, wind, and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such events.\nOur real estate strategy in 2022 is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate, with the objective to increase\nour market penetration and leverage our overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market. We also\nexpect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2022. Important considerations in evaluating a new store location in\nboth newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics,\ncompetition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate\nacquisitions.\nThe following table summarizes the locations of our stores by state/territory as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021.\nState/Territory January 29, 2022 January 30, 2021\nAlabama 25 24\nArizona 82 81\nArkansas 10 10\nCalifornia 443 431\nColorado 39 38\nDelaware 4 4\nDistrict of Columbia 2 2\nFlorida 231 225\nGeorgia 64 63\nGuam 2 2\nHawaii 22 22\nIdaho 12 12\nIllinois 94 89\nIndiana 28 26\nIowa 6 6\nKansas 12 12\nKentucky 15 15\nLouisiana 21 20\nMaryland 27 26\nMississippi 9 9\nMissouri 30 27\nMontana 6 6\nNebraska 6 5\nNevada 41 40\nNew Jersey 18 18\nNew Mexico 18 18\nNorth Carolina 49 49\nNorth Dakota 3 3\nOhio 11 8\nOklahoma 28 28\nOregon 30 30\nPennsylvania 51 51\nSouth Carolina 30 30\nSouth Dakota 2 2\nTennessee 39 37\nTexas 277 260\nUtah 24 23\nVirginia 41 41\nWashington 45 43\nWest Virginia 2 1\nWisconsin 21 19\nWyoming 3 3\nTotal 1,923 1,859\n26\nWhere possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a\nrelatively short period of time and at reasonable costs in a given market. At January 29, 2022, the majority of our stores had\nunexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years, with three to four renewal options of five years each.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe have been named in class/representative action lawsuits, primarily in California, alleging violations of wage and hour laws\nand consumer protection laws. Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of January 29, 2022.\nWe are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed\nagainst us may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and\nemployment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal,\nstate, and/or local laws. Actions against us are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal\nissues and are subject to uncertainties.\nLike many retailers and other businesses, we have filed a lawsuit as plaintiff against the insurance companies with respect to our\nclaims for insurance coverage for business interruption, property damage, and other losses that we have experienced as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Our suit was filed in Alameda County, California in December 2020. The proceedings remain in early\nstages, and are subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe believe that the resolution of our pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and\nregulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nITEM 4.

RESERVED\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOverview\nRoss Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and\ndd’s DISCOUNTS®. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1,628 locations in 40\nstates, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of January 29, 2022. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer\napparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty\nstore regular prices every day. We also operate 295 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states as of January 29, 2022 that feature a\nmore moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for\nthe entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.\nOur primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and\nfinancial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, and considering the pace and\nmagnitude of the economic recovery as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we are closely monitoring market share trends for the\noff-price industry. We believe our share gains will continue to be driven mainly by continued focus on bringing value and\nconvenience to our consumers. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the trends\ntoward expanding market share of the off-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for\nthe family and home at compelling discounts every day.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020 as fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and\nfiscal 2019, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nWhile the United States and other countries continued to experience the ongoing global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic\nthroughout fiscal 2021, the effects on our operations were less disruptive than in fiscal 2020. All of our store locations and\ndistribution centers remained open and operating throughout fiscal 2021, in contrast to 2020, when our results reflected the\nsignificant revenue decline and other impacts from our chain-wide store closures for approximately half of the first quarter and 25\npercent of the second quarter, as well as mandated occupancy restrictions and reduced operating hours that occurred\nthroughout that year. For fiscal 2021, we compare our results of operations to fiscal 2020 and also to fiscal 2019. We believe the\nextended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020, and the significant disruptions caused by COVID-19 throughout fiscal\n2020, make fiscal 2019 a more useful and relevant basis for comparison to our fiscal 2021 performance in assessing our\nongoing results of operations.\nWe achieved strong sales results in fiscal 2021, which benefited from a combination of government stimulus, increasing\nvaccination rates, diminishing COVID-19 restrictions, pent-up consumer demand, and strong execution of our merchandising\nstrategies. We achieved these results despite the negative impacts from COVID-19 and related variants during fiscal 2021,\nespecially the surge in Omicron cases which depressed in-person shopping behavior during the peak holiday selling period, and\nfrom continued supply chain congestion. Throughout the year, we continued to experience expense pressures from higher\ndomestic freight costs of approximately 95 basis points, primarily due to the ongoing and worsening industry-wide supply chain\ncongestion compared to fiscal 2019. We also incurred ongoing COVID-related increased operating costs of approximately 35\nbasis points (the vast majority of which impacted our selling, general and administrative expenses). We expect higher freight\ncosts, higher distribution expenses, higher wages, and ongoing COVID-related operating costs to continue during fiscal 2022.\nThere remains significant uncertainty related to the ongoing industry-wide supply chain congestion. We also face external risks\nfrom the effects of inflation, both on consumer demand and on costs in our business. In addition, there continues to be significant\nuncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including its unknown duration, the potential for further new virus variants and\nfuture resurgences, as well as possible operational restrictions, the ongoing effect of the pandemic on consumer behavior and\nshopping patterns, and the potential adverse impact on our business.\n32\nThe following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n2021 2020 2019\nSales\nSales (millions) $ 18,916 $ 12,532 $ 16,039\nSales growth (decline) 50.9% (21.9)% 7.0%\nComparable store sales growth 13% 1 n/a 2 3% 3\nCosts and expenses (as a percent of sales)\nCost of goods sold 72.5% 78.5% 71.9%\nSelling, general and administrative 15.2% 20.0% 14.7%\nInterest expense (income), net 0.4% 0.7% (0.1)%\nEarnings before taxes (as a percent of sales) 11.9% 0.8% 13.5%\nNet earnings (as a percent of sales) 9.1% 0.7% 10.4%\n1 Amount shown is for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019. Comparable store sales for this purpose represents sales from stores that\nwere open at the end of fiscal 2019, less stores closed in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021.\n2 Given the temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable store sales metric for fiscal 2020 is not\nmeaningful.\n3 Amount shown is for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 for stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months.\nStores. Total stores open at the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 1,923, 1,859, and 1,805, respectively. The number of\nstores at the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 increased by 3%, 3%, and 5% from the respective prior years. In response to\nthe impacts and uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our pace of new store openings for fiscal 2020 and\nfiscal 2021. Looking forward to 2022, we expect to return to our historical annual opening program of approximately 100 new\nstores. Beyond fiscal 2022, we are planning for our pace of new store openings to be greater than our historical annual opening\nprogram of approximately 100 stores, based on trends we perceive toward consumers’ increased focus on value and\nconvenience, favorable store performance in both our new and in-fill markets, and the market share opportunities resulting from\nthe significant number of brick-and-mortar retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several years. Our longer term strategy\nis to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store\nprofitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and\nopportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based\non similar criteria.\nStore Count and Square Footage 2021 2020 2019\nBeginning of the period 1,859 1,805 1,717\nOpened in the period 65 66 1 98\nClosed in the period (1) (12) (10) 2\nEnd of the period 1,923 1,859 1,805\nSelling square footage at the end of the period (000) 39,900 38,800 37,900\n1 Includes the reopening of a store previously temporarily closed due to a weather event.\n2 Includes the temporary closure of a store impacted by a weather event.\nSales. Sales for fiscal 2021 increased $6.4 billion, or 50.9%, compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to all store\nlocations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of\nour stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period. Sales for fiscal 2021 also benefited from a\ncombination of government stimulus payments, increasing vaccination rates, diminishing COVID-19 restrictions on operations,\npent-up consumer demand, and strong execution of our merchandising strategies. Sales also increased due to the opening of 64\nnet new stores between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021.\n33\nSales for fiscal 2020 decreased $3.5 billion, or 21.9%, compared to fiscal 2019. This was primarily due to the negative impact\nfrom the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period, the\nnegative impacts on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced store\noperating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020. We opened 54 net new stores during 2020. The sales from these new stores\npartially offset the overall sales decline.\nSales for fiscal 2021 increased $2.9 billion, or 17.9%, compared to fiscal 2019, due to a 13% increase in sales from comparable\nstores and the opening of 118 net new stores between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021.\nOur sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n2021 1 2020 2019\nHome Accents and Bed and Bath 26% 28% 25%\nLadies 25% 23% 26%\nMen’s 14% 14% 14%\nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Cosmetics 14% 14% 13%\nShoes 12% 12% 13%\nChildren’s 9% 9% 9%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nWe intend to address the competitive retail climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing\nstrategies, and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization, diversify our merchandise mix, and more fully develop our\nsystems to improve our merchandise offerings.\nIt is difficult to predict any future impact from some of the factors that benefited our sales results for fiscal 2021, in particular the\nbenefit from the government stimulus payments and pent-up consumer demand. There remains significant uncertainty related to\nongoing industry-wide supply chain congestion. We also face external risks from the effects of inflation, both on consumer\ndemand and on costs in our business. In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19\npandemic, including its unknown duration, the potential for new virus variants and future resurgences, as well as possible\noperational restrictions, the ongoing effect of the pandemic on consumer behavior and shopping patterns, and the potential\nadverse impact on our business. We cannot be sure that our strategies and our store expansion program will result in a\ncontinuation of our historical sales growth, or an increase in net earnings.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 increased $3.9 billion compared to the prior year, mainly due to higher\nsales, given that all our stores were open throughout fiscal 2021, compared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related\nclosures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period. Cost of goods also increased due\nto the opening of 64 net new stores between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021.\nCost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased $1.7 billion compared to fiscal 2019, mainly due to the lower sales from the\ntemporary COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March 2020 to June 2020 period, and\nensuing negative impacts on shopping behavior and customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic after our store\nreopenings, as well as lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some\nassociates in our buying offices. These decreases were partially offset by higher markdowns used to clear aged and seasonal\ninventory, higher distribution costs primarily due to increased wages, and higher freight costs due to industry-wide supply chain\ncongestion, added expenditures for COVID-19 related measures, and higher occupancy costs from the opening of 54 net new\nstores during 2020.\nCost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 increased $2.2 billion compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 13% increase in comparable\nstore sales, higher freight and distribution costs primarily due to industry-wide supply chain congestion, and higher wages, and\nhigher sales due to the opening of 118 net new stores between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021.\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 increased approximately 55 basis points from fiscal 2019, primarily\ndue to a 95 basis point increase in domestic freight costs, mainly driven by worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion, a\n30 basis point increase in distribution expenses, mainly driven by higher wages, and a 10 basis point increase in buying costs.\nThese increases were partially offset by leverage of 60 basis points in occupancy costs and a 20 basis point improvement in\nmerchandise gross margin.\nWe expect higher supply chain costs from the industry-wide congestion and higher wages to continue throughout fiscal 2022.\n34\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)\nincreased $371.2 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to all our stores remaining open throughout\nfiscal 2021, compared to the impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the\nMarch 2020 to June 2020 period, and to the opening of 64 net new stores between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, partially offset by\napproximately $240 million in long-term debt refinancing costs incurred in fiscal 2020.\nFor fiscal 2020, SG&A increased $146.6 million compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to approximately $240 million in long-term\ndebt refinancing costs, COVID-related expenses (primarily for supplies, cleaning, and payroll related to additional safety\nprotocols), and payments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)), partially offset by payroll-related cost reduction measures in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic (including the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our stores during closure\nperiods, and some associates in our corporate offices), reductions in non-business critical operating expenses, and lower store\noperating expenses on lower sales.\nFor fiscal 2021, SG&A increased $517.8 million compared to fiscal 2019, mainly due to a 13% increase in comparable store\nsales, the opening of 118 net new stores between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021, higher incentive compensation costs due to better-\nthan-expected results, net COVID-related operating expenses primarily for supplies, cleaning, and payroll related to additional\nsafety protocols, higher wages, and holiday related pay incentives.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 increased by approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due\nto higher incentive compensation costs due to better-than-expected results, net COVID-related operating expenses for supplies,\ncleaning, and payroll related to additional safety protocols, higher wages, and holiday related pay incentives.\nWe expect our operating costs in fiscal 2022 to continue to reflect ongoing COVID-related expenses and also higher wages.\nInterest expense (income), net. In fiscal 2021, net interest expense decreased by $9.1 million compared to 2020 primarily due\nto the elimination of interest expense on short-term debt due to the repayment of our $800 million revolving credit facility in\nOctober 2020 and higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center,\npartially offset by lower interest income due to lower interest rates.\nIn fiscal 2020, net interest expense increased by $101.5 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on\nlong-term debt due to the issuance of Senior Notes in April 2020 and October 2020 (net of repurchase of Senior Notes), lower\ninterest income due to lower interest rates, and higher interest expense on short-term debt due to the draw down on our $800\nmillion revolving credit facility in March 2020 (which was subsequently repaid in October 2020), partially offset by higher\ncapitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center.\nIn fiscal 2021, net interest expense increased by $92.4 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on\nlong-term debt due to the issuance of Senior Notes in April 2020 and October 2020 (net of repurchase of Senior Notes), and\nlower interest income due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction\nof our Brookshire, Texas distribution center.\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n($000) 2021 2020 2019\nInterest expense on long-term debt $ 88,286 $ 88,544 $ 13,139\nInterest expense on short-term debt — 7,863 —\nOther interest expense 1,351 3,908 968\nCapitalized interest (14,476) (12,251) (4,367)\nInterest income (833) (4,651) (27,846)\nInterest expense (income), net $ 74,328 $ 83,413 $ (18,106)\n35\nTaxes on earnings. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were approximately 24%, 20%, and 23%,\nrespectively. The increase in the effective tax rate of 4% for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and the decrease of 3% for fiscal\n2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the impact of hiring tax credits on lower pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2020. The\nincrease in effective tax rate of 1% for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to resolution of uncertain tax\npositions with a state tax authority during fiscal 2019.\nOur effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state\ntaxes deductible on federal returns. Our effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance, location of\nnew stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with share-based compensation, and the resolution of tax positions with\nvarious tax authorities.\nIn fiscal 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act made several significant changes to business tax provisions\nincluding modifications for net operating losses, employee retention credits, and deferral of employer payroll tax payments. The\nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law during fiscal 2020. The CAA made several changes to\nbusiness tax provisions including extending certain employment-related tax credits through December 31, 2025.\nNet earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 were higher than in fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower cost\nof goods sold, lower SG&A expenses, and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher taxes on earnings. Net earnings as a\npercentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, higher SG&A\nexpenses, and higher interest expense. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 were lower than in fiscal 2019,\nprimarily due to higher cost of goods sold, higher SG&A expenses, and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower taxes on\nearnings.\nEarnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was $4.87, compared to $0.24 in the prior year. The higher diluted\nearnings per share in fiscal 2021 were primarily attributable to all our store locations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021,\ncompared to the negative impact from the COVID-19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the March\n2020 to June 2020 period.\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was $0.24, compared to $4.60 in fiscal 2019. The lower diluted earnings per share in\nfiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations during a significant portion of the\nMarch 2020 to June 2020 period and the negative impacts on shopping behavior and customer demand due to the COVID-19\npandemic, higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory, long-term debt refinancing costs, payments to associates\nwhile our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the CARES Act), and higher expenditures for COVID-19\nrelated measures.\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was $4.87, compared to $4.60 in fiscal 2019. The 6% increase in diluted earnings per\nshare for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019, was attributable to a 4% increase in net earnings, and to the reduction in\nweighted-average diluted shares outstanding of 2% for fiscal 2021, largely due to stock repurchases under our stock repurchase\nprograms.\n36\nFinancial Condition\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of funds for our business activities have been cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our\nprimary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease costs, taxes,\nand for capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information\nsystems, and buying and corporate offices. We also use cash to pay dividends, to repay debt as it becomes due, and to\nrepurchase stock under active stock repurchase programs.\n($ millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCash provided by operating activities $ 1,738.8 $ 2,245.9 $ 2,171.5\nCash used in investing activities (557.8) (405.4) (555.0)\nCash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,152.4) 1,701.9 (1,683.2)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents,\nand restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 28.6 $ 3,542.4 $ (66.7)\nIn this report, we compare our cash flows from operating activities to both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. We believe fiscal 2019 is a\nmore useful and relevant basis of comparison given that our stores were open for full 52-week periods in fiscal 2021 and fiscal\n2019. Our cash flows from investing and financing activities are compared to fiscal 2020, given the construction of our\nBrookshire, Texas distribution center during fiscal 2020 and 2021, and the significant financing actions we took in fiscal 2020 to\npreserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2021. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding\nnon-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher merchandise\ninventory receipts net of accounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2020. This was\nprimarily driven by higher accounts payable due to longer payment terms, lower merchandise receipts as we closely managed\ninventory levels and used packaway inventory to replenish our stores, and net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for\ndepreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal\n2019, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based\ncompensation, and for deferred taxes.\nThe decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by lower Accounts\npayable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory), partially offset by higher net earnings in the\ncurrent year. Accounts payable leverage was 105% and 150% as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively. The\ndecrease in Accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by higher merchandise\nreceipts to support higher sales and to replenish our packaway inventory.\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher Accounts\npayable leverage. Accounts payable leverage was 150% and 71% as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively.\nThe increase in Accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and\nin-store inventory and longer payment terms.\nThe decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher\nmerchandise receipts to support higher sales and to replenish packaway inventory, partially offset by higher incentive bonus\naccruals and higher net earnings.\n37\nAs a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise\npurchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory. Packaway merchandise\nis purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway\ninventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store\nmerchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase,\nbut typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory\nopportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2021, packaway inventory was 40% of\ntotal inventory compared to 38% and 46% at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $557.8 million, $405.4 million, and $555.0 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019,\nrespectively, and was related to capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures include costs to build, expand, and improve\ndistribution centers (primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center); open new stores and\nimprove existing stores; and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying and corporate\noffices.\nThe increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in our\ncapital expenditures related to the resumption of capital projects deferred during fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used for\ninvesting activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our actions to preserve our financial liquidity in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. We opened 65, 66, and 98 new stores in fiscal 2021,\n2020, and 2019, respectively.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:\n($ millions) 2021 2020 2019\nNew stores $ 124.9 $ 81.1 $ 137.4\nExisting stores 103.3 54.8 125.3\nInformation systems, corporate, and other 50.3 38.3 91.8\nDistribution and transportation 279.3 231.2 201.0\nTotal capital expenditures $ 557.8 $ 405.4 $ 555.5\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are projected to be approximately $800 million. Our planned capital expenditures for fiscal\n2022 are expected to be used for investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth, including construction of our next\ndistribution center, costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores,\ninvestments in certain information technology systems, and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores,\ndistribution centers, buying, and corporate offices. We expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash. The increase in\nour planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily driven by the upgrade or remodeling of\nexisting stores, costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores,\nconstruction of our next distribution center, investments in information technology systems, and for various other needed\nexpenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying, and corporate offices.\n38\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in\nfiscal 2020. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2019. The decrease in cash provided by financing\nactivities for fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings, net of\nrefinancing costs in fiscal 2020, the resumption of our share repurchases in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the resumption of\ncash dividend payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and the repayment of our Series B unsecured Senior Notes. The\nincrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the completion of\nour public debt offerings, net of repurchase and refinancing costs in fiscal 2020, and the suspension of our share repurchases\nand dividends in the second quarter of 2020.\nRevolving credit facilities. In February 2022 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a new, $1.3 billion senior unsecured\nrevolving Credit Agreement (the “2022 Credit Facility”), which replaced our previous $800 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility (the “Prior Credit Facility”). The 2022 Credit Facility expires in February 2027, and may be extended, at our option, for up\nto two additional one year periods, subject to customary conditions. The new facility contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance\nof standby letters of credit. It also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our credit facility by up to an additional\n$700 million, with the agreement of the committing lenders. The interest rate on borrowings under the 2022 Credit Facility is a\nterm rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) (or an alternate benchmark rate, if Term SOFR is no\nlonger available) plus an applicable margin, and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. The 2022 Credit Facility is subject to a\nquarterly Consolidated Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR financial leverage ratio covenant, effective the first quarter of\nfiscal 2022.\nOn the Effective Date of the 2022 Credit Facility, the Prior Credit Facility was terminated and was replaced by the new 2022\nCredit Facility. As of January 29, 2022, we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Credit\nFacility, the $800 million credit facility remained in place and available, and we were in compliance with the financial covenant.\nIn March 2020, we borrowed $800 million under the Prior Credit Facility. Interest on the loan was based on LIBOR plus 0.875%\n(or 1.76%). In May 2020, we amended the Prior Credit Facility to temporarily suspend for the second and third quarters of fiscal\n2020 the Consolidated Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR ratio financial covenant, and to apply a transitional modification to that ratio,\neffective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In October 2020, we repaid in full the $800 million we borrowed under the Prior\nCredit Facility.\nIn May 2020, we also entered into an additional $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility which was scheduled to\nexpire in April 2021. In October 2020, we terminated this senior revolving credit facility. We had no borrowings under that credit\nfacility at any time.\nSenior notes. In April 2020, we issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in four tenors as follows: $700\nmillion of 4.600% Senior Notes due April 2025, $400 million of 4.700% Senior Notes due April 2027, $400 million of 4.800%\nSenior Notes due April 2030, and $500 million of 5.450% Senior Notes due April 2050.\nIn October 2020, we accepted for purchase approximately $775 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to\ncash tender offers as follows: $351 million of the 2050 Notes, $266 million of the 2030 Notes, and $158 million of the 2027\nNotes. We paid approximately $1.003 billion in aggregate consideration (including transaction costs, and accrued and unpaid\ninterest) and recorded an approximately $240 million loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes.\nIn October 2020, we also issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in two tenors as follows: 0.875% Senior\nNotes due April 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 1.875% Senior Notes due April\n2031 (the “2031 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Cash proceeds, net of discounts and other issuance\ncosts, were approximately $987.2 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 and 2031 Notes to fund the\npurchase of the accepted notes from our tender offers.\nIn December 2021, we repaid at maturity the $65 million principal amount of the Series B 6.530% unsecured Senior Notes.\n39\nOther financing activities. In March 2019, our Board of Directors had approved a two-year $2.55 billion stock repurchase\nprogram through fiscal 2020. Due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nsuspended that stock repurchase program in March 2020, at which time we had repurchased $1.407 billion under the $2.55\nbillion stock repurchase program. In May 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of\nour common stock through fiscal 2022, with plans to buy back $650 million in fiscal 2021 and $850 million in fiscal 2022. In\nMarch 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of our common stock\nthrough fiscal 2023. This new program replaces the previous $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, effective at the end of fiscal\n2021 (at which time we had repurchased $650 million under the previous $1.5 billion program).\nWe repurchased 5.7 million, 1.2 million, and 12.3 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of\napproximately $650 million, $132 million, and $1,275 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We also acquired\n0.5 million, 0.5 million, and 0.6 million shares in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, of treasury stock from our employee\nstock equity compensation programs, for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $57.3 million, $45.2 million, and $60.7\nmillion during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nOn March 1, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.310 per common share, payable on\nMarch 31, 2022. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.285 per common share in March, May, August,\nand November 2021, respectively. Prior to fiscal 2021, our most recent quarterly dividend was a quarterly cash dividend of\n$0.285 per common share declared by our Board of Directors in March 2020. In May 2020, we temporarily suspended our\nquarterly dividends, due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Board of Directors declared\nquarterly cash dividends of $0.255 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2019, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, we paid dividends of $405.1 million, $101.4 million, and $369.8 million, respectively.\nShort-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from\ncustomary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from\nall sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank credit facility, and other credit sources to meet our\ncapital and liquidity requirements, including lease and interest payment obligations.\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2019, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from\noperations. During fiscal 2020, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from\noperations and our long-term debt financing.\nWe ended fiscal 2021 with $4.9 billion of unrestricted cash balances, and as of the Effective Date we have $1.3 billion available\nunder our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We estimate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows\nfrom operations, bank credit facility, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned\ncapital investments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next 12 months.\n40\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of January 29, 2022:\nLess than Greater than\n($000) 1 year 1 year Total¹\nRecorded contractual obligations:\nSenior notes $ — $ 2,474,991 $ 2,474,991\nOperating leases 652,365 2,529,515 3,181,880\nNew York buying office ground lease2 6,274 961,705 967,979\nUnrecorded contractual obligations:\nReal estate obligations3 11,715 241,469 253,184\nInterest payment obligations 80,316 515,450 595,766\nPurchase obligations4 5,026,221 14,991 5,041,212\nTotal contractual obligations $ 5,776,891 $ 6,738,121 $ 12,515,012\n1 We have a $65.4 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated.\n2 Our New York buying office building is subject to a 99-year ground lease.\n3 Minimum lease payments for operating leases signed that have not yet commenced.\n4 Purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, store\nfixtures and supplies, and information technology services, transportation, and maintenance contracts.\nSupply chain finance program. We facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “program”) to provide certain\nsuppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to a participating financial institution at the sole discretion of both\nthe suppliers and the financial institution. A third party administers the program; our responsibility is limited to making payment on\nthe terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution.\nWe do not enter into agreements with the participating financial institution in connection with the program. The range of payment\nterms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program.\nAll outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe amounts owed to a participating financial institution under the program and included in Accounts payable were\n$272.7 million and $15.6 million at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively. We account for all payments made\nunder the program as a reduction to operating cash flows in Accounts payable within the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows. The amounts settled through the program and paid to the participating financial institution were $430.1 million and\n$2.6 million during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. We use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition\nto a funded trust to collateralize some of our insurance obligations. We also use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving\ncredit facility to collateralize some of our trade payable obligations. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, we had\n$3.3 million and $15.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding, and $56.7 million and $56.1 million,\nrespectively, in a collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists\nof restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nTrade letters of credit. We had $19.3 million and $16.3 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 29, 2022 and\nJanuary 30, 2021, respectively.\nOther than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as\nof January 29, 2022.\n41\nOther\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical\nexperience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting\nestimates describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates.\nMerchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis)\nor net realizable value. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, transportation, processing, and storage costs related to\npackaway inventory. Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage\nreserve is based on historical shortage rates as determined through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle\ncounts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our provision for shortage to be reliable. If actual\nmarket conditions are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than\nanticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required beyond our normal markdowns taken to clear\nseasonal and aged inventory. As a measure of sensitivity, a five percent change in shortage rates as of January 29, 2022, would\nnot have materially impacted our cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021.\nLease accounting. In determining the present value of lease payments, for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities\nand right-of-use assets, we use the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the\nlease commencement date. Since our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, this rate is determined using a\nportfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest, and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating,\ncredit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. Changes in these inputs can increase or decrease the recorded\noperating lease assets and related lease liabilities for new leases, and for remeasurements or modifications of existing leases.\nWe believe that this approximates the rate we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a\ncollateralized basis over a similar lease term.\nInsurance obligations. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities,\nincluding workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible\nliability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater\namount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our\nrecorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. A five percent increase or decrease in our\ninsurance reserves would not have materially impacted our net earnings in fiscal 2021.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Recently issued accounting\nstandards and Recently adopted accounting standards) for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2021, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press\nreleases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking\nstatements regarding, without limitation, the rapidly developing challenges and our plans and responses to the COVID-19\npandemic and related economic and supply chain disruptions, including adjustments to our operations, and planned new store\ngrowth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. These forward-looking\nstatements reflect our then current beliefs, plans, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial\nperformance, operations, and competitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “target,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,”\n“forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,” “looking ahead,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\n42\nFuture impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other economic and industry trends that could potentially impact\nrevenue, profitability, operating conditions, and growth are difficult to predict. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks\nand uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our\nprevious expectations, plans, and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete\ndiscussion of risk factors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to\nchange. As a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily\nreflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for\ntrading or speculative purposes.\nWe occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward\ncontracts as of January 29, 2022.\nInterest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in\nmarket interest rates. As of January 29, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of January 29, 2022, we have outstanding seven series of unsecured Senior Notes. Interest that is payable on all series of\nour Senior Notes is based on fixed interest rates, and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates.\nWe receive interest on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in\nthe future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material negative impact\non our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments\nas of and for the year ended January 29, 2022. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from\nreasonably possible, near-term changes in interest rates to be material.\n43\nITEM 8.

to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness. Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand\nand designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal 2021, the Company\noperated 1,628 Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 295 dd’s\nDISCOUNTS® stores in 21 states. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores are supported by the Company’s headquarters,\nbuying offices, and its network of distribution centers/warehouses.\nSegment reporting. The Company has one reportable segment. The Company’s operations include only activities related to\noff-price retailing in stores throughout the United States.\nBasis of presentation and fiscal year. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company\nfollows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the\nSaturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 are referred\nto as fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively, and were 52-week years.\nUse of accounting estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The\nCompany’s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory, packaway and other inventory carrying\ncosts, useful lives of fixed assets, insurance reserves, reserves for uncertain tax positions, employee retention credits under the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), and legal claims. The uncertainties and impacts from the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic increase the challenge of making these estimates; actual results could differ materially from the\nCompany’s estimates.\nPurchase obligations. As of January 29, 2022, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately $5.0 billion. These\npurchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects,\nstore fixtures and supplies, and information technology services, transportation, and maintenance contracts.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original\nmaturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments serve as collateral\nfor certain insurance obligations and has also served as collateral for certain trade payable obligations of the Company. These\nrestricted funds are invested in bank deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. Government and agency securities, and\ncorporate securities and cannot be withdrawn from the Company’s account without the prior written consent of the secured\nparties. The classification between current and long-term is based on the timing of expected payments of the obligations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets that reconcile to the amounts shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n($000) 2021 2020 2019\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,922,365 $ 4,819,293 $ 1,351,205\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents included in:\nPrepaid expenses and other 11,403 85,711 10,235\nOther long-term assets 48,614 48,765 49,970\nTotal restricted cash and cash equivalents 60,017 134,476 60,205\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 4,982,382 $ 4,953,769 $ 1,411,410\nThe Company had no restricted investments as of January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020.\n48\nEstimated fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term\ninvestments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts\npayable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. See Note B and Note D for additional fair value\ninformation.\nCash and cash equivalents were $4,922.4 million and $4,819.3 million, at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively,\nand include bank deposits and money market funds for which the fair value was determined using quoted prices for identical\nassets in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures\nguidance.\nMerchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or\nnet realizable value. The Company purchases inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway\nmerchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of\npackaway inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to\nthe Company’s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and\nseasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Merchandise inventory includes\nacquisition, transportation, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. The cost of the Company’s\nmerchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the\nCompany’s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.\nCost of goods sold. In addition to product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution, and freight\nexpenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying, and\ndistribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost\nof operating the Company’s distribution centers, warehouses, and cross-dock facilities.\nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three\nyears to 12 years for equipment, 20 years to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, and three years to seven years for\ncomputer software costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. The cost of leasehold improvements is\namortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Depreciation and amortization expense\non property and equipment was $360.7 million, $364.2 million, and $350.9 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company capitalizes interest during the construction period of facilities and during the development and implementation\nphase of software projects. Interest capitalized was $14.5 million, $12.3 million, and $4.4 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019,\nrespectively. As of January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020 the Company had $47.3 million, $56.2 million, and\n$40.3 million, respectively, of property and equipment purchased but not yet paid. These purchases are included in Property and\nEquipment and in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term assets. Other long-term assets as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2021 2020\nDeferred compensation (Note B) $ 163,891 $ 159,116\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 48,614 48,765\nOther 28,776 22,180\nTotal $ 241,281 $ 230,061\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Property and other long-term assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. For stores that are closed, the Company records an impairment\ncharge, if appropriate, or accelerates depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Intangible assets that are not subject\nto amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset may be impaired. No material impairment charges were recorded during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nAccounts payable. Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable\nincludes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash\nbalances in such accounts of approximately $99.1 million and $63.5 million at January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021,\nrespectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.\n49\nInsurance obligations. The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management\nactivities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and\ndeductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.\nSelf-insurance and deductible reserves as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2021 2020\nWorkers’ compensation $ 83,771 $ 83,900\nGeneral liability 45,589 42,575\nMedical plans 7,660 7,727\nTotal $ 137,020 $ 134,202\nWorkers’ compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in Accrued payroll and benefits, and accruals for\ngeneral liability are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2021 2020\nIncome taxes (Note F) $ 65,359 $ 65,507\nDeferred compensation (Note G) 163,891 159,116\nDeferred social security taxes — 36,701\nOther 6,763 7,234\nTotal $ 236,013 $ 268,558\nLease accounting. As the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the\nestimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in\ndetermining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use\nassets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and\nassumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is\nthe rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease\nterm. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably\ncertain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with\nterms of 12 months or less, and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company’s\nlease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) provided relief under Accounting\nStandards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Accounting Standards Codification “ASC” 842). Under this relief, companies can\nmake a policy election on how to treat lease concessions resulting directly from the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the\nmodified contracts result in total cash flows that are substantially the same or less than the cash flows in the original contract.\nThe Company made the policy election to account for lease concessions that result from the COVID-19 pandemic as if they were\nmade under enforceable rights in the original contract. Additionally, the Company made the policy election to account for these\nconcessions outside of the lease modification framework described under ASC 842. The Company recorded accruals for\ndeferred rental payments and recognized rent abatements or concessions as variable lease costs in the periods incurred.\nAccruals for rent payment deferrals are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nRevenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of sales taxes collected and an allowance for\nestimated future returns as required by ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The Company\nrecognizes allowances for estimated sales returns on a gross basis as a reduction to sales. The asset recorded for the expected\nrecovery of merchandise inventory was $10.5 million, $10.7 million, and $10.7 million and the liability recorded for the refund due\nto the customer was $20.3 million, $21.2 million, and $20.9 million as of January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1,\n2020, respectively. Sales taxes collected that are outstanding and the allowance for estimated future returns are included in\nAccrued expenses and other and the asset for expected recovery of merchandise is included in Prepaid expenses and other in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n50\nSales of stored value cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. The Company’s\nstored value cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon historical redemption rates, a small percentage of stored value\ncards will never be redeemed, which represents breakage. As a result of adopting ASC 606, breakage is estimated and\nrecognized as revenue based upon the historical pattern of customer redemptions. Breakage was not material to the\nconsolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nThe following sales mix table disaggregates revenue by merchandise category for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n2021 1 2020 2019\nHome Accents and Bed and Bath 26% 28% 25%\nLadies 25% 23% 26%\nMen’s 14% 14% 14%\nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Cosmetics 14% 14% 13%\nShoes 12% 12% 13%\nChildren’s 9% 9% 9%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nStore pre-opening. Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses. Advertising costs for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $65.1 million, $42.5 million, and $74.0 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation. The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all\nstock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based\ncompensation plans.\nTaxes on earnings. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”\nwhich requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have\nbeen recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the\nCompany generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 clarifies the\ncriteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s\nconsolidated financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement\nstandard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. See Note F.\nTreasury stock. The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax\nwithholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\nEarnings per share (“EPS”). The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by\ndividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed\nby dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan\nawards and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock and restricted stock\nunits. For periods of net loss, basic and diluted EPS are the same as the effect of the assumed vesting of restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, and performance share awards are anti-dilutive.\nIn fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 there were 3,500, 79,500, and 27,400 weighted-average shares, respectively, that were excluded\nfrom the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years.\n51\nThe following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:\nEffect of dilutive\ncommon stock Diluted\nShares in (000s) Basic EPS equivalents EPS\n2021\nShares 351,496 2,238 353,734\nAmount $ 4.90 $ (0.03) $ 4.87\n2020\nShares 352,392 2,227 354,619\nAmount $ 0.24 $ — $ 0.24\n2019\nShares 358,462 2,720 361,182\nAmount $ 4.63 $ (0.03) $ 4.60\nComprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes net earnings and components of other comprehensive income (loss),\nnet of tax, consisting of unrealized investment gains or losses.\nRecently issued accounting standards. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance\n(Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, to increase the transparency of government\nassistance including the disclosure of the types of assistance an entity receives, an entity’s method of accounting for government\nassistance, and the effect of government assistance on an entity’s financial statements. The guidance in this Update will be\neffective for the Company for its fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, with early application of the amendments permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently adopted accounting standards. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for\nIncome Taxes (ASC 740). ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions in ASC 740 related to the methodology for calculating\nincome taxes in an interim period. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The\namendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12\non a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The most significant impact to the Company is the removal of a limit on\nthe tax benefit recognized on pre-tax losses in interim periods. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on\nthe Company’s fiscal 2020 results.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which along with subsequent amendments, supersedes\nthe lease accounting requirements in ASC 840, Leases. The updated guidance requires balance sheet recognition for all leases\nwith lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to\nuse, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 as of February 3, 2019 (the “effective date”), using the optional transition method on a modified\nretrospective basis. The Company did not elect the transitional package of practical expedients or the use of hindsight upon\nadoption of the ASC. The Company elected to not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with\nterms of 12 months or less, and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Upon adoption,\nthe Company recorded lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments, using incremental\nborrowing rates as of the effective date, of $2.9 billion, and the corresponding right-of-use assets of $2.9 billion. The Company\nalso recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease beginning retained earnings of $19.6 million, primarily related to the\nwrite-off of previously capitalized initial direct costs that are no longer capitalized under ASC 842, partially offset by the write-off\nof the deferred gain on a previous sale-leaseback transaction that meets the sale definition under ASC 842. Reporting periods\nbeginning on or after February 3, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts and disclosures were not\nadjusted and continue to be reported under ASC 840. Adoption of ASC 842 did not have a significant impact to the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of earnings or to the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n52\nNote B: Fair Value Measurements\nAccounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs\nused in measuring fair value. The inputs used to measure fair value include: Level 1, observable inputs such as quoted prices in\nactive markets; Level 2, inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3, unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. This fair value hierarchy requires the Company to develop\nits own assumptions and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring\nfair value. Corporate, U.S. government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2\nbecause these securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\nobservable inputs.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial instruments as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 are as follows:\n($000) 2021 2020\nCash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 4,922,365 $ 4,819,293\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 60,017 $ 134,476\nThe underlying assets in the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation program as of January 29, 2022 and January 30,\n2021 (included in Other long-term assets and in Other long-term liabilities) primarily consist of participant-directed money market,\nstock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement for funds with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) are as\nfollows:\n($000) 2021 2020\nLevel 1 $ 163,891 $ 159,116\nNote C: Management Incentive Plan and Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has incentive compensation programs which provide cash incentive bonuses and performance share awards to\nkey management and employees based on Company and individual performance.\nFor fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established the performance measures for determining\nincentive compensation amounts based on a combination of profitability-based performance goals and the attainment of specific\nmanagement priorities related to business challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, as measured and approved by the\nCompensation Committee.

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible employees participating in the\nquarterly offering period can choose to have up to the lesser of 10% of their annual base earnings or the IRS annual share\npurchase limit of $25,000 in aggregate market value to purchase the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of the stock\nis 85% of the closing market price on the date of purchase. Purchases occur on a quarterly basis (on the last trading day of each\ncalendar quarter). The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on\nthe purchase date.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, employees purchased approximately 0.3 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million shares,\nrespectively, of the Company’s common stock under the plan at weighted-average per share prices of $99.07, $81.45, and\n$88.45, respectively. Through January 29, 2022, approximately 40.7 million shares had been issued under this plan and\n4.2 million shares remained available for future issuance.\nNote I: Related Party Transactions\nThe Company has a consulting agreement with Norman Ferber, its former Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Directors, under\nwhich the Company paid him $1.8 million, $2.1 million, and $2.1 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition,\nthe agreement provides for administrative support and health and other benefits for him and his dependents, which totaled\napproximately $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, along with amounts to\ncover premiums through May 2022 on a life insurance policy with a death benefit of $2.0 million. Mr. Ferber’s current consulting\nagreement paid him an annual consulting fee of $2.3 million from May 31, 2020 through May 31, 2021 and pays him $1.6 million\nfrom June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022. On termination of Mr. Ferber’s consultancy with the Company, the Company will pay\nMr. Ferber $75,000 per year for a period of 10 years.\nRobert Ferber, the son of Norman Ferber, is a Vice President, Divisional Merchandise Manager with the Company. The\nCompany paid Robert Ferber compensation including salary and bonus of approximately $254,000, $248,000, and $209,000 in\nfiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nNote J: Litigation, Claims, and Assessments\nLike many retailers, the Company has been named in class/representative action lawsuits, primarily in California, alleging\nviolations of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws. Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of\nJanuary 29, 2022.\nThe Company is also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions\nfiled against the Company may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental,\nand labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that the\nCompany violated federal, state, and/or local laws. Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these\nproceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.\nIn the opinion of management, the resolution of pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal\nand regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or\ncash flows.\n62\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ross Stores, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nJanuary 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’\nequity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020 and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal\nyears ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial\nreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\n“Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\n63\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are\nno critical audit matters.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 29, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1982.\n64\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving their objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at that reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport.\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part\nupon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nestablished by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2022.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022 has also been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, and their opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting is stated in their report, dated March 29, 2022, which is included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be\nnoted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon\ncertain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nQuarterly Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation\nof our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021\nthat has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that\nevaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone\n65\nITEM 9C.

BUSINESS\nRoss Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion\nstores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS®.\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,585 locations in 40 states, the District of\nColumbia, and Guam, as of January 30, 2021. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel,\naccessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store\nregular prices every day. Ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households.\nWe also operate 274 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states as of January 30, 2021. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-\npriced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of\n20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS store is located\nin an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically\ncome from households with more moderate incomes than Ross customers.\nThe merchant, store field, and distribution operations for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS are separate. The two chains share certain\ncorporate and support services.\nBoth our Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS brands target value-conscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54. The\ndecisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer\nprofiles. We believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our\nmerchandise categories in organized and easy-to-shop store environments.\nOur mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:\n• Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.\n• Meet customer needs on a local basis.\n• Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.\n• Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019 as fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and\nfiscal 2018, respectively, all of which were 52-week years.\nMerchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing\nWe seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel,\naccessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty\nstore regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s\nDISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category. New\nmerchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review\ntheir merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the\nmarket. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a\ntreasure-hunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name\nbargains for the family and the home.\nMerchandising. Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-\nseason, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally recognized name\nbrands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand\nname label on the merchandise we sell.\nWe have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we offer fewer\nclassifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a\nwide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. Our merchandise offerings\n14\ninclude, but are not limited to, apparel (including footwear and accessories), small furniture, home accents, bed and bath, beauty,\ntoys, luggage, gourmet food, cookware, jewelry and watches.\nPurchasing. We have a large network of merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and\nbelieve we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our\nmerchandise directly from manufacturers, and we have not experienced difficulty in sourcing sufficient merchandise inventory.\nWe believe our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a\nnumber of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day\nrelative to department and specialty stores for Ross, and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By\npurchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage\nof imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.\nUnlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances, co-\nop advertising allowances, return privileges, split shipments, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For\nmost orders, delivery is made to one of our distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain\nsignificant discounts on purchases.\nThe majority of the apparel and apparel-related merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic\npurchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season. These buys are\nreferred to as “close-out” purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods into our\nstores at great values, or can be stored as packaway merchandise.\nPackaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be\nthe beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the\npercentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise\nis mainly fashion basics and, therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends.\nIn fiscal 2020, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available\nin the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately 38% and 46% of total inventories as of January 30, 2021 and\nFebruary 1, 2020, respectively. We believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of\nour business results.\nOur primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation’s two largest apparel markets. We also\noperate a smaller buying office located in Boston. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently,\nsourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to\nstrengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we had over 900 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd’s\nDISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, and each includes merchandise management, buyers, and\nassistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average eight years of experience, including merchandising\npositions with other retailers. We expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to\nfurther develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to\nprocure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.\nThe off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net\nprices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net\nprices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.\nPricing. We sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular\nprices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20% to 70% below most moderate\ndepartment and discount store regular prices. Our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as\nwell as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate\ndepartment and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.\nOur pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices\nand mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and\ncompelling value. On a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the\nrate of sale, as well as at the end of fashion seasons, to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the\nflow of fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate\ndepartment and discount stores.\n15\nStores\nAs of January 30, 2021, we operated a total of 1,859 stores comprised of 1,585 Ross stores and 274 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nOur stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and\nsuburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, we cluster Ross stores to benefit from\neconomies of scale in advertising, distribution, and field management. We do the same for dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nWe believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS is our organized, attractive, and easy-to-shop in-\nstore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure-hunt\nshopping experience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing\nrooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a\nracetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department.\nWe enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers. Our stores have\nshopping carts and/or baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store\nexits for customer ease and efficient staffing. In response to the health pandemic from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we\nimplemented enhanced safety protocols for our customers and associates, including social distancing measures and capacity\nrestrictions.\nWe accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered)\nreturned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with\nstore credit.\nOperating Costs\nConsistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the\nfactors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores\ndue to a store design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies; economies of\nscale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and purchasing\ndecisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats.\nIn response to COVID-19, we implemented additional processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing, to enhance\ncleaning and sanitation activities, and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates, which has increased our\noperating costs. We expect to incur higher operating costs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInformation Systems\nWe continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years.\nRecent initiatives include continued enhancements to our collaboration, cybersecurity, merchandise planning, distribution, store,\nand human resource systems. These initiatives support future growth, the execution and achievement of our plans, ongoing\nstability and compliance, as well as our ability to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores. These distribution\ncenters are large, highly automated, and built to suit our specific off-price business model. An additional distribution center in\nBrookshire, Texas is currently under construction and expected to open in 2022. We also operate warehouse facilities for\npackaway storage.\nWe utilize a combination of our own, and third-party, cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis.\nShipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location.\nWe believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate\nprocessing and storage capacity to support our current store growth. Information on the size and locations of our distribution\ncenters and warehouse facilities is found under “Properties” in Item 2.\n16\nAdvertising\nAdvertising for Ross Dress for Less relies primarily on television to communicate the Ross value proposition—savings off the\nsame brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the\nmost efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position. While television is our primary advertising\nmedium, we continue to grow additional channels, including social and digital media, to communicate our brand position.\nAdvertising for dd’s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on radio, both broadcast and digital, social media, and new store grand\nopenings.\nTrademarks\nThe trademarks for ROSS®, Ross Dress For Less®, and dd’s DISCOUNTS® have been registered with the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office.\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 30, 2021, we had approximately 93,700 total associates, which includes both full- and part-time associates.\nAdditionally, we hire temporary associates, especially during the peak seasons. Our associates are non-union. Management\nconsiders the relationship between the Company and our associates to be good.\nOur associates play essential roles in delivering great value to our customers. Throughout our organization, we recognize and\nappreciate the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing our associates and we have a number of key programs to do\nso.\nTalent development. The professional growth of our associates is important to our success as a business. We identify and\nenumerate key competencies we believe are critical to our ability to execute our business model and deliver the values our\ncustomers expect. We utilize these competencies in the hiring, development, evaluation, and future planning of our teams. We\nprovide training opportunities to help associates grow and build their careers. Our associates, managers, and executives may\nparticipate in technical and leadership development activities. We support associates interested in leadership roles by offering\nopportunities to gain experience and build the skills necessary to advance within the Company. We are proud that many store\nleaders started their careers with us as retail associates.\nDiversity, equality, and inclusion. We care about our associates and the communities we serve. We are committed to building\ndiverse teams and an inclusive culture that respects, values, and celebrates the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of\nthose who work and shop with us. We are focused on executing strategies to support our commitment to diversity, equality, and\ninclusion.\nCommunity and social impact. We provide our associates the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social\nimpact through various programs such as our matching gift program, volunteer time off for eligible associates, and a scholarship\nprogram for our associates and their dependents.\nCompetition\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant\ndiscounts on brand name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and\nconsistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we continue to make\nstrategic investments in our merchandising organization. We also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems\nto strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends. We operate in an\nattractive sector of retail that will be facing much less brick and mortar competition given the significant number of retail closures\nand bankruptcies. We believe that we remain well-positioned within the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry to\ncompete based on these factors.\nNevertheless, the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging macro-economic and retail\nenvironment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers, department stores, specialty stores, discount\nstores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large\nnational or regional chains that have substantially greater resources. The retail apparel and home-related businesses may\nbecome even more competitive in the future.\n17\nAvailable Information\nThe internet address for our corporate website is www.rossstores.com.

RISK FACTORS\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2020, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press\nreleases, and other investor communications, including those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements\nwith respect to anticipated future events, including the rapidly developing challenges with and our plans and responses to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, our future financial performance, operations, competitive position, and\nour projected growth, that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from\nthose forward-looking statements and from our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected\nby a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the\nfollowing:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely and adversely affect our sales and our operations, and we expect it to\ncontinue to have serious adverse effects on our business and our financial performance.\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major, prolonged global COVID-19 pandemic, with related, significant\ndisruptions and restrictions to retail operations and supply chains and to general economic activities, as the affected regions\nhave taken dramatic actions, sometimes including mandatory capacity restrictions, reduced operating hours, and closure of retail\noperations, in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our customers and associates are being impacted by recommendations and/or\nmandates from federal, state, and local authorities to stay home (“shelter in place” or “safer at home”), to avoid non-essential\nsocial contact and gatherings of people, and to self-quarantine. Following a chain-wide closure from late March 2020 to mid-May\n2020, all of our distribution centers and substantially all of our store locations have been operating since the end of June 2020.\nWhile vaccines have become available and a steadily increasing portion of the population is being vaccinated, it will take time for\nthose efforts to reach levels that permit a relaxation in the social restrictions. Additional outbreaks and spreading of the disease\nhave been occurring in many places across the United States, and while levels of spread have gone up and down in different\nregions, health officials continue to warn of further potential disruptions and quarantine responses. State and local “work from\nhome” recommendations and mandates have been in effect for many of our corporate offices, and may continue for some time.\nStore closures and distribution center closures may be required again nationally, regionally, or in specific locations.\nThe situation continues to be unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity. We have a\nconcentration of store locations in the States of California, Texas, and Florida; together those states include almost fifty percent\nof our stores, and they have each reported regional “hot spots” and increasing numbers of cases in recent months, which have\nalready resulted in strict customer capacity limits, limits to our hours of operations and curfews, and in mandatory store closures,\nin certain areas. “Stay at home” measures continue to discourage in-person shopping and to reduce traffic in our stores. More\nthan half of our distribution centers and warehouses are located in California. A required closure of these facilities would be very\ndisruptive to our ability to supply merchandise to our stores. The temporary closure of our stores and distribution centers early in\n2020 resulted in a significant loss of sales and profits and had material adverse effects on our financial condition. In addition, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may potentially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff our distribution centers, our stores, and our\nmerchant and other support operations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted multiple countries, which may\nalso adversely affect our ability to access and ship products from the affected regions.\nThe prolonged, widespread pandemic has adversely impacted global economies, which has resulted in an economic downturn\nthat may reduce consumer demand for our products. The extent and duration of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our\nbusiness and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak\nwithin the U.S., regional surges in infection, the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling the virus or current or future variants of\nthe virus, the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic\ndisruptions, and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be\npredicted. Such impacts have and are expected to adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, financial results, and our capital\nresources.\n18\nWe are subject to impacts from the macro-economic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical\nconditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The COVID-19 pandemic may have\nprolonged and significant negative effects on consumer confidence, shopping behavior, and spending, which may\nadversely affect our sales and gross margins.\nConsumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors. Currently, the repercussions from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic are unknown and present significant risks and uncertainty. There is significant uncertainty over potential\nchanges in consumer behavior and shopping patterns as the pandemic continues and as different regions experience surges.\nOther factors include levels of unemployment, the size and timing of federal stimulus programs, salaries and wage rates,\nprevailing economic conditions, recession and fears of recession, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and the\ntiming of tax refunds, inflation, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, consumer perceptions of personal well-being\nand security, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, and consumers’ disposable income. The COVID-19\npandemic, and other potential, adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise,\ndecrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins. All of our stores are\nlocated in the United States and its territories, so we are especially susceptible to changes in the U.S. economy.\nWe need to successfully operate under the health and safety measures implemented in our stores and distribution\ncenters, and across all our operations, to comply with regulatory requirements and with the goal of keeping our\ncustomers and associates safe from the spread of the COVID-19 virus without disruptions to our operations.\nWe have implemented a variety of measures in our stores locations, distribution centers, and other facilities, with the goal of\nkeeping our associates, customers, and the communities we serve safe from spreading the COVID-19 virus. These measures\ninclude additional cleaning and sanitation of stores and workspaces, return merchandise quarantining, providing associates with\npersonal protective equipment based on CDC or other federal, state, or local health guidelines, and implementing physical\ndistancing practices, in our stores, distribution centers, and in our other operations. This is very challenging to do, and there is\nsignificant risk, incremental costs, and uncertainty regarding requirements and their implementation. Not only are these\nmeasures new and evolving, but they often require change to established habits and patterns of behavior by large groups of\npeople, who may not fully understand or agree with the requested changes. Whatever measures we adopt, there will also be\nchallenges in effecting consistent compliance by our customers and our associates. We will need to adapt and change these\nmeasures over time and as we learn from experience. And despite our efforts and best intentions, incidents of infection will occur\nat our stores, distribution centers, and/or in our other facilities, potentially resulting in serious illness for those affected, including\nour associates. This may result in required temporary closure of specific stores, distribution centers, or other facilities, and in\ntemporary or longer term loss of key personnel during illness, and potential supply chain disruptions. We may also face claims\n(with or without merit) that our retail stores or our other facilities and workplaces are operating in an unsafe manner or are not in\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such incidents may adversely affect our operating results, increase our\ncosts, and damage our reputation and competitive position.\nCompetitive pressures in the apparel and home-related merchandise retailing industry are high.\nThe retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented, as many different retailers compete for market\nshare by utilizing a variety of store and on-line formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase in the\nfuture. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. We compete for customers, associates,\nstore locations, and merchandise with many other local, regional, and national retailers, traditional department stores, upscale\nmass merchandisers, other off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail\ncommerce. Our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing, business strategies and promotional activity (particularly during\nholiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. The substantial sales growth in e-\ncommerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models, and an\nincrease in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful on-line shopping alternatives. Intense\npressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, or a failure to\neffectively execute our off-price model, could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause us to\ntake greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins.\nUnexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and home-related merchandise\ncould adversely affect us.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand. We work on an\nongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences, and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer\nneeds. It is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the\nmultiple markets in which we operate throughout the United States and its territories. Although our off-price business model\nprovides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise\nmix to ever-changing consumer tastes, our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer\ntrends and preferences, particularly in our newer geographic markets. Failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends,\npreferences, and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n19\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and\nother merchandise, and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our\nstores.\nUnseasonable weather and prolonged, extreme temperatures, as well as events such as storms, affect consumers’ buying\npatterns and willingness to shop, and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and\nseasonal merchandise. Among other things, weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or\nrequire us to close certain stores temporarily, thereby reducing store traffic. Even if stores are not closed, many customers may\nbe unable to go, or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather. As a result, adverse or unseasonable weather in any of\nour markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns, which may negatively affect our sales\nand margins.\nIn order to achieve our planned gross margins, we must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory\nshortage. As a result of potential changes in shopping behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential\ndisruptions to supply chains and store operations, we are at risk for inventory imbalances and the potential for higher\nthan normal levels of markdowns to sell through our inventory, which would negatively affect our gross margins and\nour operating results.\nWe purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans. If our actual demand is lower than our sales plans, we may\nexperience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, resulting in decreased\nprofit margins. We also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales opportunities. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic may cause changes in shopping behavior and restrictions on our operations, so that our predictions and\nsales plans are less accurate, and that may lead us to have higher than usual levels of slow-moving or non-salable inventory at\nour prior planned price levels. We would need to aggressively and progressively reduce our selling prices in order to clear out\nthat inventory, which would result in decreased profit margins or losses on sales of that inventory, and adversely affect our\nresults of operations in future periods.\nAs a regular part of our business, we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until\na later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season, but it\ntypically remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory. If\nwe make packaway purchases that do not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores, we could\nhave significant inventory markdowns. Changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow. Although we\nhave various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory, both when in storage and once distributed to our\nstores, we may have damaged, lost, or stolen inventory (called “shortage”) in higher amounts than we forecast, which would\nresult in write-offs, lost sales, and reduced margins.\nWe depend on the market availability, quantity, and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable\ndiscounts, and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment\nof merchandise at competitive prices.\nOpportunistic buying, lean inventory levels, and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our off-price business strategy.\nMaintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and\nsustain our sales and gross margins. Our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants, who are in the\nmarketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season. Our ability to meet\nor exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous, sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that\nwe can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers. To\nthe extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess\ninventory, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. To the extent that certain of our\nvendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be\nmaterially reduced. Because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other\ncountries, constraints on the availability of shipping capacity, changes in transportation costs or in U.S. tariffs, trade relationships,\nor tax policies, and natural disasters, or public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future\npandemics), that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods, could also result in disruptions to our existing\nsupply relationships. Shortages, delays, or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality, value-priced merchandise would\nlikely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins.\n20\nInformation or data security breaches, including cyber-attacks on our transaction processing and computer information\nsystems, could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer, credit card, employee, or other private and\nvaluable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business, disrupt our operations, damage our\nreputation, and increase our costs.\nLike other large retailers, we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process, transmit, and\nstore payment card and other personal and confidential information, and to provide information or data security for those\ntransactions. Some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check\napprovals, and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards, are controlled by the banking and payment card\nindustry, not by us. Cybercriminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate\ncustomer or business information, including but not limited to credit/debit card, personnel, or trade information. Despite security\nmeasures we have in place, and our efforts to prevent, monitor, and mitigate attacks and errors, our facilities and systems (or\nthose of third-party service providers we utilize or connect to) may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism,\ncomputer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, phishing and similar fraudulent attacks, or other\nsimilar events. It is also possible that an associate within our Company, or a third party we do business with, may purposefully or\ninadvertently cause a security breach involving such information. The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and advances\nin computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks. A breach of our information or data security, a system shut\ndown or other response we may take, or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business\ninformation, could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence, violation (or alleged violation) of applicable\nlaws (including laws relating to consumer data protection and privacy, and required notifications of data security breaches), and\nexpose us to civil claims, litigation, and regulatory action, and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations.\nDisruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver\nproduct to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nVarious information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business. We depend on the\nintegrity, continuous availability, and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores, track inventory\nflow, manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics, generate performance and financial reports, and support\nmerchandising decisions.\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace information\nprocesses and systems that are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose sound investments and implement\nthem at the right pace. The risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken. An\nexcessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to\nrealize benefits from new technology. Poorly targeting opportunities, failing to make good investments, or making an investment\ncommitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business\nand results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system\nchanges could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide us with the\nanticipated benefits, or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.\nOur information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer\nand telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as severe\nstorms, fires, earthquakes, floods, acts of terrorism, and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties. If our\ninformation systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant\ninvestments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in\nour computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport\nmerchandise to our stores or our distribution centers, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and\nresult in lost sales or increased supply chain costs. Such disruptions may result from: public health issues such as the current\nCOVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics), damage or destruction to our distribution centers, weather-related events,\nnatural disasters, trade restrictions, tariffs, third-party strikes or ineffective cross dock operations, work stoppages or slowdowns,\nshipping capacity constraints, supply or shipping interruptions, or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruptions could\nnegatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\n21\nWe need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth.\nSuccessful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas. We compete with other retailers\nand businesses for acceptable store locations. For the purpose of identifying locations we rely, in part, on consumer\ndemographics. While we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations, we recognize that\nthis information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy. Time frames for\nnegotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected\ncancellations. We may not be able to open new stores or, if opened, operate those new stores profitably. Construction and other\ndelays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to\nrenegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results. New stores may not achieve the same\nsales or profit levels as our existing stores, and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability\nof other existing stores. If we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the\neconomics of our new stores in various markets.\nTo achieve growth, we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets.\nOur growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and in new geographic regions.\nThere are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets.\nStores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have\nhigher construction, occupancy, advertising, or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our\noverall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes, and discretionary spending patterns that\nare more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in\nnew markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional\nactivity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate, and retain qualified associates.\nConsumer problems or legal issues involving the quality, safety, or authenticity of products we sell could harm our\nreputation, result in lost sales, and/or increase our costs.\nVarious governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell. These regulations and related laws\nfrequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. Because of our opportunistic buying\nstrategy, we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before. Although\nour vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our\nvendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety\nand other laws, vendor non-compliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls, make certain\nproducts unsalable, or require us to incur significant compliance costs.\nRegardless of fault, any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer, particularly products such\nas food and children’s items, issues with the authenticity of merchandise, or our inability, or that of our vendors, to comply on a\ntimely basis with laws and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, result in lost sales, inventory write-offs,\nuninsured product liability or other legal claims, penalties or losses, merchandise recalls, and increased costs.\nAn adverse outcome in various legal, regulatory, or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our\ncosts.\nAs an ordinary part of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, tax audits, and/or other\nlegal matters. These may include lawsuits, inquiries, demands, or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and\nprivate plaintiffs, including those relating to employment and employee benefits (including classification, employment rights,\ndiscrimination, harassment, wage and hour, and retaliation), securities, real estate, tort, commercial, consumer protection,\nprivacy, product compliance and safety, advertising, comparative pricing, product labeling, intellectual property, tax, escheat, and\nwhistle-blower claims. We continue to be involved in a number of employment-related lawsuits, including class/representative\nactions which are primarily in California.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local rules and regulations in the United States, and to various international laws, which\nchange from time to time. These legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, including the cost of\nhealth care, workforce management and employee benefits, minimum wages, advertising, comparative pricing, import/export,\nsourcing and manufacturing, data protection (including customer and associate data privacy, choice and notification rights),\nintellectual property, and others. If we fail to comply (or are alleged not to comply) with any of these requirements, we may be\nsubject to fines, settlements, penalties, or other costs. In addition, an adverse outcome (or the adverse publicity from the claims)\nin any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax\nreturns and reports by federal, state, and local tax authorities, and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take.\n22\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims. Actual results may\ndiffer and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes. In addition, applicable\naccounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and those changes could have material effects on our\nreported operating results and financial condition.\nDamage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nOur reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity. Any incident that erodes the\ntrust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business, particularly if the\nincident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Such an incident could also include alleged acts or\nomissions by or situations involving our suppliers (or their contractors or subcontractors), the landlord for our stores, or our\nassociates outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. The use of\nsocial media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications which allow\nindividuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, continues to increase. The availability of\ninformation (whether correct or erroneous) on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Many social media\nplatforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of\nthe content. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily\navailable. Information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be\nadverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could negatively affect our sales, diminish customer trust, reduce employee\nmorale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates. The harm may be immediate,\nwithout affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nOur inability to continually attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our off-price\nretail strategies along with labor shortages, increased turnover, or increased labor costs could adversely affect our\noperating results.\nLike other retailers, we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization, management,\nstores, distribution centers, and other key areas. Many of our retail store associates are in entry level or part-time positions with\nhistorically high rates of turnover. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing\nwage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or\nhealthcare benefits.\nAny increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or, if we fail to pay such higher wages, may result in increased\nturnover. Excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding, hiring, and training new associates. If we cannot\nhire enough qualified associates, or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from third-party providers,\nespecially during our peak seasons, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nBecause of the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must also attract, train, and retain our key associates across the\nCompany, especially within our buying organization. The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or the inability to effectively\nidentify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is no assurance that we\nwill be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse\neffect on our growth, operations, or financial position.\nWe must effectively advertise and market our business.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities, the name recognition\nand reputation of our brands, and the location of our stores. Although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract\ncustomers to our stores, particularly through television and social media, our competitors may spend more or use different\napproaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our advertising and other promotional programs may not\nbe effective or may be perceived negatively, or could require increased expenditures, any of which could adversely affect sales\nor increase costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries.\nRisks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas, compliance with anti-dumping regulations,\neconomic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation, recession, and exchange rate fluctuations), foreign\ngovernment regulations, employment and labor matters, concerns relating to human rights, working conditions, and other issues\nin factories or countries where merchandise is produced, transparency of sourcing and supply chains, exposure on product\nwarranty and intellectual property issues, consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise, wars and fears of war,\npolitical unrest, natural disasters, regulations to address climate change, and trade restrictions.\n23\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell (even when we purchase it domestically, often as excess inventory\nsold to us by a domestic vendor) is originally manufactured in other countries. In addition, we directly source a portion of the\nproducts sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in Asia (including China). We also buy products that originate\nfrom foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives. Although our foreign purchases of\nmerchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies\ncould increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors. When we are the importer of record, we may be subject\nto regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer.\nTo the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products, any event\ncausing a disruption, delay, or increase in the cost of imports, including the imposition of import or other restrictions, war, acts of\nterrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics) could\nadversely affect our business. The flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by global shipping\ncapacity limitations, or by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are\nmanufactured. Trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, applicable to the products we sell could also affect the\nimportation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. We cannot predict\nwhether any of the countries from which our products are sourced, or in which our products are currently manufactured or may\nbe manufactured in the future, will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments or the likelihood,\ntype or effect of any such restrictions.\nWe require our vendors (for both import and domestic purchasing) to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct,\ncompliance, and other requirements, including those relating to environmental, employment and labor (including wages and\nworking conditions), health, safety, and anti-bribery standards. From time to time, our vendors, their contractors, or their\nsubcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws. Although we have\nimplemented policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign\nmarkets and importing merchandise, and to monitor the compliance of our suppliers, this does not guarantee that suppliers and\nother third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing\nnoncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could\nsubject us to claims and liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding apparel and home-related merchandise produced in other countries could\nadversely affect our business.\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries. The U.S. government\nhas at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies, including those with China. This exposes us to\nrisks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise, and creates increased\nuncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships,\nor tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost\nof goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we\nmay fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes.\nIn addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business\ndecisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business\nopportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to\nthose changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our\nprofitability.\nWe may experience volatility in revenues and earnings.\nOur business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and back-to-school seasons, weather, and other factors. Although\nour off-price business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, we may still experience unexpected\ndecreases in sales from time to time, which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins. Significant operating\nexpenses, such as rent expense and associate salaries, do not adjust proportionately with our sales. If sales in a certain period\nare lower than our plans, we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently, which could adversely affect our\noperating results.\nA pandemic, natural or man-made disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores,\noffices, or a distribution center could harm our business.\nOur corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office, nine distribution centers/warehouses, and approximately 23% of our\nstores are located in California. Natural or other disasters, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics),\nwildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or other extreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions, and\nacts of war or terrorism, or public health issues, in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain, or could\nshut down, damage, or destroy our stores or distribution facilities.\n24\nTo support our continuing operations, our new store and distribution center growth plans, our quarterly dividends, and\nany resumption of our stock repurchase program, we must maintain sufficient liquidity; the COVID-19 pandemic and\nrelated economic disruption are adding significant uncertainty and challenges.\nWe depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities, and to supply capital\nto finance our operations, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels, and return value to our\nstockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a prolonged period during the first\nhalf of 2020 in which we temporarily closed all store locations and distribution centers. Although our store and distribution center\noperations have remained substantially open since June of 2020, there have been ongoing regional restrictions on store\noperating capacity, ongoing adversity in general economic conditions, and adverse impact on consumer confidence and\nshopping behavior. While the pandemic continues, further closures or disruptions to our operations may be required nationally,\nregionally, or in specific locations. The situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities, our growth plans and our financial\nperformance would be adversely affected.\nWe have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities. In March 2020, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving\ncredit facility (subsequently repaid in the third quarter of 2020). In April 2020, we completed a $2.0 billion senior notes offering\n(subsequently we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of those senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in\naggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes). These actions were taken to add to our cash balances in order to\nprovide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If\nour access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely\nimpacted. In addition, if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, our operations, cash flows, and returns to\nstockholders could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to impacts from instances of damage to our stores and losses of merchandise accompanying protests\nor demonstrations, which may result in temporary store closures.\nThere have been recent demonstrations and protests in cities throughout the United States. While they have generally been\npeaceful, in some locations they have been accompanied by violence, damage to retail stores, and the loss of merchandise.\nWhile generally subject to coverage by insurance, the repair of damage to our stores and replacement of lost merchandise may\nalso increase our costs and temporarily disrupt store operations, and we may incur increased operating costs for additional\nsecurity. Governmental authorities in affected cities and regions may take actions in an effort to protect people and property while\npermitting lawful and non-violent protests, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, which may be disruptive to\nour operations. These activities, governmental responses, and resulting media coverage may also harm consumer confidence\nand perceptions of personal well-being and security, which may negatively affect shopping behavior and our sales.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAt January 30, 2021, we operated a total of 1,859 stores, of which 1,585 were Ross stores in 40 states, the District of Columbia,\nand Guam, and 274 were dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states. All stores are leased, with the exception of two locations which\nwe own.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we opened 50 new Ross stores and closed 11 existing stores. The average approximate Ross store size is\n28,000 square feet.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we opened 16 new dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, including reopening one store previously temporarily closed\ndue to a weather event, and closed one existing store. The average approximate dd’s DISCOUNTS store size is 23,000 square\nfeet.\nDuring fiscal 2020, no one store accounted for more than 1% of our sales.\nWe carry fire, flood, wind, and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such events.\nOur real estate strategy in 2021 is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate, to increase our market\npenetration and leverage overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market. We also expect to\ncontinue our store expansion in newer markets in 2021. Important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both\n25\nnewer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition,\nand population density of the local trade area. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions.\nThe following table summarizes the locations of our stores by state/territory as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.\nState/Territory January 30, 2021 February 1, 2020\nAlabama 24 24\nArizona 81 82\nArkansas 10 9\nCalifornia 431 417\nColorado 38 38\nDelaware 4 3\nDistrict of Columbia 2 2\nFlorida 225 221\nGeorgia 63 64\nGuam 2 2\nHawaii 22 22\nIdaho 12 12\nIllinois 89 83\nIndiana 26 20\nIowa 6 6\nKansas 12 12\nKentucky 15 15\nLouisiana 20 19\nMaryland 26 26\nMississippi 9 9\nMissouri 27 27\nMontana 6 6\nNebraska 5 5\nNevada 40 39\nNew Jersey 18 14\nNew Mexico 18 18\nNorth Carolina 49 48\nNorth Dakota 3 3\nOhio 8 5\nOklahoma 28 27\nOregon 30 31\nPennsylvania 51 50\nSouth Carolina 30 27\nSouth Dakota 2 2\nTennessee 37 36\nTexas 260 255\nUtah 23 22\nVirginia 41 40\nWashington 43 42\nWest Virginia 1 —\nWisconsin 19 19\nWyoming 3 3\nTotal 1,859 1,805\nWhere possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a\nrelatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market. At January 30, 2021, the majority of our stores had\nunexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years, with three to four renewal options of five years each.

Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of January 30, 2021.\nWe are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed\nagainst us may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and\nemployment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal,\nstate, and/or local laws. Actions against us are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal\nissues and are subject to uncertainties.\nLike many retailers and other businesses, we have filed a lawsuit as plaintiff against the insurance companies with respect to our\nclaims for insurance coverage for business interruption, property damage, and other losses that we have experienced as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Our suit was filed in Alameda County, California in December 2020. The proceedings remain at an\nearly procedural stage, and are subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe believe that the resolution of our pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and\nregulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOverview\nRoss Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores—Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) and\ndd’s DISCOUNTS®. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1,585 locations in 40\nstates, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of January 30, 2021. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer\napparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty\nstore regular prices every day. We also operate 274 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states as of January 30, 2021 that feature a\nmore moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for\nthe entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.\nOur primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and\nfinancial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, and considering the pace and\nmagnitude of the economic recovery post the COVID-19 pandemic, we are closely monitoring market share trends for the off-\nprice industry and believe our share gains will continue to be driven mainly by continued focus on value and convenience by\nconsumers. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the\noff-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling\ndiscounts every day.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019 as fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and\nfiscal 2018, respectively.\nEffects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing an ongoing, major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a\nnovel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, that started at the beginning of 2020. Governmental authorities in affected regions have\ntaken, and continue to take, dramatic actions in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. Like other retailers across the\ncountry, we temporarily closed all our store locations, our distribution centers, and our buying and corporate offices for a\nsignificant part of our first and second fiscal quarters. We also instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates.\nOur closures took effect March 20, 2020.\nAll our distribution centers were reopened by the end of May 2020. The vast majority of our store locations were open and\noperating by the end of June 2020, and remained open throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020. While open, many of our stores\nwere operating on shorter hours and under mandated occupancy restrictions for periods of time as compared to the prior year.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption had a material adverse impact on our results of operations,\nfinancial position, and cash flows for fiscal 2020. The consolidated results presented in this report reflect the significant revenue\ndecline and other impacts from our temporary store closures (for approximately half of the first quarter and 25 percent of the\nsecond quarter), mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced operating hours. Our core business results improved during the\nsecond half of fiscal 2020; however, upsurges of COVID-19 in the fourth quarter, especially in California, our largest state,\nresulted in reduced customer traffic and slowed the pace of recovery. While vaccines have become available and a steadily\nincreasing portion of the U.S. population is being vaccinated, it will take time for those efforts to reach levels that permit a\nrelaxation of the social distancing restrictions. We expect the material adverse effects from the pandemic to continue through\nfiscal 2021 and potentially beyond.\nThe temporary closure of all our stores during much of the first two fiscal quarters significantly impacted our ability to sell the\nseasonal inventory then on hand in a timely manner. As we reopened our stores and resumed operations in the middle of the\nsecond quarter, a significant portion of the merchandise in our stores was aged and out of season. We took deep markdowns to\nsell through this inventory. During the initial reopenings, sales were ahead of our conservative plans, as we benefited from pent-\nup consumer demand and aggressive markdowns. In the weeks after reopening, sales trends were negatively affected by\ndepleted store inventory levels while we were ramping up our buying and distribution capabilities. During the third quarter, sales\nimproved substantially compared to the second quarter. This was driven by several factors, including an improvement in our\nmerchandise assortments, a later back-to-school season, stronger performance in our larger markets, and our return to more\nnormal store hours. Our fourth quarter sales remained suppressed due to the negative impact from the upsurge in the virus that\nresulted in reduced customer traffic and more stringent occupancy and store operating hours restrictions.\n34\nThe ongoing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and spending patterns remains highly uncertain. Despite\nthe initial surge in customer demand as our stores first reopened, we expect customer demand to be generally suppressed for an\nextended period of time. In addition, there have been recent resurgences in the spread of COVID-19 and new virus variants\nthroughout the United States, which may also recur in the future, in one or more regions, and which have and could require our\nstores and distribution centers to temporarily close again nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. These closures would\nnegatively impact our future revenue and operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we incurred various costs to reopen our stores and distribution centers, and we incurred\nadditional operating costs for processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing, to enhance cleaning and sanitation\nactivities, and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates. These actions, combined with various other actions\ntaken to reduce costs, resulted in approximately $130 million of additional net costs in fiscal 2020. We expect our operating costs\nto remain elevated related to our continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility\nin March 2020, completed a $2.0 billion senior notes offering in April 2020, and entered into a new $500 million 364-day senior\nrevolving credit facility in May 2020. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount\nof higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes.\nThis action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our\nannual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt. In addition to refinancing the senior notes, we took\nseveral other actions during the third quarter, to reduce our ongoing debt costs, including repayment of the $800 million revolving\ncredit facility and termination of the undrawn $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility.\nWe suspended our stock repurchase program in March 2020 and temporarily suspended quarterly dividends in May 2020, and\nwe took measures to reduce our expenses, inventory receipts, and capital expenditures. Beginning April 5, 2020, we\nimplemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of our hourly store and distribution center and other associates in our buying\nand corporate offices who could not work productively while our stores and distribution centers were closed. Employee health\nbenefits for eligible associates continued during the temporary furlough at no cost to the impacted associates. We also reduced\npayroll expenses through temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other personnel, which remained in effect until\nMay 24, 2020, when more than half of our stores had reopened. In conjunction with these payroll expense reduction measures,\neffective April 1, 2020, the non-employee members of our Board of Directors suspended the cash elements of their director\ncompensation, which remained in effect until August 2020.\nIn May 2020, in connection with the phased reopening of our store and distribution center locations, we began recalling many of\nour furloughed associates, as they were able to resume productive work. As of our third quarter, the majority of these associates\nhad returned to work.\nAlso in May 2020, we suspended rent payments associated with the leases for our temporarily closed stores. During fiscal 2020,\nwe negotiated rent deferrals and/or rent abatements for a significant number of our stores. The repayment of the deferrals will be\nat later dates, primarily in fiscal 2021. We have recorded accruals for rent payment deferrals and have recorded rent abatements\nas a reduction of variable lease costs.\nGiven the unprecedented impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, and the continued uncertainty surrounding\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its unknown duration and future severity, the potential for resurgences and new virus\nvariants, and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand and store productivity, we expect that impacts from the COVID-\n19 pandemic and the related cost increases and economic disruption may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated\nresults of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in fiscal 2021 and potentially beyond.\n35\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n2020 2019 2018\nSales\nSales (millions) $ 12,532 $ 16,039 $ 14,984\nSales (decline) growth (21.9)% 7.0% 6.0%\nComparable store sales growth n/a1 3%2 4%2\nCosts and expenses (as a percent of sales)\nCost of goods sold 78.5% 71.9% 71.6%\nSelling, general and administrative 20.0% 14.7% 14.8%\nInterest expense (income), net 0.7% (0.1)% (0.1)%\nEarnings before taxes (as a percent of sales) 0.8% 13.5% 13.7%\nNet earnings (as a percent of sales) 0.7% 10.4% 10.6%\n1 Given the temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable store sales metric for fiscal 2020\nis not meaningful.\n2 Represents stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months.\nStores.

The number of\nstores at the end of fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 increased by 3%, 5%, and 6% from the respective prior years. In response to\nthe impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our pace of new store openings for fiscal 2020. Our longer term strategy\nis to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store\nprofitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and\nopportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based\non similar criteria.\nStore Count 2020 2019 2018\nBeginning of the period 1,805 1,717 1,622\nOpened in the period 66 1 98 99\nClosed in the period (12) (10)2 (4)\nEnd of the period 1,859 1,805 1,717\nSelling square footage at the end of the period (000) 38,800 37,900 36,300\n1 Includes the reopening of a store previously temporarily closed due to a weather event.\n2 Includes the temporary closure of a store impacted by a weather event.\nSales. Sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $3.5 billion, or 21.9%, compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the negative\nimpact from store closures during the March 2020 to June 2020 period, the negative impact on customer demand from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced store operating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020.\nWe opened 54 net new stores during 2020. The sales from these new stores partially offset the overall sales decline.\nSales for fiscal 2019 increased $1.1 billion, or 7.0%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 88 net new stores during\n2019 and a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores.\n36\nOur sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n2020 2019 2018\nHome Accents and Bed and Bath 28% 25% 26%\nLadies 23% 26% 26%\nMen’s 14% 14% 14%\nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Fragrances 14% 13% 13%\nShoes 12% 13% 13%\nChildren’s 9% 9% 8%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nWe intend to address the competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing\nstrategies and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization, diversify our merchandise mix, and more fully develop our\nsystems to improve our merchandise offerings.\nOur historic strategies and store expansion program have contributed to our sales gains in the past. However, given the impacts\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic on our results for fiscal 2020, and the significant ongoing impacts and uncertainties, including the\nunknown overall impact on consumer demand and shopping behavior, the unknown duration of the pandemic, and potential\nresponses to it (which may require stores and distribution centers to close again nationally, regionally, or in specific locations), we\ncannot be sure that our strategies and resumption of our store expansion program will result in a continuation of our historical\nsales growth or in a recovery of, or an increase in, net earnings.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased $1.7 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the lower\nsales from the temporary closure of all store locations (starting on March 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter of\nfiscal 2020), and ensuing negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic after our store reopenings, as well\nas lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some associates in our\nbuying offices. These decreases were partially offset by higher markdowns used to clear aged and seasonal inventory, higher\ndistribution costs primarily due to increased wages and higher freight costs due to industry-wide supply chain congestion, added\nexpenditures for COVID-19 related measures, and higher occupancy costs from the opening of 54 net new stores during 2020.\nAs we enter 2021, we expect higher supply chain costs from the industry-wide congestion to continue through fiscal 2021, along\nwith higher costs from increases in wages we implemented in the second half of 2020.\nCost of goods sold in fiscal 2019 increased $809.9 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased sales from the\nopening of 88 net new stores during the year and a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores.\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 increased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year, primarily\ndue to a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. These increases were\npartially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a five basis point reduction in buying costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)\nincreased $146.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to approximately $240 million in long-term debt refinancing\ncosts, COVID-related expenses (including for supplies, cleaning, and payroll related to additional safety protocols), and\npayments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)), partially offset by payroll-related cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-\n19 pandemic (including the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our stores during closure periods, and some\nassociates in our corporate offices), reductions in non-business critical operating expenses, and lower store operating expenses\non lower sales. As we enter 2021, we expect our operating costs to continue to reflect ongoing COVID-related expenses and\nalso higher wages.\nFor fiscal 2019, SG&A increased $140.2 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs\nreflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by\napproximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales.\n37\nInterest expense (income), net. In fiscal 2020, net interest expense increased by $101.5 million compared to 2019 primarily\ndue to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to the issuance of Senior Notes in April 2020 and October 2020 (net of\nrepurchase of Senior Notes), lower interest income due to lower interest rates, and higher interest expense on short-term debt\ndue to the draw down on our $800 million revolving credit facility in March 2020 (which was subsequently repaid in October\n2020), partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution\ncenter.\nIn fiscal 2019, net interest income improved by $7.9 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest expense on long-\nterm debt due to the repayment of the Series A 6.38% unsecured Senior Notes in December 2018 and higher capitalized interest\nprimarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center.\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n($000) 2020 2019 2018\nInterest expense on long-term debt $ 88,544 $ 13,139 $ 17,900\nInterest expense on short-term debt 7,863 — —\nOther interest expense 3,908 968 1,004\nCapitalized interest (12,251) (4,367) (2,497)\nInterest income (4,651) (27,846) (26,569)\nInterest expense (income), net $ 83,413 $ (18,106) $ (10,162)\nTaxes on earnings. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately 20%, 23%, and 23%,\nrespectively. The effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal\nbenefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting\nguidance, location of new stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with share-based compensation, and the resolution of\ntax positions with various tax authorities.\nIn fiscal 2019, we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of\napproximately $10.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2018, we resolved uncertain tax positions\nrelated to fiscal 2015 with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $26.0 million in\nthe Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act made several significant changes to business tax\nprovisions including modifications for net operating losses, employee retention credits, and deferral of employer payroll tax\npayments. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA made\nseveral changes to business tax provisions including increasing and extending the employee retention credits through June 30,\n2021 and extending certain employment-related tax credits through December 31, 2025.\nNet earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower than in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher cost\nof goods sold, higher SG&A expenses, and higher interest expense. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were\nlower compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and higher\ninterest income.\nEarnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was $0.24, compared to $4.60 in the prior year. The lower diluted\nearnings per share in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations starting on\nMarch 20, 2020 through a portion the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the negative impact on customer demand from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory, long-term debt refinancing costs, payments to\nassociates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the CARES Act), and higher expenditures for\nCOVID-19 related measures.\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was $4.60, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.02 primarily related\nto the favorable resolution of a tax matter, compared to $4.26 in the prior year, which included a per share benefit of\napproximately $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.\n38\nFinancial Condition\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs previously noted, the United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the\noutbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19 that started at the beginning of 2020. Governmental authorities in affected\nregions have taken, and continue to take, dramatic actions in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. Similar to other\nretailers across the country, we temporarily closed all store locations, our distribution centers, and our buying and corporate\noffices, effective March 20, 2020 through May 14, 2020, when we began a phased process of resuming operations. All our\ndistribution centers were reopened by the end of May 2020. The vast majority of our store locations were open and operating by\nthe end of June 2020, and remained open throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020, though many of our stores were operating on\nshorter hours and under mandated occupancy restrictions for periods of time, compared to the prior year.\nTo preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility\nin March 2020, completed a $2.0 billion senior notes offering in April 2020, and entered into a new $500 million 364-day senior\nrevolving credit facility in May 2020. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount\nof higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes.\nThis action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our\nannual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt. In addition to refinancing the senior notes refinancing, we\ntook several other actions during the third quarter, to reduce our ongoing debt costs, including repayment of the $800 million\nrevolving credit facility and termination of the undrawn $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility.\nWe suspended our stock repurchase program in March 2020 and temporarily suspended quarterly dividends in May 2020, and\nwe took measures to reduce our expenses, inventory receipts, and capital expenditures. Beginning April 5, 2020, we\nimplemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of our hourly store and distribution center and other associates in our buying\nand corporate offices who could not work productively while our stores and distribution centers were closed. Employee health\nbenefits for eligible associates continued during the temporary furlough at no cost to the impacted associates. We also reduced\npayroll expenses through temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other personnel, which remained in effect until\nMay 24, 2020, when more than half of our stores had reopened. In conjunction with these payroll expense reduction measures,\neffective April 1, 2020, the non-employee members of our Board of Directors suspended the cash elements of their director\ncompensation, which remained in effect until August 2020.\nAlso in May 2020, we suspended rent payments associated with the leases for our temporarily closed stores. During fiscal 2020,\nwe negotiated rent deferrals and/or rent abatements for a significant number of our stores. The repayment of the deferrals will be\nat later dates, primarily in fiscal 2021. We recorded accruals for rent payment deferrals and recorded rent abatements as a\nreduction of variable lease costs.\nWe ended fiscal 2020 with over $5.6 billion in liquidity, which consists of $4.8 billion unrestricted cash balances and the $800\nmillion available under our revolving credit facility.\nHistorically, our primary sources of funds for our business activities have been cash flows from operations and short-term trade\ncredit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease\ncosts, taxes, and for capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers,\ninformation systems, and buying and corporate offices. We also use cash to pay dividends, to repay debt as it becomes due, and\nto repurchase stock under active stock repurchase programs.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, and with the possibility that some of our stores, distribution\ncenters, and other facilities may need to temporarily close again, or continue on reduced operating hours and/or capacity\nrestrictions, as a result of government mandates, we anticipate potential interruptions to our cash flows from operations. We\nanticipate that we will be required to rely more on our cash reserves and we expect to carefully monitor and manage our cash\nposition in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations.\n($ millions) 2020 2019 2018\nCash provided by operating activities $ 2,245.9 $ 2,171.5 $ 2,066.7\nCash used in investing activities (405.4) (555.0) (410.4)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,701.9 (1,683.2) (1,531.5)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and\ncash equivalents $ 3,542.4 $ (66.7) $ 124.8\n39\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2020. This was primarily driven by higher accounts payable\ndue to extended payment terms, lower merchandise receipts as we closely managed inventory levels and used packaway\ninventory to replenish our stores, and net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. This was\npartially offset by the lower net earnings due to lower sales from the temporary closing of all store locations starting on March 20,\n2020 through a portion of the second quarter, and the negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net\ncash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was primarily\ndriven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes.\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher accounts\npayable leverage. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven\nby higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year. Accounts payable\nleverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) was 150%, 71%, and 67% as of January 30, 2021,\nFebruary 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, respectively. The increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to\nfiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and in-store inventory and extended payment terms. The increase in\naccounts payable leverage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by timing of merchandise receipts and\nrelated payments versus the prior year.\nAs a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise\npurchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory. Packaway merchandise\nis purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway\ninventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store\nmerchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase,\nbut in normal times and historically, packaway remains in storage less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage\nof packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2020, packaway inventory was 38% of\ntotal inventory compared to 46% at the end of both fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $405.4 million, $555.0 million, and $410.4 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nrespectively. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a\nreduction in our capital expenditures. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018\nwas primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures.\nThe decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our actions to preserve our\nfinancial liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. The increase in capital expenditures\nin fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers, and information technology\ninfrastructure investments for our stores, buying, corporate offices, and transportation. We opened 66, 98, and 99 new stores in\nfiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, our capital expenditures were $405.4 million, $555.5 million, and $413.9 million, respectively. Our\ncapital expenditures included costs to build, expand, and improve distribution centers (primarily related to the ongoing\nconstruction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center); open new stores and improve existing stores; and for various other\nexpenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:\n($ millions) 2020 2019 2018\nNew stores $ 81.1 $ 137.4 $ 134.5\nExisting stores 54.8 125.3 130.5\nInformation systems, corporate, and other 38.3 91.8 84.9\nDistribution and transportation 231.2 201.0 64.0\nTotal capital expenditures $ 405.4 $ 555.5 $ 413.9\n40\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are projected to be approximately $700 million. Our planned capital expenditures for fiscal\n2021 are expected to be used for continued construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center, costs for fixtures and\nleasehold improvements to open planned new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, investments in certain information technology\nsystems, and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying, and corporate offices. We\nexpect to fund capital expenditures with available cash. The increase in our planned capital expenditures from fiscal 2020 are\nprimarily driven by the continued construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center and the resumption of certain projects\nthat were deferred from fiscal 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion and\n$1.5 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020, compared\nto fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings, net of repurchase and refinancing costs, and the\nsuspension of our share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a new $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous $600 million\nunsecured revolving credit facility. This current credit facility expires in July 2024, and contains a $300 million sublimit for\nissuance of standby letters of credit. The facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit\nfacility by up to an additional $300 million, with the agreement of the lenders. Interest on borrowings under this facility is based\non LIBOR (or an alternate benchmark rate, if LIBOR is no longer available) plus an applicable margin and is payable quarterly\nand upon maturity. The revolving credit facility may be extended, at our option, for up to two additional one-year periods, subject\nto customary conditions.\nIn March 2020, we borrowed $800 million under our revolving credit facility. Interest on the loan was based on LIBOR plus\n0.875% (or 1.76%).\nIn May 2020, we amended the $800 million revolving credit facility (the “Amended Credit Facility”) to temporarily suspend for the\nsecond and third quarters of fiscal 2020 the Consolidated Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR ratio financial covenant, and to apply a\ntransitional modification to that ratio effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Amended Credit Facility also established a\nnew temporary minimum liquidity requirement effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and through the end of April 2021. As of\nJanuary 30, 2021, we were in compliance with these amended covenants.\nIn October 2020, we repaid in full the $800 million we borrowed under the unsecured revolving credit facility. As a result, we\ncurrently have no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility, and the $800 million credit facility remains\nin place and available.\nIn May 2020, we also entered into an additional $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility which was scheduled to\nexpire in April 2021. In October 2020, we terminated this senior revolving credit facility. We had no borrowings under that credit\nfacility at any time.\nIn April 2020, we issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in four tenors as follows: $700 million of 4.600%\nSenior Notes due April 2025, $400 million of 4.700% Senior Notes due April 2027, $400 million of 4.800% Senior Notes due April\n2030, and $500 million of 5.450% Senior Notes due April 2050.\nIn October 2020, we accepted for purchase approximately $775 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to\ncash tender offers as follows: $351 million of the 2050 Notes, $266 million of the 2030 Notes, and $158 million of the 2027\nNotes. We paid approximately $1.003 billion in aggregate consideration (including transaction costs, and accrued and unpaid\ninterest) and recorded an approximately $240 million loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes.\nIn October 2020, we also issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in two tenors as follows: 0.875% Senior\nNotes due April 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 1.875% Senior Notes due April\n2031 (the “2031 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Cash proceeds, net of discounts and other issuance\ncosts, were approximately $987.2 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 and 2031 Notes to fund the\npurchase of the accepted notes from our tender offers.\nIn June 2020, we amended the covenants associated with the $65 million outstanding Series B unsecured senior notes. The\namended covenants are consistent with the corresponding covenants in our existing revolving credit facility. As of January 30,\n2021, we were in compliance with these covenants.\n41\nOn December 13, 2018, we repaid at maturity the $85 million principal amount of the Series A 6.38% unsecured Senior Notes.\nIn March 2019, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $2.55 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020. Due to\nthe economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended our stock repurchase\nprogram in March 2020, at which time we had repurchased $1.407 billion under the $2.55 billion stock repurchase program. We\ndo not plan on making additional purchases until further notice.\nIn February 2017, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018. In\nMarch 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by $200 million to\n$1.075 billion, up from the previously available $875 million.\nWe repurchased 1.2 million, 12.3 million, and 12.5 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of\napproximately $132 million, $1,275 million, and $1,075 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also acquired 0.5\nmillion, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million shares in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, of treasury stock from our employee stock\nequity compensation programs, for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $45.2 million, $60.7 million, and $54.4 million\nduring fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOn March 2, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per common share, payable on\nMarch 31, 2021, resuming our payment of quarterly dividends. Our most recent prior quarterly dividend was a cash dividend of\n$0.285 per common share declared by our Board of Directors in March 2020. In May 2020, we temporarily suspended our\nquarterly dividends, due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Board of Directors declared\ncash dividends of $0.255 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2019, and cash dividends of $0.225 per\ncommon share in March, May, August, and November 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we paid dividends of $101.4 million, $369.8 million, and $337.2 million, respectively.\nShort-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from\ncustomary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from\nall sources. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, we face added uncertainty about the levels of\ntrade credit we can maintain and liquidity available from sales of merchandise.\nDuring fiscal 2020, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations, and\nour long-term debt financing. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash\nand cash flows from operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, including the temporary closure of all of our store locations effective\nMarch 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter, continue to create significant uncertainty and challenges. We believe\nthat existing cash balances, our bank credit facility, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing\nneeds for at least the next 12 months.\n42\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of January 30, 2021:\nLess than 1 - 3 3 - 5 After 5\n($000) 1 year years years years Total¹\nRecorded contractual obligations:\nSenior notes $ 65,000 $ — $ 950,000 $ 1,524,991 $ 2,539,991\nOperating leases 628,613 1,220,165 813,939 611,178 3,273,895\nNew York buying office ground lease² 5,883 13,898 14,178 940,438 974,397\nUnrecorded contractual obligations:\nReal estate obligations3 6,420 32,937 35,388 113,992 188,737\nInterest payment obligations 84,369 160,631 136,094 299,041 680,135\nPurchase obligations4 3,048,513 13,540 1,593 — 3,063,646\nTotal contractual obligations $ 3,838,798 $ 1,441,171 $ 1,951,192 $ 3,489,640 $ 10,720,801\n1 We have a $65.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in Other long-term liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be\nreasonably estimated.\n² Our New York buying office building is subject to a 99-year ground lease.\n3 Minimum lease payments for operating leases signed that have not yet commenced.\n4 Purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction\nprojects, store fixtures and supplies, and information technology services, transportation, and maintenance contracts.\nOther than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as\nof January 30, 2021.\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. We use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition\nto a funded trust to collateralize some of our insurance obligations. We also use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving\ncredit facility to collateralize some of our trade payable obligations. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we had $15.3\nmillion and $4.2 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding, and $56.1 million and $56.0 million, respectively, in\na collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted\ncash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nTrade letters of credit. We had $16.3 million and $11.2 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 30, 2021 and\nFebruary 1, 2020, respectively.\nEffects of inflation or deflation. We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position\nand results of operations.\nOther\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical\nexperience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting\npolicies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements\nand are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (“GAAP”), with no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management’s\njudgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our\naudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contain\ndescriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP.\n43\nMerchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis)\nor net realizable value. We purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with\nthe intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our\nstores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Company’s store\nmerchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase,\nbut typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 38%, 46%,\nand 46% of total inventories as of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, respectively. Merchandise\ninventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory.\nIncluded in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on\nhistorical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual\nmarket conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise\ninventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.\nLease accounting. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate; we use the estimated collateralized\nincremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of\nlease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This rate is determined using a\nportfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating,\ncredit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. We believe that this is the rate we would have to pay to borrow an\namount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. Operating lease liabilities and\ncorresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We do\nnot record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and account for lease\nand non-lease components as a single lease component. Our lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost\nrecorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nPrior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019, when a lease contained\n“rent holidays” or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we recorded rental expense on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and the amount\npayable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent. We began recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant\nimprovement allowances were amortized over the lease term. Changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances\nwere included as a component of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nInsurance obligations. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities,\nincluding workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible\nliability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater\namount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our\nrecorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Recently issued accounting\nstandards and Recently adopted accounting standards) for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2020, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press\nreleases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking\nstatements regarding, without limitation, the rapidly developing challenges and our plans and responses to the COVID-19\npandemic and related economic disruptions, including adjustments to our operations, planned new store growth, new markets,\nexpected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. These forward-looking statements reflect our\nthen current beliefs, plans, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and\ncompetitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “target,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,”\n“looking ahead,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\n44\nFuture impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other economic and industry trends that could potentially impact\nrevenue, profitability, operating conditions, and growth remain difficult to predict. Our forward-looking statements are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our\nprevious expectations, plans, and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete\ndiscussion of risk factors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to\nchange. As a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily\nreflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for\ntrading or speculative purposes.\nWe occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward\ncontracts as of January 30, 2021.\nInterest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in\nmarket interest rates. As of January 30, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of January 30, 2021, we have outstanding eight series of unsecured Senior Notes. Interest that is payable on all series of our\nSenior Notes is based on fixed interest rates, and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates.\nWe receive interest on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in\nthe future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material negative impact\non our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments\nas of and for the year ended January 30, 2021. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from\nreasonably possible, near-term changes in interest rates to be material.\n45\nITEM 8.

accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n49\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness. Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand\nand designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company\noperated 1,585 Ross Dress for Less® (“Ross”) locations in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 274 dd’s\nDISCOUNTS® stores in 21 states. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores are supported by the Company’s headquarters,\nbuying offices, and its network of distribution centers/warehouses.\nSegment reporting. The Company has one reportable segment. The Company’s operations include only activities related to off-\nprice retailing in stores throughout the United States.\nBasis of presentation and fiscal year. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company\nfollows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the\nSaturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 are referred\nto as fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018, respectively, and were 52-week years.\nUse of accounting estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The\nCompany’s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory, packaway inventory costs, useful lives of\nfixed assets, insurance reserves, reserves for uncertain tax positions, employee retention credits under the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), and legal claims. Given the global economic climate and additional, or\nunforeseen effects, from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates are more challenging, and actual results could differ\nmaterially from the Company’s estimates.\nPurchase obligations. As of January 30, 2021, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately $3.1 billion. These\npurchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects,\nstore fixtures and supplies, and information technology services, transportation, and maintenance contracts.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original\nmaturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments serve as collateral\nfor certain insurance and trade payable obligations of the Company. These restricted funds are invested in bank deposits, money\nmarket mutual funds, U.S. Government and agency securities, and corporate securities and cannot be withdrawn from the\nCompany’s account without the prior written consent of the secured parties. The classification between current and long-term is\nbased on the timing of expected payments of the obligations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets that reconcile to the amounts shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n($000) 2020 2019 2018\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,819,293 $ 1,351,205 $ 1,412,912\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents included in:\nPrepaid expenses and other 85,711 10,235 11,402\nOther long-term assets 48,765 49,970 53,765\nTotal restricted cash and cash equivalents 134,476 60,205 65,167\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 4,953,769 $ 1,411,410 $ 1,478,079\nIn addition to the restricted cash and cash equivalents in the table above, the Company had restricted investments of $0.4 million\nas of February 2, 2019 included in Prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had no\nrestricted investments as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.\n50\nEstimated fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term\ninvestments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts\npayable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. See Note B and Note D for additional fair value\ninformation.\nCash and cash equivalents were $4,819.3 million and $1,351.2 million, at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively,\nand include bank deposits and money market funds for which the fair value was determined using quoted prices for identical\nassets in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures\nguidance.\nInvestments. The Company’s investments are comprised of various debt securities. At January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020,\nthese investments were classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Investments are classified as either short- or\nlong-term based on their maturity dates and the Company’s intent. Investments with a maturity of less than one year are\nclassified as short-term. See Note B for additional information.\nMerchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or\nnet realizable value. The Company purchases inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway\nmerchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of\npackaway inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to\nthe Company’s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and\nseasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Merchandise inventory includes\nacquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is\nreduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company’s physical merchandise\ninventory counts and cycle counts.\nCost of goods sold. In addition to product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution, and freight\nexpenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying, and\ndistribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost\nof operating the Company’s distribution centers, warehouses, and cross-dock facilities.\nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three to\n12 years for equipment, 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, and three to seven years for computer software\ncosts incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the\nuseful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and\nequipment was $364.2 million, $350.9 million, and $330.4 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company\ncapitalizes interest during the construction period of facilities and during the development and implementation phase of software\nprojects. Interest capitalized was $12.3 million, $4.4 million, and $2.5 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of\nJanuary 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019 the Company had $56.2 million, $40.3 million, and $33.7 million,\nrespectively, of property and equipment purchased but not yet paid. These purchases are included in Property and Equipment\nand in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term assets. Other long-term assets as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2020 2019\nDeferred compensation (Note B) $ 159,116 $ 141,443\nRestricted cash and investments 48,765 49,970\nOther 22,180 16,908\nTotal $ 230,061 $ 208,321\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Property and other long-term assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. For stores that are closed, the Company records an impairment\ncharge, if appropriate, or accelerates depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Intangible assets that are not subject\nto amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company’s evaluation during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, no impairment\ncharges were recorded.\n51\nAccounts payable. Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable\nincludes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash\nbalances in such accounts of approximately $63.5 million and $138.8 million at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020,\nrespectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.\nInsurance obligations. The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management\nactivities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and\ndeductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-\ninsurance and deductible reserves as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2020 2019\nWorkers’ compensation $ 83,900 $ 87,063\nGeneral liability 42,575 44,371\nMedical plans 7,727 6,430\nTotal $ 134,202 $ 137,864\nWorkers’ compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in Accrued payroll and benefits, and accruals for\ngeneral liability are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2020 2019\nIncome taxes (Note F) $ 65,507 $ 65,956\nDeferred compensation (Note G) 159,116 141,443\nDeferred social security taxes 36,701 —\nOther 7,234 6,687\nTotal $ 268,558 $ 214,086\nLease accounting. As the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the\nestimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in\ndetermining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use\nassets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and\nassumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is\nthe rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease\nterm. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably\ncertain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with\nterms of 12 months or less, and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company’s\nlease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) provided relief under Accounting\nStandards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Accounting Standards Codification “ASC” 842). Under this relief, companies can\nmake a policy election on how to treat lease concessions resulting directly from the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the\nmodified contracts result in total cash flows that are substantially the same or less than the cash flows in the original contract.\nThe Company made the policy election to account for lease concessions that result from the COVID-19 pandemic as if they were\nmade under enforceable rights in the original contract. Additionally, the Company made the policy election to account for these\nconcessions outside of the lease modification framework described under ASC 842. The Company recorded accruals for\ndeferred rental payments and recognized rent abatements or concessions as variable lease costs in the periods incurred.\nAccruals for rent payment deferrals are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\n52\nPrior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification “ASC” 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019, when a lease contained\n“rent holidays” or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the Company recorded rental expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and\nthe amount payable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent. The Company began recording rent expense on the lease\npossession date. Tenant improvement allowances were amortized over the lease term. Changes in deferred rent and tenant\nimprovement allowances were included as a component of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRevenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of sales taxes collected and an allowance for\nestimated future returns as required by ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The Company\nrecognizes allowances for estimated sales returns on a gross basis as a reduction to sales. The asset recorded for the expected\nrecovery of merchandise inventory was $10.7 million, $10.7 million, and $10.2 million and the liability recorded for the refund due\nto the customer was $21.2 million, $20.9 million, and $19.8 million as of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2,\n2019, respectively. Sales taxes collected that are outstanding and the allowance for estimated future returns are included in\nAccrued expenses and other and the asset for expected recovery of merchandise is included in Prepaid expenses and other in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSales of stored value cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. The Company’s\nstored value cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon historical redemption rates, a small percentage of stored value\ncards will never be redeemed, which represents breakage. As a result of adopting ASC 606, breakage is estimated and\nrecognized as revenue based upon the historical pattern of customer redemptions. Breakage was not material to the\nconsolidated financial statements in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nThe following sales mix table disaggregates revenue by merchandise category for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n2020 1 2019 2018\nHome Accents and Bed and Bath 28% 25% 26%\nLadies 23% 26% 26%\nMen’s 14% 14% 14%\nAccessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Fragrances 14% 13% 13%\nShoes 12% 13% 13%\nChildren’s 9% 9% 8%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nStore pre-opening. Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses. Advertising costs for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $42.5 million, $74.0 million, and $79.9 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation. The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all\nstock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based\ncompensation plans.\nTaxes on earnings. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”\nwhich requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have\nbeen recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the\nCompany generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 clarifies the\ncriteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s\nconsolidated financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement\nstandard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. See Note F.\nTreasury stock. The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax\nwithholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\n53\nEarnings per share (“EPS”). The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by\ndividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed\nby dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan\nawards and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock. For periods of net\nloss, basic and diluted EPS are the same as the effect of the assumed vesting of restricted stock and performance share awards\nare anti-dilutive.\nIn fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 there were 79,500, 27,400, and 23,700 weighted-average shares, respectively, that were\nexcluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:\nEffect of dilutive\ncommon stock Diluted\nShares in (000s) Basic EPS equivalents EPS\n2020\nShares 352,392 2,227 354,619\nAmount $ 0.24 $ — $ 0.24\n2019\nShares 358,462 2,720 361,182\nAmount $ 4.63 $ (0.03) $ 4.60\n2018\nShares 369,533 3,145 372,678\nAmount $ 4.30 $ (0.04) $ 4.26\nComprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes net earnings and components of other comprehensive income (loss),\nnet of tax, consisting of unrealized investment gains or losses.\nRecently issued accounting standards. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards\nUpdates (“ASU”) issued by the FASB. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are\nexpected to have minimal impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results.\nRecently adopted accounting standards. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for\nIncome Taxes (ASC 740). ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions in ASC 740 related to the methodology for calculating\nincome taxes in an interim period. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The\namendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12\non a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The most significant impact to the Company is the removal of a limit on\nthe tax benefit recognized on pre-tax losses in interim periods. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on\nthe Company’s fiscal 2020 results.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which along with subsequent amendments, supersedes\nthe lease accounting requirements in ASC 840, Leases. The updated guidance requires balance sheet recognition for all leases\nwith lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to\nuse, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.\n54\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 as of February 3, 2019 (the “effective date”), using the optional transition method on a modified\nretrospective basis. The Company did not elect the transitional package of practical expedients or the use of hindsight upon\nadoption of the ASC. The Company elected to not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with\nterms of 12 months or less, and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Upon adoption,\nthe Company recorded lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments, using incremental\nborrowing rates as of the effective date, of $2.9 billion, and the corresponding right-of-use assets of $2.9 billion. The Company\nalso recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease beginning retained earnings of $19.6 million, primarily related to the\nwrite-off of previously capitalized initial direct costs that are no longer capitalized under ASC 842, partially offset by the write-off\nof the deferred gain on a previous sale-leaseback transaction that meets the sale definition under ASC 842. Reporting periods\nbeginning on or after February 3, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts and disclosures were not\nadjusted and continue to be reported under ASC 840. Adoption of ASC 842 did not have a significant impact to the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of earnings or to the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) which, along with\nsubsequent amendments, supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).” This\nguidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires entities to\nrecognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration\nthe entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASC 606 as of February 4, 2018,\nusing the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after February 4, 2018 are presented\nunder ASC 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605. Upon\nadoption of ASC 606, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings by $20\nmillion as of February 4, 2018, primarily due to the change in the timing of the recognition of stored value card breakage. The\nimpact of applying ASC 606 was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 2,\n2019.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18\nrequires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total\nbeginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The standard also requires companies who report cash and\nrestricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. The Company\nadopted ASU 2016-18 as of February 4, 2018, using the retrospective method.\nNote B: Investments and Restricted Investments\nAccounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs\nused in measuring fair value. The inputs used to measure fair value include: Level 1, observable inputs such as quoted prices in\nactive markets; Level 2, inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3, unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. This fair value hierarchy requires the Company to develop\nits own assumptions and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring\nfair value. Corporate, U.S. government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2\nbecause these securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market\nobservable inputs.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial instruments as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 are as follows:\n($000) 2020 2019\nCash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 4,819,293 $ 1,351,205\nInvestments (Level 2) $ 8 $ 8\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 134,476 $ 60,205\n55\nThe underlying assets in the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation program as of January 30, 2021 and February 1,\n2020 (included in Other long-term assets and in Other long-term liabilities) primarily consist of participant-directed money market,\nstable value, stock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement for funds with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1)\nand for funds without quoted market prices in active markets (Level 2) are as follows:\n($000) 2020 2019\nLevel 1 $ 159,116 $ 134,440\nLevel 2 — 7,003\nTotal $ 159,116 $ 141,443\nNote C: Management Incentive Plan and Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company also has an Incentive Compensation Plan which provides cash and performance share awards to key\nmanagement and employees based on Company and individual performance.\nManagement incentive plan and performance share award modifications. In August 2020, the Compensation Committee of\nthe Board of Directors approved modifications to the performance measurement goals for the management incentive plan and\nthe performance share award program for fiscal 2020, to be based on the attainment of specific management priorities related to\ntheir response to business challenges from COVID-19, as measured and approved by the Compensation Committee, as an\nalternative to the previously established profitability-based performance goals. As of January 30, 2021, the Company has\nestablished an accrual for this incentive compensation based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of progress\ntowards achievement of these specific priorities.\nFor fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:\n($000) 2020 2019 2018\nRestricted stock $ 66,908 $ 54,975 $ 48,585\nPerformance awards 30,506 36,542 43,450\nESPP 4,154 3,921 3,550\nTotal $ 101,568 $ 95,438 $ 95,585\nCapitalized stock-based compensation cost was not significant in any year.\nAt January 30, 2021, the Company had one active stock-based compensation plan, which is further described in Note H. The\nCompany recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the purchase date.\nTotal stock-based compensation recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2020, 2019, and\n2018 is as follows:\nStatements of Earnings Classification ($000) 2020 2019 2018\nCost of goods sold $ 52,267 $ 54,265 $ 45,052\nSelling, general and administrative 49,301 41,173 50,533\nTotal $ 101,568 $ 95,438 $ 95,585\nThe tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $20.6 million, $18.5 million,\nand $19.6 million, respectively.\n56\nNote D: Debt\nLong-term debt. Unsecured senior debt, net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, as of January 30, 2021 and\nFebruary 1, 2020 consisted of the following:\n($000) 2020 2019\n6.53% Series B Senior Notes due 2021 $ 64,910 $ 64,963\n3.375% Senior Notes due 2024 248,365 247,928\n4.600% Senior Notes due 2025 694,624 —\n0.875% Senior Notes due 2026 493,595 —\n4.700% Senior Notes due 2027 239,049 —\n4.800% Senior Notes due 2030 132,262 —\n1.875% Senior Notes due 2031 494,132 —\n5.450% Senior Notes due 2050 146,148 —\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,513,085 $ 312,891\nLess: current portion 64,910 —\nTotal due beyond one year $ 2,448,175 $ 312,891\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding Series B unsecured Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of\n$65 million, held by various institutional investors. The Series B notes are due in December 2021 and bear interest at a rate of\n6.530%. Borrowings under these Senior Notes are subject to certain financial covenants that were amended in June 2020, and\nare consistent with the corresponding covenants in the Company’s existing revolving credit facility. As of January 30, 2021, the\nCompany was in compliance with these covenants.\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Company also had outstanding unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 (the “2024\nNotes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually.\nIn April 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in four tenors as follows: 4.600%\nSenior Notes due April 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $700 million, 4.700% Senior Notes due\nApril 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, 4.800% Senior Notes due April 2030 (the “2030\nNotes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, and 5.450% Senior Notes due April 2050 (the “2050 Notes”) with an\naggregate principal amount of $500 million. Cash proceeds, net of discounts and other issuance costs, were approximately\n$1.973 billion. Interest on the 2025, 2027, 2030, and 2050 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning October 2020.\nIn October 2020, the Company accepted for purchase approximately $775 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes\npursuant to cash tender offers as follows: $351 million of the 2050 Notes, $266 million of the 2030 Notes, and $158 million of the\n2027 Notes. The Company paid approximately $1.003 billion in aggregate consideration (including transaction costs, and\naccrued and unpaid interest) and recorded an approximately $240 million loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted\nnotes.\nIn October 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in two tenors as follows: 0.875%\nSenior Notes due April 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 1.875% Senior Notes\ndue April 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Cash proceeds, net of discounts and other\nissuance costs, were approximately $987.2 million. Interest on the 2026 and 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning\nApril 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 and 2031 Notes to fund the purchase of the\naccepted notes from its tender offers.\nAs of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, total unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were $26.9 million and $2.1\nmillion, respectively, and were classified as a reduction of long-term debt.\nThe Series B and all of the Senior Notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal.\nAs of January 30, 2021, the aggregate fair value of the eight outstanding series of Senior Notes was approximately $2.8 billion.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the aggregate fair value of the two then outstanding series of Senior Notes was approximately $335\n57\nmillion. The fair value is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the\nfair value measurements and disclosures guidance.\nOn December 13, 2018, the Company repaid at maturity the $85 million principal amount of the Series A 6.38% unsecured\nSenior Notes.\nThe following table shows scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt:\n($000)\n2021 $ 65,000\n2022 $ —\n2023 $ —\n2024 $ 250,000\n2025 $ 700,000\nThereafter $ 1,524,991\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n($000) 2020 2019 2018\nInterest expense on long-term debt $ 88,544 $ 13,139 $ 17,900\nInterest expense on short-term debt 7,863 — —\nOther interest expense 3,908 968 1,004\nCapitalized interest (12,251) (4,367) (2,497)\nInterest income (4,651) (27,846) (26,569)\nInterest expense (income), net $ 83,413 $ (18,106) $ (10,162)\nRevolving credit facilities. In July 2019, the Company entered into a new $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which\nreplaced the Company’s previous $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This new credit facility expires in July 2024,\nand contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. The facility also contains an option allowing the\nCompany to increase the size of its credit facility by up to an additional $300 million, with the agreement of the lenders. Interest\non borrowings under this facility is based on LIBOR (or an alternate benchmark rate, if LIBOR is no longer available) plus an\napplicable margin and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. The revolving credit facility may be extended, at the Company's\noption, for up to two additional one year periods, subject to customary conditions.\nIn March 2020, the Company borrowed $800 million available under its revolving credit facility. Interest on the loan was based on\nLIBOR plus 0.875% (or 1.76%).\nIn May 2020, the Company amended its $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Amended Credit Facility”) to\ntemporarily suspend, for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, the Consolidated Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR ratio financial\ncovenant, and to apply a transitional modification to that ratio effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Amended Credit\nFacility also established a new temporary minimum liquidity requirement, effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and through\nthe end of April 2021. As of January 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these amended covenants.\nIn October 2020, the Company repaid in full the $800 million it borrowed under the unsecured revolving credit facility. As a result,\nthe Company currently has no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of January 30, 2021, and\nthe $800 million credit facility remains in place and available.\nIn May 2020, the Company also entered into an additional $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility which was\nscheduled to expire in April 2021.

Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\n68\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are\nno critical audit matters.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 30, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1982.\n69\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving their objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at that reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport.\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part\nupon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nestablished by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2021.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021 has also been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, and their opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting is stated in their report, dated March 30, 2021, which is included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be\nnoted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon\ncertain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nQuarterly Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation\nof our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020\nthat has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that\nevaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone\n70\nPART III\nITEM 10.
