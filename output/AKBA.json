Vafseo is approved for once-daily oral administration and is expected to be available in the U.S. in January 2025.\n\n\"The publication of the FO2CUS data in the _ American Journal of Kidney Disease_ is an important milestone and demonstrates Akebia's commitment to both research and to continuing to publish findings from its Vafseo trials,\" said Steven K. Burke, M.D., Senior Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer of Akebia.\n\nFO2CUS was an open-label, active-controlled, sponsor-blinded study that evaluated 456 hemodialysis patients who were randomized (1:1:1) into vadadustat 600mg, vadadustat 900mg, or a long-acting ESA (Mircera®) treatment arms. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in hemoglobin (Hb) between baseline and the primary evaluation period (weeks 20-26). The secondary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Hb between baseline and the secondary evaluation period (weeks 46-52). The top-line results of the FO2CUS study are available [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302749-1&h=1723661003&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.akebia.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fakebia-therapeutics-announces-positive-top-line-results&a=here).\n\nFirst published in 1981, the _American Journal of Kidney Diseases_ is the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation. AJKD is recognized worldwide as a leading source of information devoted to clinical nephrology research and practice. Articles selected for publication in AJKD undergo a rigorous peer review and editorial consideration process, including statistical review where appropriate, supporting the journal's goal to communicate important new information in clinical nephrology in a way that strengthens knowledge and helps physicians to provide their patients with the highest standard of care.\n\n**About Akebia Therapeutics**Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease. Akebia was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, please visit our website at [www.akebia.com](http://www.akebia.com), which does not form a part of this release.\n\n**About Vafseo® (vadadustat) tablets** Vafseo® (vadadustat) tablets is a once-daily oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that activates the physiologic response to hypoxia to stimulate endogenous production of erythropoietin, increasing hemoglobin and red blood cell production to manage anemia. Vafseo is approved for use in 37 countries.\n\n**INDICATION** VAFSEO is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who have been receiving dialysis for at least three months.\n\n_Limitations of Use_\n\n  * VAFSEO has not been shown to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being.\n  * VAFSEO is not indicated for use:\n    * As a substitute for red blood cell transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia.\n    * In patients with anemia due to CKD not on dialysis.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about VAFSEO (vadadustat) tablets**\n\n**WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, and THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS.****VAFSEO increases the risk of thrombotic vascular events, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).****Targeting a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events, as occurs with erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), which also increase erythropoietin levels.****No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, dose of VAFSEO, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks.****Use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions.**  \n---  \n  \n**CONTRAINDICATIONS**\n\n  * Known hypersensitivity to VAFSEO or any of its components\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n\n\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n  * **Increased Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction (MI), Stroke, Venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombosis of Vascular Access** A rise in hemoglobin (Hb) levels greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks can increase these risks. Avoid in patients with a history of MI, cerebrovascular event, or acute coronary syndrome within the 3 months prior to starting VAFSEO. Targeting a Hb level of greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events. Use the lowest effective dose to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Adhere to dosing and Hb monitoring recommendations to avoid excessive erythropoiesis.\n  * **Hepatotoxicity** Hepatocellular injury attributed to VAFSEO was reported in less than 1% of patients, including one severe case with jaundice. Elevated serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels were observed in 1.8%, 1.8%, and 0.3% of CKD patients treated with VAFSEO, respectively. Measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin before treatment and monthly for the first 6 months, then as clinically indicated. Discontinue VAFSEO if ALT or AST is persistently elevated or accompanied by elevated bilirubin. Not recommended in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease.\n  * **Hypertension** Worsening of hypertension was reported in 14% of VAFSEO and 17% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Serious worsening of hypertension was reported in 2.7% of VAFSEO and 3% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Cases of hypertensive crisis, including hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures, have also been reported in patients receiving VAFSEO. Monitor blood pressure. Adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as needed.\n  * **Seizures** Seizures occurred in 1.6% of VAFSEO and 1.6% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Monitor for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms, or change in seizure frequency.\n  * **Gastrointestinal (GI) Erosion** Gastric or esophageal erosions occurred in 6.4% of VAFSEO and 5.3% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Serious GI erosions, including GI bleeding and the need for RBC transfusions, were reported in 3.4% of VAFSEO and 3.3% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Consider this risk in patients at increased risk of GI erosion. Advise patients about signs of erosions and GI bleeding and urge them to seek prompt medical care if present.\n  * **Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Anemia Due to CKD and Not on Dialysis** The safety of VAFSEO has not been established for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adults not on dialysis and its use is not recommended in this setting. In large clinical trials in adults with anemia of CKD who were not on dialysis, an increased risk of mortality, stroke, MI, serious acute kidney injury, serious hepatic injury, and serious GI erosions was observed in patients treated with VAFSEO compared to darbepoetin alfa.\n  * **Malignancy** VAFSEO has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with active malignancies. Malignancies were observed in 2.2% of VAFSEO and 3.0% of darbepoetin alfa patients. No evidence of increased carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies.\n\n\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\n  * The most common adverse reactions (occurring at ≥ 10%) were hypertension and diarrhea.\n\n\n\n**DRUG INTERACTIONS**\n\n  * **Iron supplements and iron-containing phosphate binders:** Administer VAFSEO at least 1 hour before products containing iron.\n  * **Non-iron-containing phosphate binders** : Administer VAFSEO at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after non-iron-containing phosphate binders.\n  * **BCRP substrates** : Monitor for signs of substrate adverse reactions and consider dose reduction.\n  * **Statins** : Monitor for statin-related adverse reactions. Limit the daily dose of simvastatin to 20 mg and rosuvastatin to 5 mg.\n\n\n\n**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n  * Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm.\n  * Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended until two days after the final dose.\n  * Hepatic Impairment**:** Not recommended in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease.\n\n\n\n**Please note that this information is not comprehensive.
