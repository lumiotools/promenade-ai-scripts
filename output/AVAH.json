The overall increase in revenue was attributable to a $24.8 million increase in Private Duty Services (“PDS”) segment revenue, a $5.1 million increase in Medical Solutions (\"MS\") segment revenue, and a $1.2 million increase in Home Health & Hospice (“HHH”) segment revenue over the comparable quarter.\n\nGross margin was $159.7 million, or 31.4% of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to $147.3 million, or 30.8% of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $12.4 million, or 8.4%.\n\nNet loss was $42.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to net loss of $102.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per diluted share was $(0.22) for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to net loss per diluted share of $(0.54) for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.02 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to adjusted net loss per diluted share of $(0.03) for the third quarter of 2023. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share\" below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $47.8 million, or 9.4% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $36.2 million, or 7.6% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $11.7 million or 32.2%. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\" below.\n\n__Nine-Month Period Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023__\n\nRevenue was $1,504.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to $1,416.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $88.3 million, or 6.2%. The overall increase in revenue was attributable to a $77.1 million increase in Private Duty Services (“PDS”) segment revenue and a $12.4 million increase in Medical Solutions (\"MS\") segment revenue, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in Home Health & Hospice (“HHH”) segment revenue over the comparable period.\n\nGross margin was $463.8 million, or 30.8% of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to $447.0 million, or 31.6% of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $16.8 million, or 3.8%.\n\nNet loss was $40.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to net loss of $108.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.01 for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to adjusted net loss per diluted share of $(0.09) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share\" below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $128.4 million, or 8.5% of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to $100.5 million, or 7.1% of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $27.8 million or 27.7%. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\" below.\n\n**Liquidity, Cash Flow, and Debt**\n\n  * As of September 28, 2024, we had cash of $78.5 million and incremental borrowing capacity of $37.9 million under our securitization facility. Our revolver was undrawn, with approximately $168.2 million of borrowing capacity and approximately $31.8 million of outstanding letters of credit.\n  * 2024 net cash provided by operating activities was $19.2 million. Free cash flow was $16.7 million for 2024. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Free cash flow” below.\n  * As of September 28, 2024 we had bank debt of $1,480.2 million. Our interest rate exposure under our credit facilities is currently hedged with the following instruments: \n    * $520.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate, and\n    * $880.0 million notional amount of interest rate caps that cap our exposure to SOFR at 2.96%.\n\n\n\nMatt Buckhalter, Chief Financial Officer, commented “I am excited to report revenue growth of 6.5% and our Adjusted EBITDA growth of 32.2% compared to the prior year period. Our strategic cost reductions are driving this growth in profitability, alongside the success of our preferred payor strategy and improvements in rates from our Government Affairs efforts. Notably, both our operating cash flow and free cash flow turned positive year-to-date in the current quarter, reflecting the success in our overall strategy and the momentum we have generated in the business. Given our strong performance through the third quarter, we are raising our guidance to approximately $2.0 billion in revenue and greater than $168 million in Adjusted EBITDA. I am pleased with the strides we've made in executing our business plans, resulting in organic volume growth, improved clinical outcomes, and enhanced profitability.”\n\n**Revised Full Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe following is our updated guidance reflecting our current expectations for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024:\n\n  * Revenue of approximately $2.0 billion, updated from prior guidance of revenue of greater than $1,985 million\n\n\n\nConsistent with prior practice, we are not providing guidance on net income at this time due to the volatility of certain required inputs that are not available without unreasonable efforts, including future fair value adjustments associated with our interest rate swaps and caps.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of greater than $168 million, updated from prior guidance of Adjusted EBITDA greater than $158 million\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we also evaluate our financial performance using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Field contribution, Field contribution margin, Adjusted net income or loss, Adjusted net income or loss per diluted share, and Free cash flow. Given our determination of adjustments in arriving at our computations, these non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to net income or loss, revenue, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial tables below.\n\n_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income or loss. Rather, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance. We define EBITDA as net income or loss before interest expense, net; income tax benefit (expense); and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash, unusual, or items deemed by management to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations, including impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; non-cash, share-based compensation; loss on extinguishment of debt; fees related to debt modifications; the effect of interest rate derivatives; acquisition-related and integration costs; legal costs and settlements associated with acquisition matters; restructuring costs; other legal matters; and other system transition costs, professional fees and other costs. As non-GAAP financial measures, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from similarly termed non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable.\n\nWe believe our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance. In determining which adjustments are made to arrive at EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, we consider both (1) certain non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash or unusual items, which can vary significantly from year to year, as well as (2) certain other items that may be recurring, frequent, or settled in cash but which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess operating performance and make business decisions.\n\nWe have incurred substantial acquisition-related costs and integration costs. The underlying acquisition activities take place over a defined timeframe, have distinct project timelines and are incremental to activities and costs that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Therefore, we believe it is important to exclude these costs from our Adjusted EBITDA because it provides us a normalized view of our core, ongoing operations after integrating our acquired companies, which we believe is an important measure in assessing our performance.\n\n_Field contribution and Field contribution margin_\n\nField contribution and Field contribution margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, such as gross margin and gross margin percentage. Rather, we present Field contribution and Field contribution margin as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Field contribution as gross margin less branch and regional administrative expenses. Field contribution margin is Field contribution as a percentage of revenue. As non-GAAP financial measures, our computations of Field contribution and Field contribution margin may vary from similarly termed non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, making comparisons with other companies on the basis of these measures impracticable.\n\nField contribution and Field contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to gross margin, gross margin percentage, net income or loss, revenue, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nManagement believes Field contribution and Field contribution margin are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance and evaluating trends in our branch and regional results, which can vary from year to year. We use Field contribution and Field contribution margin to make business decisions and assess the operating performance and results delivered by our core field operations, prior to corporate and other costs not directly related to our field operations. These metrics are also important because they guide us in determining whether or not our branch and regional administrative expenses are appropriately sized to support our caregivers and direct patient care operations. Additionally, Field contribution and Field contribution margin determine how effective we are in managing our field supervisory and administrative costs associated with supporting our provision of services and sale of products.\n\n_Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share_\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) represents net income (loss) as adjusted for the impact of GAAP income tax, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived asset impairment charges, non-cash share-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, interest rate derivatives, acquisition-related costs, integration costs, legal costs, restructuring costs, other legal matters, other system transition costs, professional fees and certain other miscellaneous items on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted net income (loss) includes a provision for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory tax rate. The combined statutory tax rate is our estimate of our long-term tax rate. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss).\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) per diluted share represents adjusted net income (loss) on a per diluted share basis using the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. The most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) per share, diluted.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share are important to us because they allow us to assess financial results, exclusive of the items mentioned above that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of our competitors.\n\n_Free cash flow_\n\nFree cash flow is a liquidity measure that represents operating cash flow, adjusted for the impact of purchases of property, equipment and software, principal payments on term loans, notes payable and financing leases, and settlements with swap counterparties. The most comparable GAAP measure is cash flow from operations.\n\nWe believe free cash flow is helpful in highlighting the cash generated or used by the Company, after taking into consideration mandatory payments on term loans, notes payable and financing leases, as well as cash needed for non-acquisition related capital expenditures, and cash paid to or received from derivative counterparties.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAveanna will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss our second quarter results.
