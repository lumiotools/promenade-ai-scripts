The company recently reported fiscal year 2024 revenue of $29.6 million, an increase of 132% over fiscal year 2023, and a 53% increase in net income to $7.4 million, driven by rising demand for its AI products for clients in banking, insurance, mortgage sales, wealth management, government services, and real estate.\n\nMZ has developed a distinguished reputation as a premier resource for institutional investors, brokers, analysts, and private investors and maintains offices worldwide.

These partnerships underscore our adaptability in catering to complex industries, where accurate interpretation and communication are critical.\n\n“Our San Diego office will serve as our growth engine for the U.S. market and innovation, while our Singapore office will continue to be the center for global operations. This is expected to strengthen our presence in North America, especially as we see major breakthroughs with developing partnerships such as Google and eWorld Enterprise Solutions in supporting U.S. government sectors.\n\n“We are pleased to announce Helport AI’s official listing on Google Cloud Marketplace, a milestone that we believe will enhance our global reach and strengthen our technology and data security credibility. We trust that this presence will enable us to deliver scalable, high-performance AI solutions across industries, advancing operational efficiency and customer engagement. Looking forward, we will focus on expanding U.S. partnerships and strengthening our ecosystem to drive the next wave of intelligent customer interactions.\n\n“In the mid-term we plan to launch our Helport AI Developer Ecosystem (HDE). Inspired by NVIDIA’s CUDA platform, we are developing an open API interface that aims to enable thirty-party developers to create their own applications using our AI engine. This will allow any developers to innovate within our ecosystem, making it increasingly easy for anyone to innovate on our platform. By fostering this ecosystem, we aim to solidify our position as the go-to platform for AI-driven solutions across industries.\n\n“Taken together, we expect our revenue growth will sustain in 2025, driven by the full impact of our new partnerships and expanded U.S. presence. In addition, we will continue to prioritize R&D investments, particularly in the development of HDE, to support long-term innovation and expansion. We look forward to providing updates in the months to come, including those attending our Business Update Conference Call next Wednesday, November 6th,” concluded Li.\n\n**2024 Fiscal Year Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 increased by 132% to $29.6 million compared to $12.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an average monthly subscribed seats increase from 2,192 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 to 5,475 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, which was driven by (i) efforts in continuous optimization and development in service offerings and platform, (ii) capabilities to increase overall cost performance for customers in their business management process, and (iii) the growing demands in professional technology services market.\n\nGross Profit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 increased to $18.6 million compared to a gross profit of $7.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Gross margin was 62.8% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to 61.6% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The increases indicate that as sales increased, the Company was also able to optimize cost structure and achieve economic scale effect in the improvement of gross profit margin performance.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $5.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 from $1.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in withholding tax incurred from AI service provided to customers in the PRC subject to a 10% withholding tax rate.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased to $4.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, compared to $0.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the addition of AI training service fees and product development fees incurred during the year in order to enhance core competence to differentiate and diversify in products and service offerings with competitive technology, especially related to the development of AI technology application scenarios.\n\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was $7.4 million as compared with $4.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, an increase of 53%.\n\nCash was $2.6 million as of June 30, 2024, as compared to $0.1 million on June 30, 2023.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million in fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to net cash used of $0.5 million in fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Business Update Conference Call**\n\nGuanghai Li, Chief Executive Officer, and Tao Ke, Chief Financial Officer, will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer session.

Helport undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent occurring events or circumstances, or changes in its expectations, except as may be required by law. Although Helport believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot assure you that such expectations will turn out to be correct, and Helport cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results and encourages investors to review other factors that may affect its future results in Helport’s registration statement and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**For media inquiries, please visit:**[_https://ir.helport.ai/_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XKQbI1HleR8FbWJ8RZBkQP4Fu8wXdeAGEP2iAQ5bG2MePvp1LuLJXxFEKXd708_YCb6Y1K3DgI6ZMxyO62U2qRKhuEtI-zzGoCyLxgIU9JI=)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Chris TysonExecutive Vice PresidentMZ North AmericaDirect: 949-491-8235[ _HPAI@mzgroup.us_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JIo7ADdLt637SgZ0qmlINLtRbEm8sHaMd3WW7vYAU415UsOyz7m4LM48aq8K0HnvLF0a7HGL4fgxylBmmN2y5A==)[ _www.mzgroup.us_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WjDP6qyMDznVWLF8cVRmDBgkuOLKfkqDpJmX5WEjezTui5NaDJ1ofd534ZtvO-mdcDEISVGcQb8OdGC2Z5VhTQ==)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MDg5NzQ1ODYtZDJmMi00OGY3LWE0MGUtMDBhZDgyMGMyZTE2LTEzMDQzMTg=/tiny/Helport-AI-Inc-.png)\n"
