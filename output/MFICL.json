The Company’s net investment income was $0.44 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.45 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) was $15.10 per share as of September 30, 2024.\n\nOn November 6, 2024, the Board declared a dividend of $0.38 per share payable on December 26, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 10, 2024.\n\nMr. Tanner Powell, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “This quarter MFIC successfully closed its mergers with AFT and AIF which we believe will create significant long-term value for our stockholders. Our focus is on exiting the acquired non-directly originated assets and prudently deploying the investment capacity created from the mergers into directly originated middle market loans. We are fortunate to have access to all the necessary origination to deploy this capital, thanks to the significant volume of loans originated by MidCap Financial, a leading middle market lender with one of the largest direct lending teams in the U.S. and which is managed by Apollo.” Mr. Powell added, “For the quarter, we produced solid net investment income despite the modest amount of fee and prepayment income, reflecting the impact of the total return feature in our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a partial incentive fee for the quarter. NAV declined during the quarter due to the $0.20 per share special distribution paid in connection with the mergers as well as a modest net loss on the portfolio.”\n\n___________________\n\n(1) On July 22, 2024, the Company completed its mergers with Apollo Senior Floating Rate Fund Inc. (“AFT”) and Apollo Tactical Income Fund Inc. (“AIF”) (together, the “Mergers”). The Mergers have been accounted for in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805-50, Business Combinations-Related Issues.(2) Commitments made for the direct origination portfolio.(3) Excludes assets acquired from the Mergers.(4) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, direct origination revolver fundings totaled $28 million, direct origination revolver repayments totaled $15 million, and the Company received a $7.5 million revolver paydown from Merx Aviation Finance, LLC.(5) The Company’s net leverage ratio is defined as debt outstanding plus payable for investments purchased, less receivable for investments sold, less cash and cash equivalents, less foreign currencies, divided by net assets.(6) On October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended the Facility. Lender commitments under the Amended Senior Secured Facility total $1.660 billion, an increase of $110 million, excluding non-extending lender commitments. Lender commitments under the Amended Senior Secured Facility total $1.815 billion, including $155 million of commitments from non-extending lenders which are set to terminate on December 22, 2024. The final maturity date under the Amended Senior Secured Facility for extending lenders was extended from April 19, 2028, to October 17, 2029. The remaining material business terms of the Facility will remain substantially the same.\n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**($ in billions, except per share data)**| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30,** **2024**| **March 31,** **2024**| **December 31,** **2023**| **September 30,** **2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTotal assets| $| 3.22| $| 2.55| $| 2.45| $| 2.50| $| 2.46  \nInvestment portfolio (fair value)| $| 3.03| $| 2.44| $| 2.35| $| 2.33| $| 2.37  \nDebt outstanding| $| 1.77| $| 1.51| $| 1.41| $| 1.46| $| 1.43  \nNet assets| $| 1.42| $| 1.00| $| 1.01| $| 1.01| $| 0.99  \nNet asset value per share| $| 15.10| $| 15.38| $| 15.42| $| 15.41| $| 15.28  \nDebt-to-equity ratio| 1.25 x| 1.51 x| 1.40 x| 1.45 x| 1.44 x  \nNet leverage ratio (1)| 1.16 x| 1.45 x| 1.35 x| 1.34 x| 1.40 x  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1) The Company’s net leverage ratio is defined as debt outstanding plus payable for investments purchased, less receivable for investments sold, less cash and cash equivalents, less foreign currencies, divided by net assets.\n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(in millions)***|  **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nInvestments made in portfolio companies (1)| $| 911.9| $| 30.3| $| 1,310.1| $| 283.0  \nInvestments sold (1)| (188.5| )| —| (188.5| )| —  \nNet activity before repaid investments (1)| 723.4| 30.3| 1,121.6| 283.0  \nInvestments repaid (1)| (138.8| )| (72.9| )| (430.6| )| (323.7| )  \nNet investment activity| $| 584.6| $| (42.6| )| $| 691.0| $| (40.6| )  \nPortfolio companies, at beginning of period| 165| 150| 152| 135  \nNumber of investments in new portfolio companies (1)| 131| 2| 156| 22  \nNumber of exited companies (1)| (46| )| (3| )| (58| )| (8| )  \nPortfolio companies at end of period (1)| 250| 149| 250| 149  \nNumber of investments in existing portfolio companies| 60| 32| 97| 68  \n  \n____________________\n\n* Totals may not foot due to rounding.\n\n(1) Includes investments acquired from the Mergers.\n\n**OPERATING RESULTS**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(in millions)***|  **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet investment income| $| 38.1| $| 27.9| $| 96.2| $| 86.2  \nNet realized and change in unrealized gains (losses)| (11.4| )| (2.1| )| (21.5| )| (0.7| )  \nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations| $| 26.7| $| 30.0| $| 74.8| $| 85.5  \n**(per share)* (1)**  \nNet investment income on per average share basis| $| 0.44| $| 0.43| $| 1.32| $| 1.32  \nNet realized and change in unrealized gain (loss) per share| (0.13| )| 0.03| (0.30| )| (0.01| )  \nEarnings per share — basic| $| 0.31| $| 0.46| $| 1.03| $| 1.31  \n  \n____________________\n\n* Totals may not foot due to rounding.\n\n(1) Based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period presented.\n\n**SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ***\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares.\n\nSince the inception of the share repurchase program and through November 6, 2024, the Company repurchased 15,593,120 shares at a weighted average price per share of $15.91, inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $248.1 million, leaving a maximum of $26.9 million available for future purchases under the current Board authorization of $275 million.\n\n* Share figures have been adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split which was completed after market close on November 30, 2018.\n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s outstanding debt obligations, excluding deferred financing cost and debt discount of $6.1 million, totaled $1.779 billion which was comprised of $350 million of Senior Unsecured Notes (the “2025 Notes”) which will mature on March 3, 2025, $125 million of Senior Unsecured Notes (the “2026 Notes”) which will mature on July 16, 2026, $80 million of Senior Unsecured Notes (the “2028 Notes”) which will mature on December 15, 2028, $232 million outstanding Class A-1 Notes under the CLO and $991.9 million outstanding under the Facility. As of September 30, 2024, $15.8 million in standby letters of credit were issued through the Facility. The available remaining capacity under the Facility was $697.3 million as of September 30, 2024, which is subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company’s portfolio.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended the Facility. Lender commitments under the Amended Senior Secured Facility will increase from $1.705 billion to $1.815 billion until December 22, 2024 and will decrease to $1.660 billion thereafter. The Amended Senior Secured Facility includes an “accordion” feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Facility to $2.723 billion.\n\nThe final maturity date under the Amended Senior Secured Facility for extending lenders was extended by over a year from April 19, 2028 to October 17, 2029. The covenants and representations and warranties the Company is required to comply with were also modified (including, among other things, that the minimum stockholders’ equity test was reset), but the remaining material business terms and conditions of the Amended Senior Secured Facility remain substantially the same. The Amended Senior Secured Facility continues to include usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this type.\n\nBorrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue to be subject to compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company’s portfolio. The advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the Company’s portfolio depends on the relevant asset coverage ratio as of the date of determination. Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility continue to be subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Terms used in this disclosure have the meanings set forth in the Amended Senior Secured Facility.\n\n**MERGERS**\n\nOn July 22, 2024, the Company completed its mergers of AFT and AIF. Pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement, AFT Merger Sub was first merged with and into AFT, with AFT continuing as the surviving company, and, following the effectiveness of the AFT First Merger, AFT was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the AFT Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the AFT First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AFT was converted into the right to receive 0.9547 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with AFT stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). Pursuant to the AIF Merger Agreement, AIF Merger Sub was first merged with and into AIF, with AIF continuing as the surviving company, and, following the effectiveness of the AIF First Merger, AIF was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the AIF Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the AIF First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AIF was converted into the right to receive 0.9441 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with AIF stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). As a result of the Mergers, the Company issued an aggregate of 28,527,003 shares of its common stock to former AFT and AIF stockholders.\n\nThe Mergers were considered asset acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles with the Company being the accounting survivor. The Mergers were accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting by the Company in accordance with ASC 805. Under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. Per ASC 805-50-30-1, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes transaction costs of the asset acquisition, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets’ carrying amounts on the acquiring entity’s records. ASC 805-50-30-2 provides that asset acquisitions in which the consideration given is cash are measured by the amount of cash paid. However, if the consideration given is not in the form of cash (that is, in the form of noncash assets, liabilities incurred, or equity interests issued), measurement is based on the cost to the acquiring entity or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measured.\n\nThe Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former AFT and AIF stockholders pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement and AIF Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Mergers under ASC 805. The consideration paid to AFT and AIF stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the AFT and AIF assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). Since the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the merger consideration paid by the Company, the Company recognized a deemed contribution from Investment Adviser.\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL / WEBCAST AT 8:30 AM EST ON NOVEMBER 7, 2024**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

(NYSE: AFT) and Apollo Tactical Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: AIF) (AFT and AIF, together, the “CEFs”). The combined company will operate as MidCap Financial Investment Corporation and will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “MFIC.”\n\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers, former AFT stockholders will receive 0.9547 shares of MFIC common stock for each share of AFT common stock they held prior to the closing based on the final exchange ratio, subject to adjustments for cash payable in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, former AIF stockholders will receive 0.9441 shares of MFIC common stock for each share of AIF common stock they held prior to the closing based on the final exchange ratio, subject to adjustments for cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.\n\nThe final exchange ratios were based on MFIC’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share of $15.43, AFT’s NAV per share of $14.73, and AIF’s NAV per share of $14.57, each calculated as of July 19, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, MFIC’s NAV per share was $15.38, AFT’s NAV per share was $14.89, and AIF’s NAV per share was $14.77. MFIC’s NAV per share as of June 30, 2024 reflects net investment income of $0.45 per share for the June quarter and certain adjustments to the fair value of its investment portfolio. The change in MFIC’s NAV per share between June 30, 2024 and July 19, 2024 was primarily the result of the accrual of net income. The change in the CEFs’ NAVs per share between June 30, 2024 and July 19, 2024 was primarily the result of the accrual of net income and the pre-merger distributions that were declared and paid to their respective stockholders. As a result of the mergers, legacy MFIC stockholders, former AFT stockholders, and former AIF stockholders own approximately 69.6%, 15.8%, and 14.6%, respectively, of the combined company. Each merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal tax purposes.\n\nCertain financial highlights for the combined company as of the closing of the mergers include:\n\nInvestments, at fair value:| $3.07 billion  \n---|---  \nNet assets:| $1.45 billion1  \nNet leverage ratio:| 1.13x1,2  \nCommon shares outstanding:| 93.8 million1,3  \n% of total investments on non-accrual status, at amortized cost / at fair value:| 2.3%/1.8%4  \n  \n________________________1 Subject to adjustments for cash payable to former AFT and AIF stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.2 MFIC’s net leverage ratio is defined as debt outstanding plus payable for investments purchased, less receivable for investments sold, less cash and cash equivalents, less foreign currencies, divided by net assets.3 As of result of the mergers, MFIC issued approximately 28.5 million shares of common stock to former AFT and AIF stockholders. 4 As of the closing of the mergers, 11 companies were on non-accrual status, including 6 companies acquired from the CEF’s portfolios. \n\nFinancial highlights presented above exclude any impact from purchase accounting adjustments.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers, on July 21, 2024, MFIC’s Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.20 per share, to be payable on August 15, 2024, to MFIC stockholders of record as of August 5, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the mergers, Lazard served as financial advisor and Proskauer Rose LLP as legal counsel to the special committee of MFIC. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., _A Stifel Company_ , served as financial advisor and Dechert LLP as legal counsel to the special committees of the CEFs.

Therefore, an additional 3.98% of AIF’s outstanding shares are needed to vote “FOR” the AIF Merger Proposal in order to achieve the necessary threshold. **_The Board of Directors of AIF unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the AIF Merger Proposal._**\n\nIn addition, AFT and AIF are pleased to announce that ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended that stockholders vote “FOR” the AFT Merger Proposal and the AIF Merger Proposal, respectively.\n\nThe record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the AFT Special Meeting and the AIF Special Meeting will remain the close of business on March 28, 2024. Stockholders as of the record date can vote, even if they have subsequently sold their shares. Stockholders who have already voted do not need to recast their votes. Proxies previously submitted will be voted at the reconvened meetings unless properly revoked.\n\nDuring the adjournment period, AFT and AIF and their independent proxy solicitor, Broadridge Financial Solutions (“Broadridge”), will continue to solicit votes from stockholders. _AFT and AIF encourage any stockholder that has not yet voted to contact their broker, bank or Broadridge at 1-855-200-8397._ The Boards of Directors of AFT and AIF respectively request stockholders vote their proxies as soon as possible to ensure that the Special Meetings can occur without further delay. Voting today will help us reduce the risk of an additional meeting adjournment and the incurrence of additional solicitation costs.\n\n**About MidCap Financial Investment Corporation**\n\nMidCap Financial Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: MFIC) is a closed-end, externally managed, diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”).

The Company’s net\ninvestment income was $0.44 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.45 per share for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) was $15.10 per share as of September 30,\n2024.\nOn November 6, 2024, the Board declared a dividend of $0.38 per share payable on December 26, 2024 to\nstockholders of record as of December 10, 2024.\nMr. Tanner Powell, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “This quarter MFIC successfully closed its\nmergers with AFT and AIF which we believe will create significant long-term value for our stockholders. Our focus\nis on exiting the acquired non-directly originated assets and prudently deploying the investment capacity created from\nthe mergers into directly originated middle market loans. We are fortunate to have access to all the necessary\norigination to deploy this capital, thanks to the significant volume of loans originated by MidCap Financial, a leading\nmiddle market lender with one of the largest direct lending teams in the U.S. and which is managed by Apollo.” Mr.\n1\nPowell added, “For the quarter, we produced solid net investment income despite the modest amount of fee and\nprepayment income, reflecting the impact of the total return feature in our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a\npartial incentive fee for the quarter. NAV declined during the quarter due to the $0.20 per share special distribution\npaid in connection with the mergers as well as a modest net loss on the portfolio.”\n___________________\n(1) On July 22, 2024, the Company completed its mergers with Apollo Senior Floating Rate Fund Inc. (“AFT”) and Apollo Tactical Income Fund Inc. (“AIF”)\n(together, the “Mergers”). The Mergers have been accounted for in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805-50, Business\nCombinations-Related Issues.\n(2) Commitments made for the direct origination portfolio.\n(3) Excludes assets acquired from the Mergers.\n(4) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, direct origination revolver fundings totaled $28 million, direct origination revolver repayments totaled $15\nmillion, and the Company received a $7.5 million revolver paydown from Merx Aviation Finance, LLC.\n(5) The Company’s net leverage ratio is defined as debt outstanding plus payable for investments purchased, less receivable for investments sold, less cash and\ncash equivalents, less foreign currencies, divided by net assets.\n(6) On October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended the Facility.

As of September 30, 2024, $15.8 million in standby letters of credit were issued through the Facility. The\navailable remaining capacity under the Facility was $697.3 million as of September 30, 2024, which is subject to\ncompliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company’s\nportfolio.\nOn October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended the Facility. Lender commitments under the Amended\nSenior Secured Facility will increase from $1.705 billion to $1.815 billion until December 22, 2024 and will decrease\nto $1.660 billion thereafter.

The covenants and representations and warranties the Company is\nrequired to comply with were also modified (including, among other things, that the minimum stockholders’ equity\ntest was reset), but the remaining material business terms and conditions of the Amended Senior Secured Facility\nremain substantially the same. The Amended Senior Secured Facility continues to include usual and customary events\nof default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this type.\nBorrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue\nto be subject to compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in\nthe Company’s portfolio. The advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the Company’s portfolio depends\non the relevant asset coverage ratio as of the date of determination. Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured\nFacility continue to be subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the “1940 Act”). Terms used in this disclosure have the meanings set forth in the Amended Senior Secured\nFacility.\n5\nMERGERS\nOn July 22, 2024, the Company completed its mergers of AFT and AIF. Pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement,\nAFT Merger Sub was first merged with and into AFT, with AFT continuing as the surviving company, and, following\nthe effectiveness of the AFT First Merger, AFT was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company\ncontinuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the AFT Merger Agreement, at the effective\ntime of the AFT First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AFT was\nconverted into the right to receive 0.9547 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with\nAFT stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). Pursuant to the AIF Merger Agreement,\nAIF Merger Sub was first merged with and into AIF, with AIF continuing as the surviving company, and, following\nthe effectiveness of the AIF First Merger, AIF was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company\ncontinuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the AIF Merger Agreement, at the effective\ntime of the AIF First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AIF was\nconverted into the right to receive 0.9441 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with\nAIF stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). As a result of the Mergers, the Company\nissued an aggregate of 28,527,003 shares of its common stock to former AFT and AIF stockholders.\nThe Mergers were considered asset acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles with the Company\nbeing the accounting survivor. The Mergers were accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting by\nthe Company in accordance with ASC 805. Under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only\nrequires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or\nindividual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. Per ASC 805-50-30-1, assets are recognized based on their\ncost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes transaction costs of the asset acquisition, and no gain or loss is\nrecognized unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets’ carrying amounts on\nthe acquiring entity’s records. ASC 805-50-30-2 provides that asset acquisitions in which the consideration given is\ncash are measured by the amount of cash paid. However, if the consideration given is not in the form of cash (that is,\nin the form of noncash assets, liabilities incurred, or equity interests issued), measurement is based on the cost to the\nacquiring entity or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus,\nmore reliably measured.\nThe Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former\nAFT and AIF stockholders pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement and AIF Merger Agreement plus transaction costs\nto be the consideration paid in connection with the Mergers under ASC 805. The consideration paid to AFT and AIF\nstockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the AFT and AIF assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which\nresulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). Since the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the\nmerger consideration paid by the Company, the Company recognized a deemed contribution from Investment\nAdviser.\n6\nCONFERENCE CALL / WEBCAST AT 8:30 AM EST ON NOVEMBER 7, 2024\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Organization\nMidCap Financial Investment Corporation (the “Company,” “MFIC,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), a Maryland corporation incorporated\non February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, externally managed, diversified management investment company that has elected to be\ntreated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). In addition,\nfor tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 receiving net proceeds of $870,000\nfrom our initial public offering by selling 62 million shares of common stock at a price of $15.00 per share (20.7 million shares\nat a price of $45.00 per share adjusted for the one-for-three reverse stock split). Since then, and through September 30, 2024, we\nhave raised approximately $2,680,207 in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock, including the Mergers with\nAFT and AIF (see Note 10 “Mergers with AFT and AIF” for additional information), and repurchased common stock for\n$248,107.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Company changed its name from “Apollo Investment Corporation” to “MidCap Financial Investment\nCorporation”. Our common stock began to trade under the ticker “MFIC” on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market on August 12,\n2022.\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors (the “Board”) changed the Company’s fiscal year end from March 31\nto December 31, effective December 31, 2022.\nOn November 7, 2023, the Company entered into (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “AFT Merger Agreement”) with\nApollo Senior Floating Rate Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation (“AFT”), AFT Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and a\ndirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“AFT Merger Sub”), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein,\nApollo Investment Management, L.P. (the “Investment Adviser\" or \"AIM”), and (ii) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “AIF\nMerger Agreement” and, together with the AFT Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”) with Apollo Tactical Income\nFund Inc., a Maryland corporation (“AIF”), AIF Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary\nof the Company (“AIF Merger Sub”), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Investment Adviser. The Merger\nAgreements provide that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Merger Agreement, at the effective time\nof such merger, AFT and AIF will, through a two-step merger process, merge with and into the Company, with the Company\ncontinuing as the surviving company. Each of the Company’s Board, and AFT’s and AIF’s Board of Directors, including all of\nthe respective independent directors, in each case, on the recommendation of special committees comprised solely of certain\nindependent directors of the Company or AFT and AIF, as applicable, approved the applicable Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby. The Company's stockholders approved the necessary proposal related to the mergers of AFT\nand AIF with and into the Company at a special meeting of stockholders held on May 28, 2024. AFT and AIF received stockholder\napproval of the necessary proposals related to their previously announced mergers with and into the Company at the AFT and\nAIF special meetings of stockholders reconvened on June 21, 2024. On July 22, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of\nAFT and AIF. For more information on the Mergers, please see Note 10 “Mergers with AFT and AIF” to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report.\nApollo Investment Management, L.P. is our investment adviser and an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries (“AGM”). The Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors,\nmanages the day-to-day operations of and provides investment advisory services to the Company.\nApollo Investment Administration, LLC (the “Administrator” or “AIA”), an affiliate of AGM, provides, among other things,\nadministrative services and facilities for the Company. Furthermore, AIA provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those\nportfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.\n79\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We primarily invest\nin directly originated and privately negotiated first lien senior secured loans to privately held U.S. middle-market companies,\nwhich the Company generally defines as companies with less than $75 million in EBITDA, as may be adjusted for market\ndisruptions, mergers and acquisitions-related charges and synergies, and other items. To a lesser extent, we may invest in other\ntypes of securities including first lien unitranche, second lien senior secured, unsecured, subordinated, and mezzanine loans, and\nequities in both private and public middle market companies.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a summary of the significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) pursuant to the requirements on Form 10-Q, ASC 946, Financial Services\n— Investment Companies (“ASC 946”), and Articles 6, 10 and 12 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements for the periods presented, have been included.\nUnder the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating\nany entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to\nbenefit us.\nThese consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the\nreported amounts of income, expenses, gains and losses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic environment,\nfinancial markets, credit worthiness of our portfolio companies, and any other parameters used in determining these estimates\ncould cause actual results to differ materially.\nConsolidation\nAs provided under Regulation S-X and ASC 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a company other than an\ninvestment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company.\nAccordingly, the Company consolidated the results of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAs of September 30, 2024 the Company's consolidated subsidiaries were MFIC Bethesda CLO 1 LLC, Bethesda CLO 1 Depositor\nLLC, MFIC Amplify SPV LLC, MFIC Lender LLC, MFIC Omada SPV LLC, MFIC Ostrich SPV LLC and MFIC Transformer\nSPV LLC.\n80\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and near maturity\nthat they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a\nmaturity of three months or less from the date of purchase would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company deems that\ncertain money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would\nqualify as cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents held as of September 30,\n2024 was $84,480. Cash and cash equivalents held as of December 31, 2023 was $93,575.\nCollateral on Option Contracts\nCollateral on option contracts represents restricted cash held by our counterparty as collateral against our derivative instruments\nuntil such contracts mature or are settled upon per agreement of buyer and seller of the contract. In accordance with ASC 230,\nStatement of Cash Flows, the Statements of Cash Flows outline the changes in cash, including both restricted and unrestricted\ncash, cash equivalents and foreign currencies. As of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany did not hold any derivative contracts.\nInvestment Transactions\nInvestments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains and\nlosses related to that instrument. Investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and\nforego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Specifically, we record all security transactions on a trade date basis.\nAmounts for investments recognized or derecognized but not yet settled are reported as a receivable for investments sold and a\npayable for investments purchased, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), where fair value is defined as the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value measurements are determined within a framework that establishes a three-tier hierarchy which\nmaximizes the use of observable market data and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to establish a classification of fair\nvalue measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure\nfair value using a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs for the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or\nunobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on\nmarket data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions\nabout the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the information available. The\ninputs or methodology used for valuing assets or liabilities may not be an indication of the risks associated with investing in those\nassets or liabilities.\n81\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined\nbased on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a\nparticular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nThe level assigned to the investment valuations may not be indicative of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in such\ninvestments. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the Consolidated financial statements may\ndiffer materially from the values that would be received upon an actual disposition of such investments.\nInvestment Valuation Process\nThe Board has designated the Investment Adviser as its “valuation designee” pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and in\nthat role the Investment Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of the Company's\ninvestments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value\nmethodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Board. Even though the\nBoard designated the Company's Investment Adviser as “valuation designee,” the Board continues to be responsible for\noverseeing the processes for determining fair valuation.\nUnder the Company's valuation policies and procedures, the Investment Adviser values investments, including certain secured\ndebt, unsecured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily\navailable, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). We attempt to obtain market quotations\nfrom at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker, primary market dealer or other\nindependent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within\nthe range is more representative. If and when market quotations are unavailable or are deemed not to represent fair value, we\ntypically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go\nthrough our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each case, our independent third party valuation firms consider\nobservable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such\ninvestments. Investments purchased within the quarter before the valuation date and debt investments with remaining maturities\nof 60 days or less may each be valued at cost with interest accrued or discount accreted/premium amortized to the date of maturity\n(although they are typically valued at available market quotations), unless such valuation, in the judgment of our Investment\nAdviser, does not represent fair value. In this case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by\nor under the direction of the Investment Adviser including using market quotations where available. Investments that are not\npublicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or\nunder the direction of the Investment Adviser. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates.\n82\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed\nnot to represent fair value, our Investment Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n1. Our quarterly valuation process begins with independent valuation firms conducting independent appraisals and\nassessments for all the investments they have been engaged to review. If an independent valuation firm is not engaged\nduring a particular quarter, the valuation may be conducted by the Investment Adviser;\n2. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our Investment\nAdviser.\n3. The Investment Adviser discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in our\nportfolio based on the input of the applicable independent valuation firm.\n4. For Level 3 investments entered into within the current quarter, the cost (purchase price adjusted for accreted original\nissue discount/amortized premium) or any recent comparable trade activity on the security investment shall be\nconsidered to reasonably approximate the fair value of the investment, provided that no material change has since\noccurred in the issuer’s business, significant inputs or the relevant environment.\nInvestments determined by these valuation procedures which have a fair value of less than $1 million during the prior fiscal\nquarter may be valued based on inputs identified by the Investment Adviser without the necessity of obtaining valuation from an\nindependent valuation firm, if once annually an independent valuation firm using the procedures described herein provides an\nindependent assessment of value. Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or\nboth approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions\ninvolving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to\nconvert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based\non the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of\nfactors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data,\nincluding relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security\ncovenants, seniority of investment in the investee company’s capital structure, call protection provisions, information rights, the\nnature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash\nflows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are\npublic, M&A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When readily\navailable, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the Company’s valuation techniques\nand related inputs considered in the valuation process.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated financial statements.\nDerivative contracts entered into by the Company are not designated as hedging instruments, and as a result the Company presents\nchanges in fair value and realized gains or losses through current period earnings.\nDerivative instruments are measured in terms of the notional contract amount and derive their value based upon one or more\nunderlying instruments. Derivative instruments are subject to various risks similar to non-derivative instruments including\nmarket, credit, liquidity, and operational risks. The Company manages these risks on an aggregate basis as part of its risk\nmanagement process. The derivatives may require the Company to pay or receive an upfront fee or premium. These upfront fees\nor premiums are carried forward as cost or proceeds to the derivatives.\n83\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nExchange-traded derivatives which include put and call options are valued based on the last reported sales price on the date of\nvaluation. Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, including credit default swaps, are valued by the Investment Adviser using\nquotations from counterparties. In instances where models are used, the value of the OTC derivative is derived from the\ncontractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability and reliability of observable inputs,\nsuch as credit spreads.\nAs of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not hold any derivative contracts.\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company has elected not to offset cash collateral against the fair value of derivative contracts. The fair values of these\nderivatives are presented on a gross basis, even when derivatives are subject to master netting agreements.\nAs of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not hold any derivative contracts.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure certain assets and liabilities\nat fair value (the “Fair Value Option”). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial\nliabilities. Debt issued by the Company is reported at amortized cost (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The\ncarrying value of all other financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their short maturities or their close\nproximity of the originations to the measurement date.\nRealized Gains or Losses\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are calculated by using the\nspecific identification method. Securities that have been called by the issuer are recorded at the call price on the call effective\ndate.\nInvestment Income Recognition\nThe Company records interest and dividend income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an\naccrual basis. Some of our loans and other investments, including certain preferred equity investments, may have contractual\npayment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected\nas receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in\ncash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity\ndates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or\ndividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at\nmaturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point the Company believes PIK is not fully\nexpected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual\nstatus, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend\nincome, respectively. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK\nis subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored\nto accrual status if the Company believes that PIK is expected to be realized.\n84\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nInvestments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and/or dividends in cash are generally placed on non-accrual\nstatus when principal or interest/dividend cash payments are past due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that\nprincipal or interest/dividend cash payments will be collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past\ndue principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash, and in management’s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of\ntheir remaining interest or dividend obligations. Interest or dividend cash payments received on non-accrual designated\ninvestments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount (“OID”), and market discounts are capitalized and accreted into interest income\nover the respective terms of the applicable loans using the effective interest method or straight-line, as applicable. Upon the\nprepayment of a loan, prepayment premiums, any unamortized loan origination fees, OID, or market discounts are recorded as\ninterest income. Other income generally includes amendment fees, bridge fees, and structuring fees which are recorded when\nearned.\nThe Company records as dividend income the accretable yield from its beneficial interests in structured products such as CLOs\nbased upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. Such assumptions include the\nrate and timing of principal and interest receipts (which may be subject to prepayments and defaults) of the underlying pool of\nassets. These assumptions are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular security, actual\nhistorical data, and market changes. A structured product investment typically has an underlying pool of assets. Payments on\nstructured product investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such assets. As such, any unforeseen\nevent in these underlying pools of assets might impact the expected recovery of principal and future accrual of income.\nExpenses\nExpenses include management fees, performance-based incentive fees, interest expense, insurance expenses, administrative\nservice fees, legal fees, directors’ fees, audit and tax service expenses, third-party valuation fees and other general and\nadministrative expenses. Expenses are recognized on an accrual basis.\nFinancing Costs\nThe Company records expenses related to shelf filings and applicable offering costs as deferred financing costs in the\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. To the extent such expenses relate to equity offerings, these expenses are\ncharged as a reduction of capital upon utilization, in accordance with ASC 946-20-25, or charged to expense if no offering is\ncompleted.\nThe Company records origination and other expenses related to its debt obligations as deferred financing costs. The deferred\nfinancing cost for all outstanding debt is presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability,\nexcept that incurred under the Senior Secured Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), which the\nCompany presents as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These expenses are deferred and\namortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation which approximates the\neffective yield method. In the event that we modify or extinguish our debt before maturity, the Company follows the guidance in\nASC 470-50, Modification and Extinguishments (“ASC 470-50”). For modifications to or exchanges of our Senior Secured\nFacility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), any unamortized deferred financing costs relating to\nlenders who are not part of the new lending group are expensed. For extinguishments of our senior secured notes and senior\nunsecured notes, any unamortized deferred financing costs are deducted from the carrying amount of the debt in determining the\ngain or loss from the extinguishment.\n85\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nForeign Currency Translations\nThe accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\nare translated into U.S. dollars based on the foreign exchange rate on the date of valuation. The Company does not isolate that\nportion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising\nfrom changes in market prices of securities held. The Company’s investments in foreign securities may involve certain risks,\nincluding without limitation: foreign exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic risks, all\nof which could affect the market and/or credit risk of the investment. In addition, changes in the relationship of foreign currencies\nto the U.S. dollar can significantly affect the value of these investments and therefore the earnings of the Company.\nDividends and Distributions\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded as of the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a\ndistribution is determined by the Board each quarter. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed or deemed\ndistributed at least annually. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio\ncompanies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nShare Repurchases\nIn connection with the Company’s share repurchase program, the cost of shares repurchased is charged to net assets on the trade\ndate.\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable\nto RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must (among other requirements) meet certain source-of-income and asset\ndiversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income as\ndefined by the Code, for each year. The Company (among other requirements) has made and intends to continue to make the\nrequisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from corporate-level income taxes. For\nincome tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of\ncapital, or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include\nreturn of capital, however, the exact amount cannot be determined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of\ndistributions will not be made until we file our tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2024. The character of income\nand gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and\ntax basis differences relating to stockholder dividend and distributions and other permanent book and tax difference are\nreclassified to paid-in capital.\nIf we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our\ncapital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which\n98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the\nyear. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current\nyear dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated undistributed taxable income.\n86\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nIf we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be\nsubject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distribution would generally be taxable to our individual\nand other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to\nqualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and\nother requirements are met. Subject to certain limitation under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the\ndividend-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to\nour stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC\nfor a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect\nto recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss\nthat would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized\nfor a period of five years.\nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be\nrecognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-\nlikely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\nthreshold are recorded as a tax expense in the current year. Penalties or interest, if applicable, that may be assessed relating to\nincome taxes would be classified as other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024,\nthere were no uncertain tax positions and no amounts accrued for interest or penalties. Management’s determinations regarding\nASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going\nanalysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major\ntax jurisdiction is federal.\nRetroactive Adjustments for Common Stock Reverse Split\nThe Company’s Board approved a one-for-three reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock on October 30, 2018, which\nwas effective as of close of business as of November 30, 2018 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). All common share and common per\nshare amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented\nto give effect to this reverse stock split as disclosed in Note 7.\nPurchase Accounting\nPursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement, AFT Merger Sub was first merged with and into AFT, with AFT continuing as the\nsurviving company (the “AFT First Merger”), and, following the effectiveness of the AFT First Merger, AFT was then merged\nwith and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company (together with the AFT First Merger, the\n“AFT Mergers”). Pursuant to the AIF Merger Agreement, AIF Merger Sub was first merged with and into AIF, with AIF\ncontinuing as the surviving company (the “AIF First Merger”), and, following the effectiveness of the AIF First Merger, AIF was\nthen merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company (together with the AIF First\nMerger, the “AIF Mergers” and, together with the AFT Mergers, the “Mergers”).\nThe Mergers were accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-50 — Business\nCombinations — Related Issues (“ASC Topic 805”), also referred to as “purchase accounting.” Under the asset acquisition\nmethod of accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also\nallocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. Per ASC Topic 805, assets\nare recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes transaction costs of the asset acquisition, and\nno gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the assets carrying\namounts on the acquiring entity’s books.\n87\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nImmediately following the acquisitions of AFT and AIF, the Company recorded its assets at their respective fair values. Since\nthe fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the merger consideration paid by the Company, the Company recognized a\ndeemed contribution from Investment Adviser. See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Mergers.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 enhances the disclosures required for reportable segments on an annual and interim\nbasis. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, for interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the\nimpact of this guidance.\nNote 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with AIM\nThe Company has an investment advisory management agreement with the Investment Adviser (the “Investment Advisory\nAgreement”) under which AIM receives a fee from the Company, consisting of two components — a base management fee and\na performance-based incentive fee.\nBase Management Fee\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% per quarter) of the Company's net asset value as\nof the final business day of the prior calendar quarter; provided, however, that the base management fee shall not be\ngreater than 1.50% (0.375% per quarter) of the lesser of (i) the average of the value of the Company's gross assets (excluding\ncash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently\ncompleted calendar quarters and (ii) the average monthly value (measured as of the last day of each month) of the Company's\ngross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) during the most\nrecently completed calendar quarter. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The value of the Company's gross\nassets is calculated in accordance with the Company's valuation procedures.\nFor the period from April 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022, the base management fee was calculated initially at an annual rate of\n1.50% (0.375% per quarter) of the lesser of (i) the average of the value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash\nequivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed\ncalendar quarters and (ii) the average monthly value (measured as of the last day of each month) of the Company’s gross assets\n(excluding cash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) during the most recently\ncompleted calendar quarter; provided, however, in each case, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.00%\n(0.250% per quarter) of the average of the value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including\nother assets purchased with borrowed amounts) that exceeds the product of (A) 200% and (B) the value of the Company’s net\nasset value at the end of the prior calendar quarter. The base management fee was payable quarterly in arrears. The value of the\nCompany’s gross assets was calculated in accordance with the Company's valuation procedures.\n88\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nPerformance-based Incentive Fee\nThe incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”) consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result\nthat one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is\nbased on capital gains, each as described below:\n(i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income - effective January 1, 2023\nThe Incentive Fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears by calculating the\namount by which (x) the aggregate amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect of the current calendar\nquarter and each of the eleven preceding calendar quarters (in either case, the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”) exceeds (y) the\npreferred return amount in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters; provided, however, that the pre-incentive fee net investment\nincome in respect of the current calendar quarter exceeds the multiple of (A) 1.75% and (B) the Company's net asset value at the\nbeginning of such calendar quarter. For the purposes of the Incentive Fee calculations, each calendar quarter comprising the\nrelevant Trailing Twelve Quarters that commenced prior to January 1, 2023 shall be known as a “Legacy Fee Quarter” while a\ncalendar quarter that commenced on or after January 1, 2023 shall be known as a “Current Fee Quarter.”\nThe preferred return amount is determined on a quarterly basis, and is calculated by summing the amounts obtained by multiplying\n1.75% by the Company’s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing\nTwelve Quarters. The preferred return amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company’s net asset\nvalue at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for Company capital issuances and distributions during the applicable\ncalendar quarter.\nThe amount of the Incentive Fee on Income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equals the excess of the\nincentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income, so calculated less the aggregate incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net\ninvestment income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters\ncomprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.\nThe Company will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in\neach calendar quarter as follows:\n(1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters\ndoes not exceed the preferred return amount.\n(2) 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the preferred\nreturn amount but is less than or equal to the catch-up amount, which shall be the sum of (i) the product of 2.1875% multiplied\nby the Company's net asset value at the beginning of each applicable Legacy Fee Quarter included in the relevant Trailing Twelve\nQuarters and (ii) the product of 2.1212% multiplied by the Company's net asset value at the beginning of each applicable Current\nFee Quarter included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.\n(3) for any quarter in which the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds\nthe catch-up amount, the incentive fee shall equal 20.00% for each Legacy Fee Quarter and 17.50% otherwise of the amount of\nthe Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, provided, however, that the incentive\nfee on income for any quarter shall not be greater than 20.00% or 17.50%, as applicable, of the amount of the Company's current\nquarter’s pre-incentive fee net investment income.\n89\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe Incentive Fee on Income as calculated is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap. The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount\nequal to (a) 20.00% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Legacy Fee Quarters\nincluded in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters and 17.50% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the relevant\nCurrent Fee Quarters included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees on Income that were\npaid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof)\ncomprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.\n(ii) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income - (January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2022)\nFor the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022, the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was\ndetermined and paid quarterly in arrears by calculating the amount by which (x) the aggregate amount of the pre-incentive fee\nnet investment income with respect of the applicable calendar quarter and each of the eleven preceding calendar quarters\nbeginning with the calendar quarter that commences on or after April 1, 2018 (the “trailing twelve quarters”) exceeds (y) the\npreferred return amount in respect of the trailing twelve quarters.\nThe preferred return amount was determined on a quarterly basis, and was calculated by summing the amounts obtained by\nmultiplying 1.75% by the Company’s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant\ntrailing twelve quarters. The preferred return amount was calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company’s net\nasset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for Company capital issuances and distributions during the\napplicable calendar quarter.\nThe amount of the Incentive Fee on Income that was paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equaled the excess\nof the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income, so calculated less the aggregate incentive fee on pre-incentive\nfee net investment income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar\nquarters comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.\nThe Company paid the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each\ncalendar quarter as follows:\n(1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters\ndid not exceed the preferred return amount.\n(2) 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters, if any, that exceeded the preferred return\namount but is less than or equal to an amount (the “catch-up amount”) determined by multiplying 2.1875% by the Company’s\nnet asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.\n(3) for any quarter in which the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters exceeded the\ncatch-up amount, the incentive fee should equal 20% of the amount of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income\nfor such trailing twelve quarters.\nThe Incentive Fee on Income as calculated was subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter\nwas an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant trailing\ntwelve quarters less (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees on Income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if\nany) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.\n90\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nFor this purpose, “Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return” during the relevant trailing twelve quarters means (x) Pre-Incentive\nFee Net Investment Income in respect of the trailing twelve quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, since April 1, 2018, in respect\nof the trailing twelve quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap was zero or a negative value, the Company shall pay no\nIncentive Fee on Income to the Investment Adviser in that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value\nbut is less than the Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the calculation described above, the Company shall\npay the Investment Adviser the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap was equal to or\ngreater than the Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the calculation described above, the Company shall pay\nthe Investment Adviser the Incentive Fee on Income for such quarter.\n“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether\nrealized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.\nB. Incentive Fee Based on Cumulative Net Realized Gains\nThe Incentive Fee on Capital Gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination\nof the investment advisory management agreement). This fee shall equal 17.50% of the sum of the Company’s realized capital\ngains on a cumulative basis, calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of investment advisory\nmanagement agreement), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis,\nless the aggregate amount of any Incentive Fees on Capital Gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser. The aggregate\nunrealized capital depreciation of the Company shall be calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the\nvaluation of each investment in the Company’s portfolio as of the applicable calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized\ncost basis of such investment.\nPrior to January 1, 2023, the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains was determined and paid in arrears as of the end of each calendar\nyear (or upon termination of the investment advisory management agreement). This fee equaled 20.0% of the sum of the\nCompany’s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis, calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of\ninvestment advisory management agreement), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on\na cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any Incentive Fees on Capital Gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser.\nThe aggregate unrealized capital depreciation of the Company was calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between\n(a) the valuation of each investment in the Company’s portfolio as of the applicable calculation date and (b) the accreted or\namortized cost basis of such investment.\nFor accounting purposes only, we are required under GAAP to accrue a theoretical capital gains incentive fee based upon net\nrealized capital gains and unrealized capital gain and loss on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual of this\ntheoretical capital gains incentive fee assumes all unrealized capital gain and loss is realized in order to reflect a theoretical capital\ngains incentive fee that would be payable to the Investment Adviser at each measurement date. There was no accrual for\ntheoretical capital gains incentive fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. It should be noted that\na fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) or the\ninvestment advisory management agreement, and would not be paid based upon such computation of capital gains incentive fees\nin subsequent periods. Amounts actually paid to the Investment Adviser will be consistent with the Advisers Act and formula\nreflected in the investment advisory management agreement which specifically excludes consideration of unrealized capital gain.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $4,428 and $13,203, respectively, of\nmanagement fees, and $4,601 and $16,212, respectively, of incentive fees before impact of waived fees. For the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized $4,374 and $12,972, respectively, of management fees, and $5,917\nand $18,233, respectively, of incentive fees before impact of waived fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, no management fees and no incentive fees were waived.\n91\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nAs of September 30, 2024 management and performance-based incentive fees payable were $4,428 and $4,601, respectively. As\nof December 31, 2023, management and performance-based incentive fees payable were $4,397 and $6,332, respectively.\nIn connection with the Mergers, the Company and the Investment Adviser agreed that, for purposes of incentive fee calculations\nunder the Investment Advisory Agreement, any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or purchase discount to\ninterest income or any gains or losses resulting solely from accounting adjustments to the cost basis of the assets beneficially\nowned by AFT and AIF assets acquired in the Mergers as required under applicable accounting guidance under ASC 805 will be\nexcluded.\nFee Offset\nOn January 16, 2019, the Company and AIM entered into a fee offset agreement in connection with revenue realized by AIM\nand its affiliates for the management of certain aircraft assets. the Company received an offsetting credit against total incentive\nfees otherwise due to AIM under the investment advisory management agreement. The amount offset was initially 20% of the\nmanagement fee revenue earned and incentive fee revenue realized by AIM and its affiliates in connection with managing aircraft\nassets on related insurance balance sheets (“New Balance Sheet Investments”), new aircraft managed account capital (“New\nManaged Accounts”) and new dedicated aircraft funds (“New Aircraft Funds”). Once the aggregate capital raised by the New\nAircraft Funds or New Managed Accounts and capital invested by the New Balance Sheet Investments exceeded $3 billion\ncumulatively, the fee offset would step down to 10% of the amount of incremental management fee revenue earned and incentive\nfee revenue realized by AIM and its affiliates. The fee offset was supposed to be in place for seven years, however the incentive\nfees realized by AIM and its affiliates after this seven-year period from applicable investments that were raised or made within\nthe seven-year period would also be used to offset incentive fees payable to AIM by the Company. The offset would be limited\nto the amount of incentive fee payable by the Company to AIM and any unapplied fee offset which exceeds the incentive fees\npayable in a given quarter will carry forward to be credited against the incentive fees payable by the Company in subsequent\nquarters.\nEffective February 21, 2023, as a result of the planned reduction and the pending departure of certain Merx personnel, Merx and\nApollo agreed to terminate the fee offset agreement in exchange for a termination fee of $7.5 million.\nThere was no management fee and performance based fee offset for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively.

Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only in accordance with the terms of the\nexemptive order we received from the SEC permitting us to do so. On December 29, 2021, we received an exemptive order from\nthe SEC, which was amended on January 10, 2023 (the “Order”) permitting us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-\ninvestment transactions with certain of our affiliates, including investment funds managed by AIM or its affiliates and Apollo\nproprietary accounts, subject to the conditions included therein. Under the terms of the Order, a “required majority” (as defined\nin Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must be able to reach certain conclusions in connection with a co-\ninvestment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders\nand do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent\nwith the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our Board’s approved criteria. In certain situations where co-\ninvestment with one or more funds managed by AIM or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, the personnel of AIM or its\naffiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based\non allocation policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly\nand equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The\nOrder is subject to certain terms and conditions so there can be no assurance that we will be permitted to co-invest with certain\nof our affiliates other than in the circumstances currently permitted by regulatory guidance and the Order.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s co-investment holdings were 77% of the portfolio or $2,319,815, measured at fair\nvalue. On a cost basis, 72% of the portfolio or $2,337,905 were co-investments. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s co-\ninvestment holdings were 77% of the portfolio or $1,808,017, measured at fair value. On a cost basis, 72% of the portfolio or\n$1,817,084 were co-investments.\n93\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nMerx Aviation\nEffective January 16, 2019, Merx entered into a series of service arrangements with affiliates of AGM.

For the commodity price unobservable input, the weighted average price is an undiscounted price\nbased upon the estimated production level from the underlying reserves.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s debt and equity securities are primarily\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) comparable multiples and market discount rates. The\nCompany typically uses EBITDA comparable multiples on its equity securities to determine the fair value of investments. The\nCompany uses market discount rates for debt securities to determine if the effective yield on a debt security is commensurate\nwith the market yields for that type of debt security. If a debt security’s effective yield is significantly less than the market yield\nfor a similar debt security with a similar credit profile, the resulting fair value of the debt security may be lower. For certain\ninvestments where fair value is derived based on a recovery analysis, the Company uses underlying commodity prices from third\nparty market pricing services to determine the fair value and/or recoverable amount, which represents the proceeds expected to\nbe collected through asset sales or liquidation. Further, for certain investments, the Company also considered the probability of\nfuture events which are not in management’s control. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation would\nresult in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of the structured products include the discount rate applied in the valuation models in addition to default and\nrecovery rates applied to projected cash flows in the valuation models. Specifically, when a discounted cash flow model is used\nto determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected\ncash flows. Increases in the discount rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment; conversely decreases in the\ndiscount rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates\nan investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks. For certain investments such as warrants, the Company may\nuse an option pricing technique, of which the applicable method is the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method (“BSM”), to perform\nvaluations. The BSM is a model of price variation over time of financial instruments, such as equity, that is used to determine the\nprice of call or put options.

The amended and restated\nagreement extended the final maturity date through April 19, 2028.

The total\nlender commitments will remain $1,705,000 until December 22, 2024 and will decrease to $1,550,000 thereafter. The Senior\nSecured Facility includes an “accordion” feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Facility to $2,325,000. The\nSenior Secured Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets in the Company’s portfolio, including cash and cash\nequivalents.\nCommencing April 19, 2027, the Company is required to repay, in twelve consecutive monthly installments of equal size, the\noutstanding amount under the Senior Secured Facility as of April 19, 2027. The stated interest rates on outstanding borrowings\nunder the Senior Secured Facility depend on the type of borrowing and the “gross borrowing base” at the time. USD borrowings\naccrue at (a) either Term SOFR plus 1.85% per annum or Term SOFR plus 1.975% per annum, or (b) either Alternate Base Rate\nplus 0.75% per annum or Alternate Base Rate plus 0.875% per annum.

In\naddition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Senior Secured Facility\n(and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance\nrates to different types of assets in the Company’s portfolio. The advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the\nCompany’s portfolio will also depend on the relevant asset coverage ratio as of the date of determination. Borrowings under the\nSenior Secured Facility will also continue to be subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act.\nThe Senior Secured Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $150,000. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $15,782 and $17,291, respectively, in standby letters of credit\nissued through the Senior Secured Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Senior Secured Facility is reduced by\nany standby letters of credit issued through the Senior Secured Facility. Under GAAP, these letters of credit are considered\ncommitments because no funding has been made and as such are not considered a liability. These letters of credit are not senior\nsecurities because they are not in the form of a typical financial guarantee and the portfolio companies are obligated to refund\nany drawn amounts. The available remaining capacity under the Senior Secured Facility was $697,309 and $1,004,732 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company has various commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans,\nincluding commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had the following unfunded commitments to its portfolio companies:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnfunded revolver obligations and bridge loan commitments (1) $ 212,758 $ 139,979\nStandby letters of credit issued and outstanding (2) 20,911 42,921\nUnfunded delayed draw loan commitments (including commitments with performance thresholds\nnot met) (3) 243,013 167,756\nTotal Unfunded Commitments (4) $ 476,682 $ 350,656\n(1) The unfunded revolver obligations may or may not be funded to the borrowing party in the future. The amounts relate to loans with various\nmaturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, subject\nto the terms of each loan’s respective credit agreements which includes borrowing covenants that need to be met prior to funding. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the bridge loan commitments included in the balances were $0 and $0, respectively.\n(2) For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, the Company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio\ncompanies were to default on their related payment obligations. None of the letters of credit issued and outstanding are recorded as a\nliability on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the\ninvestments in the portfolio company.\n(3) The Company’s commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions\nwhich can include covenants to maintain specified leverage levels and other related borrowing base covenants. For commitments to fund\ndelayed draw loans with performance thresholds, borrowers are required to meet certain performance requirements before the Company\nis obligated to fulfill these commitments.\n(4) The Company also had an unfunded revolver commitment to its fully controlled affiliate Merx Aviation Finance, LLC of $40,425 and\n$25,925 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Given the Company’s controlling interest, the timing and the\namount of the funding has not been determined.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business.\nOn March 14, 2023, certain First Lien and Second Lien holders of debt issued by Mitel filed a complaint in New York State Court\ncaptioned Ocean Trails CLO VII et al v. MLN TopCo Ltd., et al, Index No. 651327/2023, against certain other First Lien and\nSecond Lien debt holders, including AFT and AIF, alleging, among other things, that the defendant lenders breached the terms\nof their lending agreements and the New York Uniform Voidable Transfer Act in connection with certain amendments to the\nrelevant documents governing the debt. Plaintiffs seek to have the amendments in question declared void. On December 5, 2023,\nthe trial court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss in part and denied them in part. The trial matter is currently in discovery.\nThe plaintiffs and defendants have also taken interlocutory appeals of the courts’ motion to dismiss ruling to the intermediate\nNew York State appellate court, which are pending. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time.\nManagement is not aware of any pending or threatened material litigation as of September 30, 2024 other than the matter disclosed\nabove.\n108\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nNote 9.

For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, the annualized ratio of operating expenses to average net assets and the annualized ratio of total expenses to average net assets would\nbe 4.70% and 14.95%, respectively, without the voluntary fee waivers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the annualized\nratio of operating expenses to average net assets and the annualized ratio of total expenses to average net assets would be 5.75% and\n16.13%, respectively, without the voluntary fee waivers.\n(5) Annualized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(6) The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our total assets, less all liabilities and\nindebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by senior securities representing indebtedness. This asset coverage ratio is\nmultiplied by one thousand to determine the asset coverage per unit. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's asset coverage was 180%.\n(7) Includes investments acquired from the Mergers.\nNote 10. Mergers with AFT and AIF\nOn July 22, 2024, the Company completed its mergers with AFT and AIF. Pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement, AFT Merger\nSub was first merged with and into AFT, with AFT continuing as the surviving company, and, following the effectiveness of the\nAFT First Merger, AFT was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company.\nIn accordance with the terms of the AFT Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the AFT First Merger, each outstanding\nshare of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AFT was converted into the right to receive 0.9547 shares of common\nstock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (with AFT stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the\nCompany). Pursuant to the AIF Merger Agreement, AIF Merger Sub was first merged with and into AIF, with AIF continuing as\nthe surviving company, and, following the effectiveness of the AIF First Merger, AIF was then merged with and into the\nCompany, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the AIF Merger Agreement,\nat the effective time of the AIF First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AIF was\nconverted into the right to receive 0.9441 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (with AIF\nstockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). As a result of the Mergers, the Company issued an\naggregate of 28,527,003 shares of its common stock to former AFT and AIF stockholders.\nThe Mergers were considered asset acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles with the Company being the\naccounting survivor. The Mergers were accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting by the Company in\naccordance with ASC 805. Under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost\nof the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up\nthe group. Per ASC 805-50-30-1, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes\ntransaction costs of the asset acquisition, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of noncash assets given as\nconsideration differs from the assets’ carrying amounts on the acquiring entity’s records. ASC 805-50-30-2 provides that asset\nacquisitions in which the consideration given is cash are measured by the amount of cash paid. However, if the consideration\ngiven is not in the form of cash (that is, in the form of noncash assets, liabilities incurred, or equity interests issued), measurement\nis based on the cost to the acquiring entity or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident\nand, thus, more reliably measured.\nThe Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former AFT and AIF\nstockholders pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement and AIF Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration\npaid in connection with the Mergers under ASC 805. The consideration paid to AFT and AIF stockholders was less than the\naggregate fair values of the AFT and AIF assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the\n“purchase discount”). Since the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the merger consideration paid by the Company, the\nCompany recognized a deemed contribution from Investment Adviser.\n110\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe Mergers were considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has carried forward the historical adjusted tax cost of\nAFT and AIF investments for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Mergers:\nAFT AIF AFT / AIF\nCommon stock issued by the Company1 $ 228,076 $ 209,529 $ 437,605\nDeemed contribution from the Investment Advisor 1,313 1,222 2,535\nTotal Purchase Consideration $ 229,389 $ 210,751 $ 440,140\nAssets Acquired:\nInvestments, at fair value $ 310,795 $ 285,092 $ 595,887\nCash & Cash Equivalent2 2,699 7,232 9,931\nOther Assets 7,592 8,506 16,098\nTotal Assets Acquired $ 321,086 $ 300,830 $ 621,916\nLiabilities Assumed3,4 (91,697) (90,079) (181,776)\nNet Assets Acquired $ 229,389 $ 210,751 $ 440,140\n(1) Based on the Company's closing market price on July 19, 2024 of $15.34 and 28,527,003 shares of common stock issued by the Company\nin conjunction with the Mergers. The Company paid $1 to stockholders in cash in lieu of fractional shares resulting from the Mergers.\n(2) Includes $2 and $2 foreign cash and cash equivalents for AFT and AIF, respectively.\n(3) Includes $207 and $191 management fee accrued through the closing date of the Mergers pursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween AFT and AIF and an affiliate of the Investment Adviser respectively, which was terminated upon the closing of the Mergers. The\npayable for these fees was assumed by the Company and paid by the Company to the affiliate of the Investment Adviser in August 2024.\n(4) On July 22, 2024, the Company paid down outstanding debt obligations of AFT and AIF totaling $177 million.\nNote 11. Subsequent Events\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of these financial statements and has determined that\nthere are no subsequent events outside the ordinary scope of business that require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated\nfinancial statements other than those disclosed below.\nDistribution Declarations\nOn November 6, 2024, the Company’s Board declared a base distribution of $0.38 per share, payable on December 26, 2024 to\nstockholders of record as of December 10, 2024. There can be no assurances that the Board will continue to declare a base\ndistribution of $0.38 per share.\nAmended Senior Secured Facility\nOn October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended the Senior Secured Facility (the \"Amended Senior Secured Facility\").\nLender commitments under the Amended Senior Secured Facility will increase from $1.705 billion to $1.815 billion until\nDecember 22, 2024 and will decrease to $1.660 billion thereafter. The Amended Senior Secured Facility includes an “accordion”\nfeature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Facility to $2.723 billion.\n111\nMIDCAP FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe final maturity date under the Amended Senior Secured Facility for extending lenders was extended by over a year from April\n19, 2028 to October 17, 2029. The covenants and representations and warranties the Company is required to comply with were\nalso modified (including, among other things, that the minimum stockholders’ equity test was reset), but the remaining material\nbusiness terms and conditions of the Amended Senior Secured Facility remain substantially the same. The Amended Senior\nSecured Facility continues to include usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this\ntype.\nBorrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue to be subject\nto compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company’s portfolio.\nThe advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the Company’s portfolio depends on the relevant asset coverage ratio\nas of the date of determination. Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility continue to be subject to the leverage\nrestrictions contained in the 1940 Act. Terms used in this disclosure have the meanings set forth in the Amended Senior Secured\nFacility.\n112\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and Board of Directors of MidCap Financial Investment Corporation\nResults of Review of Interim Financial Information\nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of\ninvestments, of MidCap Financial Investment Corporation (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations and changes in net assets for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows and the financial highlights for the nine-month periods ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"interim financial information\"). Based on our reviews, we\nare not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows\nfor the year then ended (not presented herein), and the financial highlights for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in\nour report dated February 26, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our\nopinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated\nschedule of investments, as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement\nof assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, from which it has been derived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists\nprincipally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.\nIt is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which\nis the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an\nopinion.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nNovember 7, 2024\n113\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial\nstatements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Some of the statements in this report constitute forward-\nlooking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements\ncontained herein involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\n• our future operating results;\n• our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;\n• the impact of investments that we expect to make;\n• our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;\n• the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;\n• the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;\n• our expected financings and investments;\n• the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital;\n• the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies;\n• the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers (as defined below);\n• the effects of disruption on our business from the Mergers; and\n• the combined company’s plans, expectations, objectives and intentions as a result of the Mergers.\nWe generally use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions to identify forward-\nlooking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any\nreason, including any factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report,\nand we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or\nupdate any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to\nconsult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including any annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K.\n114\nOverview\nMidCap Financial Investment Corporation (the “Company,” “MFIC,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated under the Maryland\nGeneral Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements.\nFor instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private or\nthinly traded public U.S. companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature\nin one year or less. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company\n(“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Pursuant to this election and\nassuming we qualify as a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income we distribute\nto our stockholders. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon completion of our initial public offering that raised $870\nmillion in net proceeds from selling 62 million shares of common stock at a price of $15.00 per share (20.7 million shares at a\nprice of $45.00 per share adjusted for the one-for-three reverse stock split). Since then, and through September 30, 2024, we have\nraised approximately $2.68 billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and we have repurchased common\nstock for $248.1 million.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Company changed its name from “Apollo Investment Corporation” to “MidCap Financial Investment\nCorporation.” Our common stock began to trade under the ticker “MFIC” on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market on August 12,\n2022.\nApollo Investment Management, L.P. (the “Investment Adviser” or “AIM”) is our investment adviser and an affiliate of Apollo\nGlobal Management, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“AGM”). The Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision\nof our Board of Directors (the “Board”) , manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to the\nCompany. AGM and other affiliates manage other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part,\nwith ours. AIM and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more of those other\nfunds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, AIM may determine that we\nshould invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We make all such investments subject to compliance with\napplicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made\nonly in accordance with the terms of the exemptive order (the “Order”) we received from the SEC permitting us to do so. Under\nthe terms of the Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must be\nable to reach certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed\ntransaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the\npart of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our\nBoard’s approved criteria. In certain situations where co-investment with one or more funds managed by AIM or its affiliates is\nnot covered by the Order, the personnel of AIM or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment.\nSuch personnel will make these determinations based on allocation policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably\nensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is\nconsistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Order is subject to certain terms and conditions so there can be no\nassurance that we will be permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates other than in the circumstances currently permitted\nby regulatory guidance and the Order.\n115\nApollo Investment Administration, LLC (the “Administrator” or “AIA”), an affiliate of AGM, provides, among other things,\nadministrative services and facilities for the Company. In addition to furnishing us with office facilities, equipment, and clerical,\nbookkeeping and recordkeeping services, AIA also oversees our financial records as well as prepares our reports to stockholders\nand reports filed with the SEC. AIA also performs the calculation and publication of our net asset value, the payment of our\nexpenses and oversees the performance of various third-party service providers and the preparation and filing of our tax returns.\nFurthermore, AIA provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide\nsuch assistance.\nOn July 22, 2024, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the\n“AFT Merger Agreement”) with Apollo Senior Floating Rate Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation (“AFT”), AFT Merger Sub,\nInc., a Maryland corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“AFT Merger Sub”), and, solely for the\nlimited purposes set forth therein, the Investment Adviser, and (ii) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “AIF Merger\nAgreement” and, together with the AFT Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”) with Apollo Tactical Income Fund Inc.,\na Maryland corporation (“AIF”), AIF Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the\nCompany (“AIF Merger Sub”), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Investment Adviser. In connection\ntherewith, AFT and AIF merged with an into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. For more\ninformation on the Mergers, please see Note 10 \"Mergers with AFT and AIF\" to our consolidated financial statements included\nin this report.\nInvestments\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We primarily invest\nin directly originated and privately negotiated first lien senior secured loans to privately held U.S. middle-market companies,\nwhich the Company generally defines as companies with less than $75 million in EBITDA, as may be adjusted for market\ndisruptions, mergers and acquisitions-related charges and synergies, and other items. To a lesser extent, we may invest in other\ntypes of securities including, first lien unitranche, second lien senior secured, unsecured, subordinated, and mezzanine loans, and\nequities in both private and public middle market companies.\nOur level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the\namount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such\ncompanies, the general economic environment, the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. As a BDC,\nwe must not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made,\nat least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). As of September 30, 2024, non-qualifying\nassets represented approximately 8.3% of the total assets of the Company.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains, if any,\non investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of mezzanine or\nsenior secured loans, generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually\ndetermined on the basis of a benchmark, such as SOFR, the federal funds rate, or the prime rate. Interest on debt securities is\ngenerally payable quarterly or semiannually and while U.S. subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at\nfixed rates, some of our investments may include zero coupon and/or step-up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call\nor maturity basis. In addition, some of our investments provide for payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. Such amounts\nof accrued PIK interest or dividends are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally\nbecome due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. We may also generate revenue in the\nform of commitment, origination, structuring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees,\netc.\n116\nExpenses\nFor all investment professionals of AIM and their staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and\nmanagement services to us, the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services\nare provided and paid for by AIM. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those\nrelating to:\n• investment advisory and management fees;\n• expenses incurred by AIM payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring our\nfinancial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio\ncompanies;\n• calculation of our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n• direct costs and expenses of administration, including independent registered public accounting and legal costs;\n• costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC;\n• interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;\n• offerings of our common stock and other securities;\n• registration and listing fees;\n• fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating\nand making investments;\n• transfer agent and custodial fees;\n• taxes;\n• independent directors’ fees and expenses;\n• marketing and distribution-related expenses;\n• the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing and postage costs;\n• our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other\ninsurance premiums;\n• organizational costs; and\n• all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as our\nallocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost\nof our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs.\nWe expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar\nterms. During periods of asset growth, we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a\npercentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to\nfuture offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio\nperformance, interest rate benchmarks, and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods, among other factors.\n117\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nOur portfolio and investment activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was as follows:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n(in millions)* 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestments made in portfolio companies(1) $ 911.9 $ 30.3 $ 1,310.1 $ 283.0\nInvestments sold(1) (188.5) — (188.5) —\nNet activity before repaid investments(1) 723.4 30.3 1,121.6 283.0\nInvestments repaid(1) (138.8) (72.9) (430.6) (323.7)\nNet investment activity(1) $ 584.6 $ (42.6) $ 691.0 $ (40.7)\nPortfolio companies, at beginning of period 165 150 152 135\nNumber of investments in new portfolio\ncompanies(1) 131 2 156 22\nNumber of exited companies(1) (46) (3) (58) (8)\nPortfolio companies at end of period(1) 250 149 250 149\nNumber of investments in existing portfolio\ncompanies 60 32 97 68\n* Totals may not foot due to rounding.\n(1) Includes investments acquired from the Mergers.\n118\nOur portfolio composition and weighted average yields as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPortfolio composition, at fair value:\nFirst lien secured debt 91% 89%\nSecond lien secured debt 1% 1%\nTotal secured debt 92% 90%\nUnsecured debt 0% —%\nStructured products and other 2% 2%\nPreferred equity 1% 1%\nCommon equity/interests and warrants 5% 7%\nWeighted average yields, at amortized cost (1):\nFirst lien secured debt (2) 11.1% 12.1%\nSecond lien secured debt (2) 14.0% 13.7%\nSecured debt portfolio (2) 11.1% 12.1%\nUnsecured debt portfolio (2) 9.5% —%\nTotal debt portfolio (2) 11.1% 12.1%\nTotal portfolio (3) 9.6% 10.1%\nInterest rate type, at fair value (4):\nFixed rate amount $ 0.0 billion $ 0.0 billion\nFloating rate amount $ 2.7 billion $ 2.0 billion\nFixed rate, as percentage of total 1 % 0 %\nFloating rate, as percentage of total 99 % 100 %\nInterest rate type, at amortized cost (4):\nFixed rate amount $ 0.0 billion $ 0.0 billion\nFloating rate amount $ 2.7 billion $ 2.0 billion\nFixed rate, as percentage of total 1 % 0 %\nFloating rate, as percentage of total 99 % 100 %\n(1) An investor’s yield may be lower than the portfolio yield due to sales loads and other expenses.\n(2) Exclusive of investments on non-accrual status.\n(3) Inclusive of all income generating investments, non-income generating investments and investments on non-accrual status.\n(4) The interest rate type information is calculated using the Company's corporate debt portfolio and excludes aviation and investments on\nnon-accrual status.\nSince the initial public offering of the Company in April 2004 and through September 30, 2024, invested capital totaled $25.2\nbillion in 783 portfolio companies. Over the same period, the Company completed transactions with more than 100 different\nfinancial sponsors.\n119\nRecent Developments\nOn October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended its senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility (the\n\"Amended Senior Secured Facility\"). Lender commitments under the Amended Senior Secured Facility will increase from $1.705\nbillion to $1.815 billion until December 22, 2024 and will decrease to $1.660 billion thereafter. The Amended Senior Secured\nFacility includes an “accordion” feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Facility to $2.723 billion.\nThe final maturity date under the Amended Senior Secured Facility for extending lenders was extended by over a year from April\n19, 2028 to October 17, 2029. The covenants and representations and warranties the Company is required to comply with were\nalso modified (including, among other things, that the minimum stockholders’ equity test was reset), but the remaining material\nbusiness terms and conditions of the Amended Senior Secured Facility remain substantially the same. The Amended Senior\nSecured Facility continues to include usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this\ntype.\nBorrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue to be subject\nto compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company’s portfolio.\nThe advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the Company’s portfolio depends on the relevant asset coverage ratio\nas of the date of determination. Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility continue to be subject to the leverage\nrestrictions contained in the 1940 Act. Terms used in this disclosure have the meanings set forth in the Amended Senior Secured\nFacility.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The\npreparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, credit\nworthiness of portfolio companies and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially. In addition to the discussion below, our significant accounting policies are further described in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), where fair value is defined as the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value measurements are determined within a framework that establishes a three-tier hierarchy which\nmaximizes the use of observable market data and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to establish a classification of fair\nvalue measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure\nfair value using a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs for the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or\nunobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on\nmarket data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions\nabout the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the information available. The\ninputs or methodology used for valuing assets or liabilities may not be an indication of the risks associated with investing in those\nassets or liabilities.\n120\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined\nbased on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a\nparticular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nThe level assigned to the investment valuations may not be indicative of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in such\ninvestments. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the consolidated financial statements may\ndiffer materially from the values that would be received upon an actual disposition of such investments.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $2.83 billion or 93.6% of the Company’s investments were classified as Level 3. The high proportion\nof Level 3 investments relative to our total investments is directly related to our investment philosophy and target portfolio, which\nconsists primarily of long-term secured debt, as well as unsecured and mezzanine positions of private middle-market companies.\nA fundamental difference exists between our investments and those of comparable publicly traded fixed income investments,\nnamely high-yield bonds, and this difference affects the valuation of our private investments relative to comparable publicly\ntraded instruments.\nSenior secured loans, or senior loans, are higher in the capital structure than high-yield bonds, and are typically secured by assets\nof the borrowing company. This improves their recovery prospects in the event of default and affords senior loans a structural\nadvantage over high-yield bonds. Many of the Company’s investments are also privately negotiated and contain covenant\nprotections that limit the issuer to take actions that could harm us as a creditor. High-yield bonds typically do not contain such\ncovenants.\nGiven the structural advantages of capital seniority and covenant protection, the valuation of our private debt portfolio is driven\nmore by investment specific credit factors than movements in the broader debt capital markets. Each security is evaluated\nindividually and as indicated below, we value our private investments based upon a multi-step valuation process, including\nvaluation recommendations from independent valuation firms.\n121\nInvestment Valuation Process\nPursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Company’s Board has designated the Investment Adviser as its “valuation\ndesignee” to perform the fair value determinations for all investments held by the Company. The Company's Board continues to\nbe responsible for overseeing the processes for determining fair valuation.\nUnder the Company's valuation policies and procedures, the Investment Adviser values investments, including certain secured\ndebt, unsecured debt, and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily\navailable, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). We attempt to obtain market quotations\nfrom at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker, primary market dealer or other\nindependent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within\nthe range is more representative. If and when market quotations are unavailable or are deemed not to represent fair value, we\ntypically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go\nthrough our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each case, our independent third party valuation firms consider\nobservable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such\ninvestments. Investments purchased within the quarter before the valuation date and debt investments with remaining maturities\nof 60 days or less may each be valued at cost with interest accrued or discount accreted/premium amortized to the date of maturity\n(although they are typically valued at available market quotations), unless such valuation, in the judgment of our Investment\nAdviser, does not represent fair value. In this case, such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by\nor under the direction of the Investment Adviser, including using market quotations where available. Investments that are not\npublicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or\nunder the direction of the Investment Adviser. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed\nnot to represent fair value, our Investment Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n1. Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by using certain\ninputs provided, among others, by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser who are responsible for the\nportfolio investment.\n2. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our Investment\nAdviser.\n3. The Investment Adviser discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in our\nportfolio based on the input of the applicable independent valuation firm.\n4. For Level 3 investments entered into within the current quarter, the cost (purchase price adjusted for accreted original\nissue discount/amortized premium) or any recent comparable trade activity on the security investment shall be\nconsidered to reasonably approximate the fair value of the investment, provided that no material change has since\noccurred in the issuer’s business, significant inputs or the relevant environment.\nInvestments determined by these valuation procedures which have a fair value of less than $1 million during the prior fiscal\nquarter may be valued based on inputs identified by the Investment Adviser without the necessity of obtaining valuation from an\nindependent valuation firm, if once annually an independent valuation firm using the procedures described herein provides an\nindependent assessment of value.\n122\nInvestments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate.\nThe market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or\ncomparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts\n(for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated\nby current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take\ninto account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and\napplicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, seniority of\ninvestment in the investee company’s capital structure, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable\nvalue of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in\nwhich the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&A comparables,\nour principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When readily available, broker quotations\nand/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the Company’s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in\nthe valuation process.\nBecause there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio\ninvestments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, as described\nherein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market\nvalue, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may\ndiffer significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market existed for such investments and may differ\nmaterially from the values that we may ultimately realize.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the\ngains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the\nvaluations currently assigned.\n123\nResults of Operations\nOperating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions)* 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment Income\nInterest income $ 77.4 $ 66.7 $ 207.5 $ 198.1\nDividend income 0.7 0.7 1.0 0.9\nPIK interest income 3.0 0.5 7.5 2.1\nOther income 1.0 0.3 3.6 3.5\nTotal investment income $ 82.1 $ 68.2 $ 219.6 $ 204.6\nExpenses\nManagement and performance-based incentive fees, net\n$ 9.0 $ 10.3 $ 29.4 $ 30.9\nof amounts waived\nInterest and other debt expenses, net of reimbursements 31.8 25.9 84.7 76.2\nAdministrative services expense, net of reimbursements 1.0 1.5 2.9 4.2\nOther general and administrative expenses 2.2 2.5 6.5 7.0\nNet Expenses $ 44.0 $ 40.3 $ 123.4 $ 118.3\nNet Investment Income $ 38.1 $ 27.9 $ 96.2 $ 86.2\nNet Realized and Change in Unrealized Gains\n(Losses)\nNet realized gains (losses) $ 0.5 $ (0.2) $ (23.2) $ (1.2)\nNet change in unrealized gains (losses) (11.9) 2.3 1.8 0.5\nNet Realized and Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) $ (11.4) $ 2.1 $ (21.5) $ (0.7)\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations $ 26.7 $ 30.0 $ 74.8 $ 85.5\nNet Investment Income on Per Average Share Basis (1) $ 0.44 $ 0.43 $ 1.32 $ 1.32\nEarnings per share — basic (1) $ 0.31 $ 0.46 $ 1.03 $ 1.31\n* Totals may not foot due to rounding.\n(1) Based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period presented.\nTotal Investment Income\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nThe increase in total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increase in interest income (including PIK) of $13.2 million. The increase in total\ninterest income was due to a higher income-bearing investment portfolio, primarily related to the assets acquired in the mergers\nwith AFT and AIF. This was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield for the total debt portfolio, from 12.0% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 to 11.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Further, there was also an\nincrease in other income of $0.7 million due to higher amendment fees.\n124\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nThe increase in total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increase in interest income (including PIK) of $14.8 million. The increase in total\ninterest income was due to a higher income-bearing investment portfolio, partially related to the assets acquired in the mergers\nwith AFT and AIF. Additionally, prepayment fees and income recognized from the acceleration of discount, premium, or deferred\nfees on repaid investments increased from $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $6.2 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet Expenses\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nNet expenses increased by $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, primarily driven by the increase in interest and other debt expenses of $5.9 million. The increase in interest\nand other debt expenses was attributed to an increase in average debt outstanding, from $1.44 billion for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to $1.72 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Further, there was an increase in the total\nannualized cost of debt, from 7.16% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.35% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. This was partially offset by the decrease of $1.3 million in performance-based incentive fees.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nNet expenses increased by $5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, primarily driven by the increase in interest and other debt expenses of $8.5 million. The increase in interest\nand other debt expenses was attributed to an increase in average debt outstanding, from $1.45 billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to $1.51 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Further, there was an increase in the total\nannualized cost of debt, from 7.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.47% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024. This was partially offset by the decrease of $1.6 million in management and performance-based incentive fees (net of\namounts waived) due to a decrease in performance based incentive fees.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gross realized gains of $1.3 million and gross realized losses\nof $0.8 million, resulting in net realized gains of $0.5 million. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nwere due to a collection of minor individual losses from several portfolio companies and offset by realized gain from sale of\nSoliant.

(1.2)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt\nofferings, our Senior Secured Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), our senior secured notes,\nour senior unsecured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-\nrecourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and repayments of senior and\nsubordinated loans and income earned from investments.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our short-term investments, proceeds from the sale of our 2025\nNotes, 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes and Bethesda CLO 1, our available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Facility and\nour anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next\ntwelve months.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and near their\nmaturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities\nwith a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company deems\nthat certain money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities\nwould qualify as cash equivalents (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) At the end of each fiscal quarter, we\nconsider taking proactive steps utilizing cash equivalents with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility during the\nfollowing quarter, pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills from time-to-\ntime on the last business day of the quarter and typically close out that position on the following business day, settling the sale\ntransaction on a net cash basis with the purchase, subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements\nor other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on our Senior Secured Facility, as we deem appropriate.\nDebt\nSee Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company’s debt.\n128\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2024:\nPayments Due by Period\nMore than 5\n(in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years Years\nSenior Secured Facility (1) $ 991.9 $ — $ — $ 991.9 $ —\n2025 Notes 350.0 350.0 — — —\n2026 Notes 125.0 — 125.0 — —\n2028 Notes 80.0 — — 80.0 —\nBethesda CLO 1 Class A-1 232.0 — — — 232.0\nTotal Debt Obligations $ 1,778.9 $ 350.0 $ 125.0 $ 1,071.9 $ 232.0\n____________________\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, aggregate lender commitments under the Senior Secured Facility totaled $1.71 billion and $697.3 million of\nunused capacity. As of September 30, 2024, there were $16.0 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior Secured Facility as shown\nas part of total commitments in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nStockholders’ Equity\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company’s public offerings and share repurchase\nplans.\nEquity Issuances\nWe may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock through public or at-the-market (\"ATM”) offerings. On\nAugust 13, 2024, we entered into (i) an equity distribution agreement by and among us, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator\nand Truist Securities, Inc. (“Truist”) and (ii) an equity distribution agreement by and among us, the Investment Adviser, the\nAdministrator and Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies,” and together with Truist, the “Sales Agents”). The equity distribution agreements\nwith Sales Agents described in the preceding sentence are collectively referred to herein as the “Equity Distribution Agreements.”\nFor further details regarding the Equity Distribution Agreements, see Note 7 \"Stockholders’ Equity—Equity Issuances — At-\nthe-market (“ATM”) Offering” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nDistributions\nDistributions paid to stockholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $54.4 million ($0.58 per\nshare) and $104.0 million ($1.34 per share) which includes $18.8 million special distribution ($0.20 per share), respectively.\nDistributions paid to stockholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $24.8 million ($0.38 per\nshare) and $74.5 million ($1.14 per share), respectively. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported\nas ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. Although the tax character of\ndistributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include return of capital, the exact amount cannot be\ndetermined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until we file our tax return\nfor the tax year ended December 31, 2024. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099\nafter the end of the calendar year. Our quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board.\nTo maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in\nexcess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. Although we currently\nintend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at\nleast annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains\n129\nfor investment. Currently, we have substantial net capital loss carryforwards and consequently do not expect to generate\ncumulative net capital gains in the foreseeable future.\nWe maintain an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then\nstockholders’ cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically\n“opt out” of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the\namount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may in\nthe future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare\ndividends if we default under certain provisions or fail to satisfy certain other conditions. If we do not distribute a certain\npercentage of our income annually, we may suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available\nto us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have\nnot yet received in cash, such as contractual PIK, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes\ndue at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or\nwithout receiving cash representing such income, we may not be able to meet the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our\ninvestment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC.\nWith respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront\nfees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders.\nPIK Income\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, PIK income totaled $3.0 million and $7.5 million on total investment\nincome of $82.1 million and $219.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, PIK income\ntotaled $0.5 million and $2.1 million on total investment income of $68.2 million and $204.6 million, respectively. In order to\nmaintain the Company’s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form\nof distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for\nmore information on the Company’s PIK income.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company’s related party transactions.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio.\nInvestment valuation risk\nBecause there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value all of our portfolio\ninvestments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board based on, among other things, the input of our management\nand audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our Board to assist in the valuation\nof each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent\nuncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our\ninvestments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the\nvalues that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that\nwe may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise\nare less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation\nsale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market\nenvironment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on\n130\nthese investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” and\n“—Fair Value Measurements” as well as Notes 2 and 5 to our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 for more information relating to our investment valuation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we\nfund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at\nwhich we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market\ninterest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the majority of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which generally are\nSOFR-based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate) and typically have durations of one to six months after which\nthey reset to current market interest rates, and many of which are subject to certain floors. Further, our Senior Secured Facility\nand Class A-1 Notes under the CLO bears interest at SOFR rates with no interest rate floors, while our 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes\nand 2028 Notes bears interest at a fixed rate.\nWe regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an\nongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we\ndetermine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe following table shows the estimated annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates\n(considering interest rate flows for variable rate instruments) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024,\nassuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:\nNet Investment Net Investment Income\nBasis Point Change Income Per Share\nUp 150 basis points $ 18.4 million $ 0.196\nUp 100 basis points 12.3 million 0.131\nUp 50 basis points 6.1 million 0.065\nDown 50 basis points (6.1) million (0.065)\nDown 100 basis points (12.1) million (0.129)\nDown 150 basis points (18.1) million (0.193)\nWe may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options\nand forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities\nmay insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower\ninterest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments.\n131\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such\npossible controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement has not identified any change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n132\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of our business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our\nportfolio companies. While we do not expect that the resolution of these matters if they arise would materially affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations, resolution will be subject to various uncertainties and could result in the expenditure\nof significant financial and managerial resources.\nOn March 14, 2023, certain First Lien and Second Lien holders of debt issued by Mitel filed a complaint in New York State Court\ncaptioned Ocean Trails CLO VII et al v. MLN TopCo Ltd., et al, Index No. 651327/2023, against certain other First Lien and\nSecond Lien debt holders, including AFT and AIF, alleging, among other things, that the defendant lenders breached the terms\nof their lending agreements and the New York Uniform Voidable Transfer Act in connection with certain amendments to the\nrelevant documents governing the debt. Plaintiffs seek to have the amendments in question declared void. On December 5, 2023,\nthe trial court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss in part and denied them in part. The trial matter is currently in discovery.\nThe plaintiffs and defendants have also taken interlocutory appeals of the courts’ motion to dismiss ruling to the intermediate\nNew York State appellate court, which are pending. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time.\nOther than the matter disclosed above, we are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge are\nany material legal proceedings threatened against us.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risk factor below and other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, which\ncould materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. These risks are not the only risks facing our\nCompany. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company adopted the following plans, approved by the Board, for the purpose of repurchasing its common stock in\naccordance with applicable rules specified in the 1934 Act (the “Repurchase Plans”):\nMaximum Cost of Shares Cost of Shares Remaining Cost of Shares\nDate of Agreement/Amendment That May Be Repurchased Repurchased That May Be Repurchased\nAugust 5, 2015 $ 50.0 million $ 50.0 million $ — million\nDecember 14, 2015 50.0 million 50.0 million — million\nSeptember 14, 2016 50.0 million 50.0 million — million\nOctober 30, 2018 50.0 million 50.0 million — million\nFebruary 6, 2019 50.0 million 48.1 million 1.9 million\nFebruary 3, 2022 25.0 million — million 25.0 million\nTotal as of September 30, 2024 $ 275.0 million $ 248.1 million $ 26.9 million\n133\nThe Repurchase Plans were designed to allow the Company to repurchase its shares both during its open window periods and at\ntimes when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under applicable insider trading laws or because of self-imposed\ntrading blackout periods. A broker selected by the Company will have the authority under the terms and limitations specified in\nan agreement with the Company to repurchase shares on the Company’s behalf in accordance with the terms of the Repurchase\nPlans. Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the\nRepurchase Plans. Pursuant to the Repurchase Plans, the Company may from time to time repurchase a portion of its shares of\ncommon stock and the Company is hereby notifying stockholders of its intention as required by applicable securities laws.\nUnder the Repurchase Plans described above, the Company allocated the following amounts to be repurchased in accordance\nwith SEC Rule 10b5-1 (the “10b5-1 Repurchase Plans”):\nEffective Date Termination Date Amount Allocated to 10b5-1 Repurchase Plans\nSeptember 15, 2015 November 5, 2015 $ 5.0 million\nJanuary 1, 2016 February 5, 2016 10.0 million\nApril 1, 2016 May 19, 2016 5.0 million\nJuly 1, 2016 August 5, 2016 15.0 million\nSeptember 30, 2016 November 8, 2016 20.0 million\nJanuary 4, 2017 February 6, 2017 10.0 million\nMarch 31, 2017 May 19, 2017 10.0 million\nJune 30, 2017 August 7, 2017 10.0 million\nOctober 2, 2017 November 6, 2017 10.0 million\nJanuary 3, 2018 February 8, 2018 10.0 million\nJune 18, 2018 August 9, 2018 10.0 million\nSeptember 17, 2018 October 31, 2018 10.0 million\nDecember 12, 2018 February 7, 2019 10.0 million\nFebruary 25, 2019 May 17, 2019 25.0 million\nMarch 18, 2019 May 17, 2019 10.0 million\nJune 4, 2019 August 7, 2019 25.0 million\nJune 17, 2019 August 7, 2019 20.0 million\nSeptember 16, 2019 November 6, 2019 20.0 million\nDecember 6, 2019 February 5, 2020 25.0 million\nDecember 16, 2019 February 5, 2020 15.0 million\nMarch 12, 2020 March 19, 2020 20.0 million\nMarch 30, 2021 May 21, 2021 10.0 million\nJune 16, 2021 November 5, 2021 10.0 million\nDecember 16, 2021 August 3, 2022 5.0 million\nDecember 27, 2022 February 22, 2023 10.0 million\n134\nThe following table presents information with respect to the Company’s purchases of its common stock since adoption of the\nRepurchase Plans through September 30, 2024:\nMaximum Dollar Value of\nTotal Number Average Price Total Number of Shares Shares That May Yet Be\nof Shares Paid Per Purchased as Part of Purchased Under Publicly\nMonth Purchased Share* Publicly Announced Plans Announced Plans\nAugust 2015 510,000 $ 19.71 510,000 $ $ 40.0 million\nSeptember 2015 603,466 18.46 603,466 28.8 million\nNovember 2015 1,116,666 18.10 1,116,666 8.6 million\nDecember 2015 627,443 17.58 627,443 47.6 million\nJanuary 2016 670,708 14.91 670,708 37.6 million\nJune 2016 362,933 16.73 362,933 31.5 million\nJuly 2016 16,491 16.53 16,491 31.2 million\nAugust 2016 596,294 17.67 596,294 20.7 million\nSeptember 2016 411,523 18.13 411,523 63.2 million\nOctober 2016 527,417 17.82 527,417 53.8 million\nNovember 2016 239,289 17.45 239,289 49.6 million\nAugust 2017 33,333 17.96 33,333 49.0 million\nSeptember 2017 186,767 17.98 186,767 45.7 million\nOctober 2017 144,867 17.96 144,867 43.1 million\nNovember 2017 64,500 17.79 64,500 41.9 million\nDecember 2017 50,100 17.89 50,100 41.0 million\nJanuary 2018 577,386 17.32 577,386 31.0 million\nFebruary 2018 70,567 16.23 70,567 29.9 million\nMay 2018 263,667 17.12 263,667 25.4 million\nJune 2018 198,601 16.94 198,601 22.0 million\nJuly 2018 8,867 16.75 8,867 21.9 million\nAugust 2018 502,767 17.11 502,767 13.3 million\nSeptember 2018 444,467 16.54 444,467 5.9 million\nOctober 2018 160,800 16.46 160,800 53.3 million\nNovember 2018 595,672 15.81 595,672 43.9 million\nDecember 2018 741,389 13.49 741,359 33.9 million\nFebruary 2019 19,392 15.16 19,392 83.6 million\nMarch 2019 291,426 15.40 291,426 79.1 million\nApril 2019 44,534 15.23 44,534 78.4 million\nMay 2019 298,026 15.93 298,026 73.6 million\nJune 2019 607,073 15.97 607,073 63.9 million\nJuly 2019 89,610 16.10 89,610 62.5 million\nAugust 2019 758,020 16.15 758,020 50.3 million\nSeptember 2019 32,371 16.26 32,371 49.7 million\nOctober 2019 495,464 15.65 495,464 42.0 million\nNovember 2019 6,147 15.91 6,147 41.9 million\nMarch 2020 1,286,565 11.62 1,286,565 26.9 million\nMay 2021 145,572 13.92 145,572 24.9 million\nJuly 2021 44,418 13.46 44,418 24.3 million\nAugust 2021 45,675 13.32 45,675 23.7 million\nSeptember 2021 360,860 13.02 360,860 19.0 million\nOctober 2021 308,005 13.30 308,005 14.9 million\nNovember 2021 419,372 13.05 419,372 9.4 million\nDecember 2021 227,429 12.44 227,429 6.6 million\nJanuary 2022 60,605 12.70 60,605 30.8 million\nApril 2022 88,478 12.82 88,478 29.7 million\nMay 2022 40,044 12.57 40,044 29.2 million\nMay 2023 171,061 11.56 171,061 27.2 million\nJune 2023 27,023 11.84 27,023 26.9 million\nTotal 15,593,150 $ 15.91 15,593,120\n* The average price per share is inclusive of commissions.\n135\nItem 3.
