Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\" and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements. For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when it discusses market size forecasts, strategy, market\nposition and ability to compete, anticipated developments in its operations and future financial and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are not\nhistorical facts, and are based upon management's current expectations, beliefs and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Such\nexpectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections\nwill be achieved and actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the\nforward-looking statements including the Company’s ability to implement its strategies, its competitive advantages, the development of new products and\nservices, the impact of competitors, changes in laws, rules and regulations, its ability to maintain its product certifications, its ability to maintain good relationships\nwith customers, suppliers and other strategic partners, its ability to protect its intellectual property, its ability to retain key personnel and the absence of material\nadverse changes in the industry or global economy. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting the Company, reference is made to the\nCompany's Registration Statement on Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Before you invest you should read the\npreliminary prospectus in that registration statement for more complete information about the Company and the offering.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to\nreflect actual results, subsequent events or circumstances, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information except to the\nextent required by applicable securities laws. If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the\nCompany will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements.\n2\nNasdaq:MOB\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition • A significant growth in the number of personnel would place a strain upon our management and\n• We have a history of losses. resources.\n• We expect that we will need to invest significant time and raise substantial additional capital • We are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations in other countries.\nbefore we can expect to become profitable from sales of our products.
