          "content": "Meta Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nMENLO PARK, Calif. – October 30, 2024 – Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\"We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO.\n\"We also have strong momentum with Meta AI, Llama adoption, and AI-powered glasses.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIn millions, except percentages and per share amounts 2024 2023 % Change\nRevenue $ 40,589 $ 34,146 19 %\nCosts and expenses 23,239 20,398 14 %\nIncome from operations $ 17,350 $ 13,748 26 %\nOperating margin 43 % 40 %\nProvision for income taxes $ 2,134 $ 2,437 (12) %\nEffective tax rate 12 % 17 %\nNet income $ 15,688 $ 11,583 35 %\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS) $ 6.03 $ 4.39 37 %\nThird Quarter 2024 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\n• Family daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.29 billion on average for September 2024, an increase of 5% year-\nover-year.\n• Ad impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 7% year-over-year.\n• Average price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 11% year-over-year.\n• Revenue – Total revenue was $40.59 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Revenue on a constant currency basis\nwould have increased 20% year-over-year.\n• Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\n• Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\n• Capital return program – Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and\ndividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\n• Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were\n$70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\n• Long-term debt – Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\n• Headcount – Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n1\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is\napproximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For\nReality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product\ndevelopment efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of\n$37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end\nweighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year\nas we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in\nthe EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings\nconference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release,\nfinancial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

When Facebook launched in 2004, it\nchanged the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world.\nNow, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next\nevolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com / investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com / about.fb.com/news/\n3\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-\nlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the\nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability\nto retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and\nmobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party\npolicies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as\nother new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community\ngrowth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and\nreputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks\nassociated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain\ncountries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated\nwith acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market\nconditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause\nactual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and\non the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 30, 2024, and any\nforward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We\nundertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue\nexcluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation\nof these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information\nprepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the\nuse of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial\nperformance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent\nof business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our\nbusiness.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 using the\nprior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a\nuseful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and\nequipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that\nthese two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business,\nregardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide\nuseful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not\nintended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see\nthe \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

The numbers for DAP do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their other activities on our Family products.\nWe do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of\nDAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual\nproduct and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on\ninternal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. For additional information, see \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" located in\nthe Appendix of this presentation. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of\napproximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\n10\nFamily Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)\n$12.33 $12.29\n$11.89\n$11.20\n$10.93\n$10.68\n$10.42\n$9.44 $9.47\nQ3'22 Q4'22 Q1'23 Q2'23 Q3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24 Q3'24\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, we define average revenue per person (ARPP) as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter.

FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are: (i) FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, and (ii) other companies\nin our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n15\nLimitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\nFamily Metrics\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP)\nand average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp\n(collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage\nof our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to\nalgorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in\nour methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their\naccuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the\nerror margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges\nin measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable\nonline and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family\nmetrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family\nmetrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier\nor link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these\nmetrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These\ntechniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We\nestimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for\nour Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple\nuser accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or\ntrends.\n16\nLimitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated\nagainst user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and\nacross multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys\nhave in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals\nfrom WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to\ndata signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of\nFamily metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user\nsurveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are\nintended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the first quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted\nsolely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example,\nwe look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into\nWhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the\npercentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of\nviolating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nUser Geography\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by\ndata limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP\naddress and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the\nlocation of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other\ntechnical errors.\n17\nMeta Earnings Presentation\nQ3 2024\ninvestor.fb.com"

Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms third quarter 2024 earnings\nconference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li,\nCFO.\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today\nwill include forward‐looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those\ncontemplated by these forward‐looking statements.\nFactors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s earnings press\nrelease, and in our quarterly report on form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward‐looking\nstatements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no\nobligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non‐GAAP financial measures. A\nreconciliation of GAAP to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The\nearnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.fb.com.\nAnd now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO\nThanks, Ken. This was a good quarter with strong product and business momentum, and with\nparts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing coming into sharper focus.\nWe estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each\nday -- and we're seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard\nacross the industry.\nSo let's start with some highlights from the apps. For WhatsApp, the US remains one of our\nfastest growing countries. And we just passed a milestone of 2 billion calls made globally every\nday. On Facebook, we continue to see positive trends with young adults, especially in the US. On\nInstagram, global growth remains strong. We also launched Teen Accounts this quarter, which add\nbuilt-in protections that limit who teens are messaging and what content they can see. On\nThreads, the community now has almost 275 million monthly actives. It has been growing more\nthan 1 million sign-ups per day. Engagement is growing too. So we continue to be on track\ntowards this becoming our next major social app.\nWe are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we're seeing AI have a positive impact\non nearly all aspects of our work -- from our core business engagement and monetization to our\nlong-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms. And I think that this partially\ncomes from having a vision and roadmap that is aligned with the direction that technology is\nheading, but even more importantly from our teams doing some really excellent work on execution\non so many fronts.\n1\nMeta AI now has more than 500 monthly actives. Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video\nrecommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on\nInstagram this year alone. More than a million advertisers used our GenAI tools to create more\nthan 15 million ads in the last month, and we estimate that businesses using Image Generation are\nseeing a 7% increase in conversions -- and we believe that there is a lot more upside here.\nWe're also seeing great momentum with Llama. Llama token usage has grown exponentially this\nyear, and the more widely that Llama gets adopted and becomes the industry standard, the more\nthat the improvements to its quality and efficiency will flow back to all of our products. This\nquarter, we released Llama 3.2, including the leading small models that run on-device and open\nsource multi-modal models. We're working with enterprises to make it easier to use, and now\nwe're also working with the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.\nThe Llama 3 models have been something of an inflection point in the industry, but I'm even more\nexcited about Llama 4, which is now well into its development. We're training the Llama 4 models\non a cluster that is bigger than 100k H100s or bigger than anything that I've seen reported for\nwhat others are doing. I expect that the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready first, and they’ll be\nready, we expect sometime early next year, and I think that they're going to be a big deal on\nseveral fronts -- new modalities, capabilities, stronger reasoning, and much faster. It seems pretty\nclear to me that open source will be the most cost-effective, customizable, trustworthy,\nperformant, and easiest-to-use option that is available to developers, and I'm proud that Llama is\nleading the way on this.\nNow it's the time of the year at Meta when we plan our budget for the next year. That's still in\nprogress, but I wanted to share a few things that have stood out to me as we've gone through this\nprocess so far. First, it's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to\naccelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we\nshould invest more there. Second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure,\nand I expect to continue investing significantly there too. We haven't decided on a final budget\nyet, but those are some of the directional trends I'm seeing.\nMoving on, this quarter we also had several milestones around Reality Labs and the integration of\nAI and wearables.\nRay-Ban Meta glasses are the prime example here. They're great-looking glasses that let you take\nphotos and videos, listen to music and take calls. But what makes them really special is the Meta\nAI integration. With our new updates it'll be able to not only answer your questions throughout the\nday, but also help you remember things, give you suggestions as you're doing things using real-\ntime multimodal AI, and even translate other languages right in your ear for you. I continue to think\nthat glasses are the ideal form factor for AI because you can let your AI see what you see, hear\nwhat you hear, and talk to you.\nDemand for the glasses continues to be very strong. The new clear edition that we released at\nConnect sold out almost immediately and has been trading online for over a thousand dollars.\nWe've deepened our partnership with EssilorLuxottica to build future generations of smart\neyewear that deliver both cutting-edge technology and style.\nAt Connect we also showed Orion, our first full holographic AR glasses. We've been working on\nthis one for about a decade, and it gives you a sense of where this is all going. We're not too far off\nfrom being able to deliver great-looking glasses that let you seamlessly blend the physical and\n2\ndigital worlds so you can feel present with anyone no matter where they are. We're starting to see\nthe next computing platform come together, and it's pretty exciting.\nWe also released our newest mixed reality headset: Quest 3S. It brings the best capabilities of\nQuest 3 -- high quality color passthrough, a new chipset, and more -- at the much more accessible\nprice point of $300. Reviews are great so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing how well it does\nthis holiday season as more people get their hands on it.\nOverall, this has been a good quarter. I'm pretty amped about all the work that we're doing right\nnow. This may be the most dynamic moment that I've seen in our industry, and I'm focused on\nmaking sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead.\nAnd if we do this well, then the potential for Meta and everyone building with us will be massive.\nAs always, I'm grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us -- our teams, our partners, and\nour investors.\nAnd now here's Susan.\nSusan Li, CFO\nThanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.\nLet’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless\notherwise noted.\nQ3 total revenue was $40.6 billion, up 19% or 20% on a constant currency basis.\nQ3 total expenses were $23.2 billion, up 14% compared to last year.\nIn terms of the specific line items:\nCost of revenue increased 19%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs.\nR&D increased 21%, mostly driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs.\nMarketing & Sales decreased 2% driven primarily by lower restructuring costs.\nG&A decreased 10% driven primarily by lower legal-related expenses.\nWe ended the third quarter with over 72,400 employees, up 9% year-over-year, with growth\nprimarily driven by hiring in our priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs,\ngenerative AI, as well as regulation and compliance.\nThird quarter operating income was $17.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 12%.\nNet income was $15.7 billion or $6.03 per share.\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.2 billion, driven by\ninvestments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Our capital expenditures were\n3\nimpacted in part by the timing of third quarter server deliveries, which will be paid for in the fourth\nquarter.\nFree cash flow was $15.5 billion. In Q3, we completed a debt offering of $10.5 billion, repurchased\n$8.9 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending\nthe quarter with $70.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt.\nMoving now to our segment results.\nI’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.\nOur community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with more than 3.2 billion people\nusing at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September.\nQ3 Total Family of Apps revenue was $40.3 billion, up 19% year over year.\nQ3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $39.9 billion, up 19% or 20% on a constant currency basis.\nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year\ngrowth, followed by healthcare and entertainment and media.\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 23%\nand 21%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 18% and North America grew 16%. On an advertiser\ngeography basis, total revenue growth was strongest in North America and Europe at 21%. Rest\nof World was up 17%, while Asia Pacific was the slowest growing region at 15%, decelerating from\nour second quarter growth rate of 28% due mainly to lapping a period of stronger demand from\nChina-based advertisers.\nIn Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 7% and the\naverage price per ad increased 11%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest\nof World. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad\nperformance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing\nregions and surfaces.\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $434 million, up 48%, driven primarily by business messaging\nrevenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.\nWe continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of\nour Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.5 billion, representing approximately\n80% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 13%, primarily due to higher\ninfrastructure and headcount-related expenses, partially offset by lower legal-related expenses.\nFamily of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 54% operating margin.\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $270 million, up 29% driven by hardware sales.\nReality Labs expenses were $4.7 billion, up 19% year-over-year driven primarily by higher\nheadcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs.\nReality Labs operating loss was $4.4 billion.\n4\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue\nperformance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness\nat monetizing that engagement over time.\nOn the first, we are focused on both improving people’s experiences within our apps today and\ninvesting in longer-term initiatives that have the potential to contribute to engagement in the\nyears ahead.\nWe expect our content recommendations roadmap will span both of these timeframes, as we have\nnearer-term workstreams focused on improving recommendations as well as multi-year initiatives\nto develop innovative new approaches.\nI’ll focus first on the near-term. In the third quarter, we continued to see daily usage grow year-\nover-year across Facebook and Instagram, both globally and in the U.S.\nOn Facebook, we’re seeing strong results from the global rollout of our unified video player in\nJune. Since introducing the new experience and prediction systems that power it, we’ve seen a\n10% increase in time spent within the Facebook video player. This month, we’ve entered the next\nphase of Facebook’s video product evolution. Starting in the US & Canada, we are updating the\nstandalone video tab to a full screen viewing experience, which will allow people to seamlessly\nwatch videos in a more immersive experience. We expect to complete this global roll out in early\n2025.\nOn Instagram, Reels continues to see good traction and we’re making ongoing progress with our\nfocus on promoting original content, with more than 60% of recommendations now coming from\noriginal posts in the U.S. This is helping people find unique and differentiated content on\nInstagram while also helping earlier stage creators get discovered.\nNext, let me talk more about our multi-year roadmap for recommendations. Previously, we\noperated separate ranking and recommendation systems for each of our products because we\nfound that performance did not scale if we expanded the model size and compute power beyond a\ncertain point. However, inspired by the scaling laws we were observing with large language\nmodels, last year we developed new ranking model architectures capable of learning more\neffectively from significantly larger data sets. To start, we have been deploying these new\narchitectures to our Facebook video ranking models, which has enabled us to deliver more\nrelevant recommendations and unlock meaningful gains in watch time.\nNow, we’re exploring whether these new models can unlock similar improvements to\nrecommendations on other surfaces. After that, we will look to introduce cross-surface data to\nthese models so our systems can learn from what is interesting to someone on one surface of our\napps and use it to improve their recommendations on another. This will take time to execute, and\nthere are other explorations that we will pursue in parallel. However, over time we are optimistic\nthat this will unlock more relevant recommendations while also leading to higher engineering\nefficiency as we operate a smaller number of recommendation models.\nBeyond recommendations, we’re making progress with our other longer-term engagement\npriorities, including Generative AI and Threads.\nMeta AI usage continues to scale as we make it available in more countries and languages. We’re\nseeing lifts in usage as we improve our models and have introduced a number of enhancements in\n5\nrecent months to make Meta AI more helpful and engaging. Last month, we began introducing\nVoice, so you can speak with Meta AI more naturally, and it’s now fully available in English to\npeople in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In the US, people can now also upload\nphotos to Meta AI to learn more about them, write captions for posts, and add, remove, or change\nthings about their images with a simple text prompt. These are all built with our first multi-modal\nfoundation model, Llama 3.2.\nThreads remains another area where we see exciting potential. We are bringing on an increasing\nnumber of new users each quarter while depth of engagement also continues to grow. Looking\nahead, we plan to introduce more features to make it even easier for people to stay up to date on\ntopics they care about.\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. There\nare two parts to this work.\nThe first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.\nWe continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video.\nWithin Facebook, video engagement continues to shift to short form following the unification of\nour video player, and we expect this to continue with the transition of the video tab to a full screen\nformat. This is resulting in organic video impressions growing more quickly than overall video time\non Facebook, which provides more opportunities to serve ads.\nAcross both Facebook and Instagram, we are also continuing our broader work to optimize when\nand where we should show ads within a person’s session. This is enabling us to drive revenue and\nconversion growth without increasing the number of ads.\nThe second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance.\nSimilar to organic content ranking, we are finding opportunities to achieve meaningful ads\nperformance gains by adopting new approaches to modeling. For example, we recently deployed\nnew learning and modeling techniques that enable our ads systems to consider the sequence of\nactions a person takes before and after seeing an ad. Previously, our ads systems could only\naggregate those actions together, without mapping the sequence. This new approach allows our\nsystems to better anticipate how audiences will respond to specific ads. Since we adopted the\nnew models in the first half of this year we’ve already seen a 2-4% increase in conversions based\non testing within selected segments.\nWe are also evolving our ads platform to ensure that the results we drive are customized to each\nbusiness’ objectives and to the way they measure value. In Q3, we introduced changes to our ads\nranking and optimization models to take more of the cross-publisher journey into account, which\nwe expect to increase the Meta-attributed conversions that advertisers see in their third party\nanalytics tools. We’re also testing new features and settings for advertisers that will allow them to\noptimize their campaigns for what they value most, such as driving incremental conversions rather\nthan absolute conversions.\nFinally, there is continued momentum with our Advantage+ solutions, including our ad creative\ntools. We’re seeing strong retention with advertisers using our generative AI-powered image\nexpansion, background generation and text generation tools, and they’re already driving improved\nperformance for advertisers even at this early stage. Earlier this month we began testing our first\n6\nvideo generation features - video expansion and image animation. We expect to make them more\nbroadly available by early next year.\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to take a long-term\nview in running the business, which involves investing in a portfolio of opportunities that we\nexpect will generate returns over different time periods. We are very optimistic about the set of\nopportunities in front of us, and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will\nnot only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each\narea. This includes investing in both near-term initiatives to deliver continued healthy revenue\ngrowth within our core business, as well as longer-term opportunities that have the scale to\ndeliver compelling returns over time. Given the lead time of our longer-term investments, we also\ncontinue to maximize our flexibility so that we can react to market developments. Within Reality\nLabs, this has benefited us as we’ve evolved our roadmaps to respond to the earlier-than-\nexpected success of smart glasses. Within generative AI, we expect significantly scaling up our\ninfrastructure capacity now, while also prioritizing its fungibility, will similarly position us well to\nrespond to how the technology and market develop in the years ahead.\nMoving now to our financial outlook.\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance\nassumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based\non current exchange rates.\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of\n$96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to\nexpect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product\ndevelopment efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nTurning now to the capex outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in\nthe range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect\nsignificant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted\nnature of our 2024 capex, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth\nnext year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded\ninfrastructure fleet.\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to\nbe in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal\nand regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and\nour financial results.\nIn closing, this was another good quarter for our business. Our global community continues to\ngrow, we're seeing ongoing momentum across our core priorities, and we have exciting\nopportunities ahead of us to drive further growth in our core business in 2025 and capitalize on\nthe longer-term opportunities ahead.\nWith that, Krista, let’s open up the call for questions.\n7\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To\nask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw\nyour question, again press star one. Please limit yourself to one question.\nPlease pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If\nyou are streaming today’s call, please mute your computer speakers. And your\nfirst question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark and one for Susan.\nMark, I wanted to sort of ask you about Meta AI a little bit.\nCan you help us understand some of the more recurring types of interactions or\nquery types you’re seeing with this product and whether they have commercial\nintent? And then just over time, how do you think about building your own in-\nhouse search offering as opposed to partnering and having another player\npartner those queries?\nAnd then Susan, I wanted to ask you about sort of head count because you\ntalked a lot about sort of infrastructure investment in ‘25. How do we sort of\nthink about relative headcount investments into ‘25 to sort of support all that\ninfrastructure versus what you’ve been doing in 2024? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Brian, thanks for the question. This is Susan. So your first question was around\nwhat kinds of recurring interactions that we see between people and to their\nusage of Meta AI. And we’re seeing -- first of all, I think, as Mark mentioned,\njust we’re excited about the progress of Meta AI.\nIt’s obviously very early in its journey, but it continues to be on track to be the\nmost used AI assistant in the world by end of year and it has over 500 million\nmonthly actives.\nAnd people are using it for many things. A number of the frequent use cases\nwe’re seeing include information gathering, help with how to tasks, which is the\nlargest use case. But we also see people using it to go deeper on interests, to\nlook for content on our services, for image generation, that’s also been another\npretty popular use case so far. And I would say, that in the near term our focus\nis really on making Meta AI increasingly valuable for people and if we’re\nsuccessful, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it\nfor, including more monetizable queries over time.\nThe second part of your question, Meta AI draws from content across the web\nto address timely questions from users, and it provides sources for those\nresults from our search engine partners. We’ve integrated with Bing and\nGoogle, both of whom offer great search experiences.\nLike other companies, we also train our Gen AI models on content that is\npublicly available online, and we crawl the web for a variety of purposes. Your\nsecond question was really, I think, around maybe how we’re thinking about\nheadcount in 2025. And we are still working through our budgeting processes\nfor ‘25. That’s in part why we changed our forward-looking guidance approach\nto give guidance in the next call.\n8\nBut as we’re working through this, we are looking at where there are\nopportunities for us to invest in our strategic priorities and that includes\nmonetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Gen AI, our ongoing investments in\nregulation and compliance.\nAnd we’re really evaluating each of those opportunities with an eye towards\nwhat either the measurable ROI looks like or what the strategic opportunity\nlooks like, depending on what the area is. And we’re supporting that by\ncontinuing to really focus on streamlining our operations elsewhere.\nSo we don’t have -- we don’t have specifics to share about headcount growth\nin 2025, but that gives you a little bit of the flavor of where we are in the\nbudgeting process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nPlease go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just one building on that\nquestion from Brian and going back to Mark’s comments about the learnings as\nyou do go through the business planning process. Mark, I wanted to\nunderstand better what you continue to learn about what the biggest\nopportunity sets are to apply AI to when you think about your platform, your\nproduct portfolio, and your internal processes because you sound quite\noptimistic about key learnings and how they continue to ramp and maybe even\naccelerate in terms of the potential for return profile? I just want to go a little\nbit deeper into what your key learnings are as you go through that process?\nThank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: I think the main point here is just that it seems broadly applicable to a very wide\nvariety of products. So there are areas that are more part of our core business\nfrom making Feed more relevant and Reels more relevant to making ads more\nrelevant to helping advertisers generate better ads, to helping people create\nthe content that they want, helping our integrity operations and compliance\nand the work that we do there, that’s important.\nIt’s very valuable across all these aspects of the core business, but then it also\nis going to enable completely new types of services, like we didn’t have\nsomething like Meta AI before.\nWe didn’t have something like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses before and AI is going\nto be a really important ingredient of all of these things. There are also other\nnew products like that, things around AI Studio.\nThis year, we really focused on rolling out Meta AI as kind of our -- our kind of\nsingle assistant that people can ask any question to, but I think there’s a lot of\nopportunities that I think we’ll see ramp more over the next year in terms of\nboth consumer and business use cases, for people interacting with a wide\nvariety of different AI agents, consumer ones with AI Studio around whether\n9\nit’s different creators or kind of different agents that people create for\nentertainment.\nOr on the business side, we do want to continue making progress on this vision\nof making it so that any small business or any business over time can, with a\nfew clicks, stand up an AI agent that can help do customer service and sell\nthings to all of their customers around the world, and I think that’s a huge\nopportunity.\nSo it’s very broad. And I think part of what we’re seeing is that there are a lot of\nopportunities. Some of the longer-term ones are on Meta AI or AI Studio; those\naren’t necessarily a next few years, massive profit opportunity. But there are a\nlot of things in the core business around engagement and monetization which I\nthink will be, over the next few years.\nSo I think we’re trying to make sure that we get the right people working on\nthis and that we have the right amount of investment that’s just going towards\nwhat we view as a very, very large opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nPlease go ahead.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up first on Meta AI,\nMark. I mean helpful context certainly to understand how people are using the\nplatform today. Maybe you can just talk more about some of that functionality\nover time as agents are introduced, just how you really expect use cases to\nexpand beyond just longer and more complex queries?\nAnd then, Susan, on CapEx, just trying to understand your comment on 4Q a\nlittle bit more. It sounds like some of the payments pushed into 4Q with the\nguidance suggesting $15 billion to $17 billion in CapEx in the quarter? And is\nthat something we should think about as run rate into 2025? Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean I can take the Meta AI question, although I’m sort of intentionally\nnow not saying too much about the new capabilities and modalities that we’re\nlaunching with Llama 4 that are coming to Meta AI.\nI mean I noted in the comments upfront that there -- with each major\ngenerational update, I expect that there will be large new capacities that get\nadded.\nBut I think that, that’s just going to be -- that’s partially what I’m excited about,\nand we’ll talk more about that next year when we’re ready to. One of the trends\nthat I do think we’re going to see though is having the models not just power\nMeta AI or a single assistant, but across AI Studio and business agents, have\nthat grow.\nI mean this year, if you look back to where we were about a year ago, we were\nstarting to roll out Meta AI. This year we have really so far succeeded in having\n10\nthat grow and having a lot of people use that. There’s obviously a lot more\ndepth of engagement and new use cases that we want to add over time.\nBut I’d say that we’re -- today, with AI Studio and business AIs about where we\nwere with Meta AI about a year ago.\nSo I think in the next year, our goal around that is going to be to try to make\nthose pretty widespread use cases, even though there’s going to be a multiyear\npath to getting kind of the depth of usage and the business results around that\nthat we want. So there’s a lot to do here, though, and I’m excited to talk about\nthat starting earlier next year.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Doug. So your second question was about Q4 CapEx. The expected\nstep-up in Q4 CapEx from Q3, part of that comes from increases in server\nspend and to a lesser extent, data center CapEx.\nBut with servers there are these timing dynamics at play that you referred to\nbecause we had these server deliveries that landed late in Q3. And so the cash\ndoesn’t go out the door basically until Q4, and that’s when you’ll see the CapEx\nshow up.\nAnd given the nature of capital expenditures, generally, there is some --\nactually quite a bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. So it’s a little bit hard to\nsort of extrapolate from any particular quarter. Overall, I’d say we’re growing\nour infrastructure investments significantly this year, and we expect significant\ngrowth again in 2025.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nPlease go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. I think I’ll ask a cost question this time. Just thinking about use of AI and\nemployee productivity, how are you able to utilize AI internally? And are you\nseeing big productivity gains in your R&D group? And second, I know I got to\nthe headcount one more time but, Susan, how flexible is your headcount as you\nthink about cost growth in other areas? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Justin, so I’ll take a crack at both of those. On the use of AI and employee\nproductivity, it’s certainly something that we -- that we’re very excited about. I\ndon’t know that we have anything particularly quantitative that we’re sharing\nright now.\nI think there are different efficiency opportunities with AI that we’ve been\nfocused on in terms of where we can reduce costs over time and generate\nsavings through increasing internal productivity in areas like coding.\nFor example, it’s early, but we’re seeing a lot of adoption internally of our\ninternal assistant and coding agent, and we continue to make Llama more\neffective at coding, which should also make this use case increasingly valuable\nto developers over time.\n11\nThere are also places where we hope over time that we’ll be able to deploy\nthese tools against a lot of our content moderation efforts to help make the big\nbody of content moderation work that we undertake, to help make it more\nefficient and effective for us to do so.\nAnd there are lots of other places around the company where I would say we’re\nrelatively early in exploring the way that we can use LLM based tools to make\ndifferent types of work streams more efficient. So all that is to say, it’s\nsomething we’re pretty excited about.\nWe have lots of teams focused on it. There are sort of small opportunities and\nG&A functions to what we hope will be big opportunities in areas like content\nmoderation and coding productivity over time.\nOn your second question about headcount, we’re really -- again, we’re still mid-\nbudget. So there’s -- we don’t have very much that is definitive to share about\nthis at the time. But as we’re evaluating where there are opportunities for us to\nmake good investments, we really think about there is a bucket of very ROI-\ndriven headcount opportunities.\nWe’re very rigorous about the way we think about returns there and what the\nreturn opportunity is and how -- what we think is the likelihood of those returns\nand what is the aggregate incrementality of those investments, and those are\nall things that sort of we’re evaluating when we think about where to invest in\nthe core business and where we think we can -- we can deliver sort of ROI on a\nnearer-term basis.\nAnd then at the same time, we’re also assessing what the opportunities look\nlike in some of the more medium- and long-term strategic areas of investment\nand that includes our efforts in Gen AI and the infrastructure needed to support\nit.\nIt includes our investments in Reality Labs. And so those are all things that\nwe’re kind of assessing in kind of a portfolio of what we could -- what we think\nwe would do in 2025. With a couple of thoughts, one is, again, where can we\nsort of build the most flexibility into the way that we’re thinking about either\ninfrastructure or headcount plans.\nAnd the second is we’re really focused across the company on our efficiency\nefforts broadly and making sure that we feel like we’re continuing to push the\nwhole company including areas in which we expect that we will be making\nadditional headcount investments to think about how they can be more\nefficient in ‘25 than they were in ‘24.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please\ngo ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Just two quick ones, Mark. You said something along the lines of the\nmore standardized Llama becomes the more improvements will flow back to\nthe core Meta business. And I guess, could you just dig in a little bit more on\n12\nthat? So the series of Llama models are being used by lots of developers\nbuilding different things in AI.\nI guess, how are you using that vantage point to incubate new ideas inside\nMeta? And then second question is, you mentioned on one of the podcasts\nafter the Meta Connect that assuming scaling laws hold up, we may need\nhundreds of billions of compute CapEx to kind of reach our goals around Gen\nAI.\nSo I guess, how quickly could you conceivably stand up that much\ninfrastructure given some of the constraints around energy or custom ASICs or\nother factors? Just any more color on the speed by which we could get that\namount of compute online at Meta? Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can try to give some more color on this. I mean the improvements to\nLlama, I’d say come in a couple of flavors. There’s sort of the quality flavor and\nthe efficiency flavor.\nThere are a lot of researchers and independent developers who do work and\nbecause Llama is available, they do the work on Llama and they make\nimprovements and then they publish it and it becomes -- it’s very easy for us to\nthen incorporate that both back into Llama and into our Meta products like\nMeta AI or AI Studio or Business AIs because the work -- the examples that are\nbeing shown are people doing it on our stack.\nPerhaps more importantly is just the efficiency and cost. I mean this stuff is\nobviously very expensive. When someone figures out a way to run this better, if\nthat -- if they can run it 20% more effectively, then that will save us a huge\namount of money.\nAnd that was sort of the experience that we had with Open Compute and why -\n- part of why we are leaning so much into Open Source here in the first place, is\nthat we found counterintuitively with Open Compute that by publishing and\nsharing the architectures and designs that we had for our compute, the\nindustry standardized around it a bit more.\nWe got some suggestions also that helped us save costs and that just ended up\nbeing really valuable for us. Here, one of the big costs is chips -- a lot of the\ninfrastructure there.\nWhat we’re seeing is that as Llama gets adopted more, you’re seeing folks like\nNVIDIA and AMD optimize their chips more to run Llama specifically well which\nclearly benefits us.\nSo it benefits everyone who’s using Llama, but it makes our products better,\nright, rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was\nkind of standardizing around in the industry.\nSo that’s some of what we’re seeing around Llama and why I think it’s good\nbusiness for us to do this in an open way.\n13\nIn terms of scaling infra, I mean when I talk about our teams executing well,\nsome of that goes towards delivering more engaging products and some of it\ngoes towards delivering more revenue.\nOn the infra side, it goes towards building out the expenses faster, right? So I\nthink part of what we’re seeing this year is the infra team is executing quite\nwell. And I think that’s why, over the course of the year, we’ve been able to\nbuild out more capacity.\nI mean going into the year, we had a range for what we thought we could\npotentially do. And we have been able to do, I think, more than, I think, we’d\nkind of hoped and expected at the beginning of the year.\nAnd while that reflects as higher expenses, it’s actually something that I’m\nquite happy that the team is executing well on. And I think that will -- so that\nexecution makes me somewhat more optimistic that we’re going to be able to\nkeep on building this out at a good pace but that’s part of this whole thing. This\nis -- this part of the formula around kind of building out the infrastructure is\nmaybe not what investors want to hear in the near term that we’re growing it\nout.\nBut I just think that the opportunities here are really big. We’re going to\ncontinue investing significantly in this. And I’m proud of the teams that are\ndoing great work to stand up a large amount of capacity so that way we can\ndeliver world-class models and world-class products.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go\nahead.\nRonald Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture one as well, Mark,\njust this time on Threads. Now one of the core apps, and on it’s way to\nbecoming the next major social app and 275 million MAUs.\nI wanted to hear your thoughts on how this product evolves over time,\nspecifically from a monetization perspective, but also next steps on users? And\nthen, Susan, with pricing up 11% in the quarter, I wanted to hear more about the\npricing dynamics on the platform.\nI think you talked about just pricing increasing due to greater advertising\ndemand and improved ad performance. So help us understand that a little bit\nmore. Thank you.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Ron. So your first question was about Threads. We’re making good\nprogress there. We are continuing to launch more features and make\nimprovements to our ranking stack. We feel very good about the continued\nuser growth on Threads.\nWe’re bringing on an increasing number of users each quarter and depth of\nengagement also continues to grow. And in Q3, we saw especially strong user\n14\ngrowth in key markets like the U.S., Taiwan and Japan. And we -- we’ve added a\nnumber of new features over the course of Q3 including account insights for\nbusinesses and creators to see how they’re posts perform, the ability to save\nmultiple drafts, continuing to deliver on our commitment to integrate Threads\nwith the Fediverse and basically, we’re very focused on continuing to build out\nthe sort of functionality of Threads over time and being responsive to what\nusers tell us that they’re interested in.\nSpecifically, as it pertains to monetization, we don’t expect Threads to be a\nmeaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time.\nWe’ve been just pleased with the growth trajectory and again, are really\nfocused on introducing features that the community finds valuable and\nworking to deepen growth and engagement. Your second question was about\nthe increase in average price per ad.\nSo that grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong advertiser demand and part\nof that is because of better ad performance over time also. And we saw that\nCPM growth accelerate slightly from 10% in Q2, in part because we\nexperienced lower impression growth in Q3.\nBut more broadly, as we think about pricing growth and this metric, the year-\nover-year growth in reported price per ad, there’s a lot that goes into that\nincluding the auction dynamics resulting from fluctuations and impression\ngrowth. And one of the things that we feel like we’re very focused on is really\nthe input metrics.\nWhat are the conversions that we are delivering to advertisers? Are they\ngetting more value over time? The sort of blended reported price per ad is\ncomplicated because all of those things get rolled up into it.\nThere are so many different objectives that advertisers are optimizing for,\nthose objectives have very different values that make them hard to compare on\nan apples-to-apples basis.\nBut we care a lot about conversion growth, which is growing, continues to grow\nfaster than impression growth. And are we seeing healthy cost per action or\ncost per conversion trends, which we are. And as long as we continue to get\nbetter at driving conversions for advertisers, that should have the effect of\nlifting CPMs over time, because we’re delivering more conversions per\nimpressions served and that will result in higher value impressions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\nPlease go ahead.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Thanks for the opportunity. I appreciate that. I have a bigger picture kind of\nlike ecosystem question here. Is -- when we think -- I’m curious, how far do you\nthink we are from seeing a proliferation of third-party AI applications,\nspecifically on the kind of the consumer side? I know we’re seeing more and\nmore on the enterprise side, agents, et cetera.\n15\nBut when do we see -- how far out until we see a proliferation of consumer\napplications in the AI space? And how would you think about -- and how does\nMeta think of itself as one of those key applications in the mobile internet and\nthe desktop internet? But now you’re also seemingly an infrastructure player as\nwell. So I’d love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean there are a lot of consumer products that we’re working on. And\nwith Llama, I would expect that app developers will be able to build a lot of\nreally good things, too.\nI’ve touched on Meta AI and AI Studio and Business AIs a bunch, and I expect\nthose to be important parts of the consumer experience. Another part that I\nhaven’t talked about quite as much yet is the opportunity for AI to help people\ncreate content that just makes people’s feed experiences better.\nIf you look at the big trends in Feeds over the history of the company, it started\noff as friends, right? So all the updates that were in there were basically from\nyour friends posting things. And then we went into this era where we added in\ncreator content too, where now a very large percent of the content on\nInstagram and Facebook is not from your friends.\nIt may not even be from people that you’re following directly. It could just be\nrecommended content from creators that we can algorithmically determine is\ngoing to be interesting and engaging and valuable to you.\nAnd I think we’re going to add a whole new category of content, which is AI\ngenerated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together\nby AI in some way. And I think that that’s going to be just very exciting for the -\n- for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of Feed\nexperiences over time.\nIt’s something that, we’re starting to test different things around this. I don’t\nknow if we know exactly what’s going to work really well yet. Some things are\npromising. I don’t know that -- this isn’t going to be a big impact on the\nbusiness in ‘25 would be my guess.\nBut I think that there is -- I have high confidence that over the next several\nyears, this is going to be an important trend and one of the important\napplications. But you’re going to get that, you’re going to get Meta AI, AI\nStudio, business AIs and a whole lot of things that developers would do with\nLlama too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist\nSecurities. Please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Yes, thank you very much. Mark, it appears that Meta AI now crawls the web\nand provides conversational answers about pretty much anything including\ncurrent events. And so with over ten million advertisers and one of the best\nROAS offerings out there in your core business, just wondering if there are any\n16\nplans to start maybe testing ads on commercial queries, and move Meta AI\ncloser to becoming a real answer engine for the billions of queries that you guys\nare already seeing?\nAnd then Susan, one of the biggest areas of pushback we get is around Reality\nLabs and the ongoing losses there, I think $16 billion last year, probably north\nof $20 billion this year. The question is, are we getting any closer to peak losses\nthere or alternatively, what products do you think have the biggest potential\nthere over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nSusan Li: I’m happy to take both of these, Youssef. So your first question was on plans to\nprovide ads on commercial queries. I think I alluded to this maybe in a much\nearlier question. Right now, we’re really focused on making Meta AI as\nengaging and valuable a consumer experience as possible.\nOver time, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it\nfor. And I think that the monetization opportunities will exist when -- over time\nas we get there.\nBut right now, I would say we are really focused on the consumer experience\nabove all and this is sort of a playbook for us with products that we put out in\nthe world where we really dial in the consumer experience before we focus on\nwhat the monetization could look like. The second part of your question is\nabout Reality Labs.\nWe aren’t sharing expectations beyond 2024 at this point. And we are certainly\nas we think about the 2025 budgeting process for Reality Labs, we’re certainly\nthinking about where we want to make sure we’re putting our sort of focus and\nenergy.\nWe are very excited, again, about the progress that we’ve seen with our smart\nglasses as well as the sort of strong consumer interest in them. And so, we’re\nkind of thinking about where we want to make sure that we are investing\nappropriately behind the consumer momentum that we see.\nOverall, I’d say Reality Labs is clearly one of our strategic long-term priorities,\nand we expect it will be an area of significant investment in -- as we build out\ntowards the very ambitious product roadmap that we have there.\nKenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nPlease go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Let me throw in two questions, please. One, this is a year in which we’ve had a\nlot of unusual events that could be driving ad revenue, major elections in not\njust the U.S., but Europe and in India and major sports events like World Cup\nand I know there’s some other things.\n17\nIs there any -- just in thinking about comps for next year and maybe in the\nfuture, anything Susan, you would call out, like how much of an impact there\nmay have come from these one in every four or five-year events? And then\nsecondly, could you just talk a little bit more about WhatsApp monetization and\nwhere you are with that now?\nIt sounds like the business messaging part is really feeding in nicely into other\nrevenue. But help us think about where the monetization levels of WhatsApp\nare now versus where they can be two or three years down the road, how far\naway we are from optimization? Thank you.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark. So your first question was about sort of the revenue backdrop in\n2024, you mentioned events that occur once every four or five years. So I\nimagine we’re talking about the Olympics. We historically have not seen\nmeaningful incremental contribution from events like the Olympics. We believe\nthat was largely the case this year.\nSo when we think about the Q4 outlook and when we think about going into\nnext year, we generally expect growth to continue to benefit from the healthy\nglobal advertising demand that we’ve seen.\nWe think that our investments in improving our ads performance will continue\nto accrue benefits to advertisers. But obviously, there’s a big range of possible\nmacro backdrops and that’s something that we try to reflect in the range of\nrevenue guidance that we give.\nSo -- but I don’t know that there are a lot of specific events that we would say\nhad a material sort of idiosyncratic to 2024 type of revenue impact. Your\nsecond question was around WhatsApp monetization and where we are. And\nright now what I would say, again, is Click-to-Message is really the big focus\narea for us here.\nWe’re seeing continued traction in this area. And in particular, growth in Click-\nto-WhatsApp Ads remain particularly strong. And so we’re continuing to focus\nboth on scaling Click-to-WhatsApp Ads in more markets where WhatsApp has\nstrong user adoption like Brazil, for example.\nIt’s obviously earlier in the U.S., but we’re seeing good growth in Click-to-\nWhatsApp Ads and are continuing to invest in scaling and consumer adoption\nof WhatsApp in the U.S. also, which will create bigger opportunities down the\nline.\nSo -- and then, of course, a lot of work that we’re doing to make the Click-to-\nMessaging ads more effective and helping to focus for the particular -- helping\nadvertisers optimize, sorry, for the particular conversion events that they care\nabout.\nThe other element of revenue on WhatsApp, I would say, is paid messaging.\nThat continues to grow at a strong pace again this quarter.\n18\nIt remains, in fact, the primary driver of growth in our Family of Apps other\nrevenue line, which was up 48% in Q3, and we’re seeing generally a strong\nincrease in the volume of paid conversations driven both by growth in the\nnumber of businesses adopting paid messaging as well as in the conversational\nvolume per business.\nKenneth Dorell: Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. And we look\nforward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call.

Good afternoon and welcome to the follow-up Q&A call. With me\non today’s call are Susan Li, CFO and Chad Heaton, VP of Finance. Before we\nget started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks\ntoday will include forward-looking statements.\nActual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these\nforward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ\nmaterially are set forth in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly\nreport on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on\nassumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these\nstatements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.

Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure\nclarity. If you are streaming today’s call, please mute your computer speakers.\nAnd your first question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\nPlease go ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Susan, a couple. Just I appreciate the\nkind of color around the engagement traction with Meta AI against kind of the\n500 million MAUs. Wanted to think about how the engagement is growing\nrelative to kind of the MAU number, something like a WAU/MAU.\n1\nAnd then second question is a bit more mechanical. Just on the guidance\naround the tax rate, how do we think about that just kind of going forward into\n2025 and some of the puts and takes around that? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark. So your first question was around more color on engagement\nrelative to Meta AI.\nSo I don’t think we have shared the kind of retention metrics that you are\ndescribing, sort of like daily or weekly actives relative to monthly actives. I\nthink we’ve been talking about it more qualitatively so far.\nWe're happy with the growth overall. We’re continuing to see particularly\npromising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement. India is\nand remains our largest market for Meta AI usage.\nAnd it’s interesting because we see that people engage with Meta AI from a\nvariety of different entry points. The deepest engagement occurs via\nmessaging, although we also are seeing some strong traction with Feed deep\ndives. And people are also using it in group chats and creating images to share\nas posts or stories.\nYour second question was around tax. I don’t think we have given an outlook\nbeyond Q4 and we shared that our Q4 tax rate will also be in the low teens.\nOne of the things that is an interesting dynamic in our tax rate is our tax rate\ntends to be reduced when our share price increases. That’s because the tax\ndeduction for RSUs that we issue as compensation is based on the vesting\nvalue while GAAP recognizes the expense based on the grant value.\nSo you saw that our tax rate through 2024 has been lower relative to what it\nwas in 2023, and that, in part, reflects a higher share price than we had in ’23\nand also, in part, due to some R&D tax credits this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please\ngo ahead.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. I guess, Susan, first, on the decision not\nto provide more details on 2025 spending, how much of that, I guess, if you\ncould elaborate, is really just digesting some of the near-term resources that\nneed to be put to work on all these initiatives? Or is more an effort to drive\nmore efficiency or find more ways to find efficiency I guess in the business?\nSusan Li: Thanks, Colin. So I believe we previewed several quarters ago the decision to\nswitch when we give forward-year guidance from what was historically this\ncall, so the October or Q3 call, to the Q4 or January call. I think maybe we even\npreviewed that a year ago?\nKenneth Dorell: A year ago.\n2\nSusan Li: It was a year ago. Yes. So that’s been a long awaited change. But the reason\nwe made that change back then is because our budgeting process is quite\ndynamic and we found that we really just had a much higher fidelity guidance\nby the time that we were done with the budget, which gets wrapped at the end\nof the year rather than kind of in this October like midway point.\nSo, that’s really the sort of -- the change in timing was because of the timing of\nour budgeting processes and we previewed that a year ago.\nHaving said that, you know, we have spoken a bit qualitatively about the shape\nof 2025 planning. We have talked about the growth and CapEx that we expect,\nyou know, given the sort of capacity ambitions that we have and what we’re\nbuilding in order to fuel sort of our AI and non-AI work for next year.\nAnd then we’ve also talked about -- Mark gave some color in his remarks and I\nspoke a bit about this also on how we’re thinking about the headcount planning\nprocess, where we think we want to make sure that we’re investing\nappropriately to sort of maximize the opportunities for return across a portfolio\nof projects.\nSo, and I think both he and alluded to where those priority areas are and how\nthere’s kind of an ROI bucket that we think about and what the strategic\nbucket looks like. So, all of that will factor into the final 2025 budget, and then\ncorrespondingly the guidance that we give in the January ’25 call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Please go\nahead.\nJames Lee: Great, thanks for taking my question. Susan, I was wondering if you can give us\nan update maybe on AI agents of business. Any update for potential\ncommercial launches for Messenger or maybe WhatsApp? I think last quarter\nyou talked about testing business agent in Southeast Asia and India. And just\nwondering, do you have anything new to call out? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Yes, thanks, James. So, we’re continuing to progress with of tests of AI\nagents. It remains very early but we’ve recently just expanded availability to\nbusinesses using Click-to-Message ads on WhatsApp and Messenger in English\nacross a handful of markets, I think the focus has been still primarily in Asia, I\nthink India and Singapore on WhatsApp, and the Philippines, Singapore,\nMalaysia and the UAE on Messenger.\nOur focus has been to start to support shopping use cases such as responding\nto people who are asking for more information about a product or about its\navailability. We’re also expanding to support (lead gen) to help businesses\ngenerate high-quality leads.\nBut we’re very, very early. This is a place where I would say we are really\nfocused on learning from these tests, in terms of what makes the business AI\nagents most effective and what makes them -- how the businesses who deploy\n3\nthem are measuring success and how we can drive the most value with this use\ncase.\nSo, again, this is very early in our journey. There is a lot that we’re working on\ngoing forward; the response quality we expect will continue to improve both\nwith our ongoing work along with the next generation of Llama models.\nWe expect the scaling to languages beyond English will be an important part of\nthe growth here going forward. And ultimately, also expanding the types of\nresponses that business AIs can support, improving the quality of those\nresponses and fine-tuning the responses based on what we learn from kind of\nthe current test data, and building richer in-thread experiences.\nSo, all this is to say there is a lot of work that is underway, but the long road of\nthe business AI journey is ahead of us.\nKenneth Dorell: Krista, can we go to the next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Moffett\nNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you. Susan, I have one hard one and one easier one. I wonder when\nyou talked about the near-term opportunities to improve recommendation and\nthen monetization, how quickly do you think you see the ROI on that CapEx\nspend? Is there anything you’ve done on kind of when do we start seeing it,\nperhaps the results or something there?\nAnd then the easier one is think about the CapEx spend this year. Is there\nanything you can help us with between maybe shorter cycle depreciation like\nservers versus how much of this spend, percentage wise, will be on longer cycle\nthings like infrastructure? So anything there would be helpful. Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Michael. So across the set of things that we’re investing in with our AI\ninvestments, with our core AI work, we’ve talked a lot historically about how\nwe have a very ROI-based approach to our investments here.\nWe’re still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad\nperformance translate to revenue gains. I think Mark mentioned that this year\nthe ranking improvements we’ve made have delivered an 8% increase in time\nspent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram.\nAnd there are a number of other opportunities across our core AI work that we\nsee to continue delivering good ROI against those investments.\nAnd the Gen AI work, obviously, is much earlier, but even then, we expect\nthey're going to open up avenues for us to accrue value to different parts of our\nbusiness, with those happening along different timeframes, too.\nAnd so, in the Core Ads business, the Gen AI tools that we have built here that\nwill help us enable businesses to make ads significantly more customized at\n4\nscale, which is going to accrue to ad performance, that’s a place where, again,\nwe’re already seeing promising results in both performance gains and adoption.\nI think we shared that over a million advertisers use our Gen AI ad tools\nspecifically.\nSo there are a lot of opportunities even in the sort of nearer-term roadmap for\nthe deployment of Gen AI tools and technologies to make the Core Ads\nbusiness better, again, that we’re excited about in the nearer term.\nSo I would say there are a good number of opportunities of that nature core AI\nranking, recommendation, improvements and deployments of Gen AI within\nthe Core Ads business that we expect are going to deliver ROI well before some\nof the longer-term Gen AI bets around business messaging, Meta AI, et cetera.\nSo that’s the first question. Your second question is…\nChad Heaton: Yes. I’ll pick up the second question about your infra CapEx. So I think Susan\nmentioned here, we’re still working through our 2025 infrastructure plan, but\nat this point we expect total infrastructure spend within each of non-Gen AI,\nGen AI, and core AI to increase in 2025.\nWe expect servers will be the largest driver of growth in 2025 and remain the\nlargest portion of our overall CapEx budget, though we also expect higher\nspend in data centers and network equipment as we continue to just scale our\noverall infra footprint.\nAs I mentioned, servers are going to be the largest driver of growth. We expect\ngrowth in non-AI capacity as we invest in the core business, including to\nsupport a higher base of engagement as well as refreshing existing servers, as\nwell as AI capacity as we scale Gen AI training and continue to invest\nmeaningfully in core AI.\nWe do anticipate data center spend to be higher in 2025, primarily due to us\nentering the core construction phase of our smaller, higher-density data\ncenters that we’ve discussed previously. And we’re building higher capacity\nnetworks to accommodate the growth in Gen AI and Core AI-related traffic in\n2025, along with investing in fiber to handle future cross-region training traffic.\nSo, those are some of the drivers that we’ll be expecting on the infra side in\n2025.\nSusan Li: And, actually, just before we move on, I want to come back to my first answer.\nI realize I kind of answered more with a focus on the monetization bit\nspecifically. You also asked about recommendations and I wanted to sort of\nelaborate here and to just say, we think that we have actually a lot of\nopportunity to improve recommendations, both in near-term and longer-term\nprojects. But some of the nearer-term opportunities are really around\nrelevance gains as we scale our models for content recommendation.\nSo the first is increasing model complexity. That’s going to enable us to learn\nmore from the same data with more compute. And the second is expanding\ndata sets so that we can learn from more data. And we’re also just making a lot\n5\nof optimizations to the existing recommendation systems that help drive\nincremental improvements and efficiency.\nSo, on Instagram in Q3, for example, we completed infra-efficiency projects\nthat consolidated some of our existing recommendation systems, that lets us\nconcentrate our future improvements on a smaller number of recommendation\nmodels, it drives higher engineering efficiency going forward.\nAnd then in the longer term, there are a lot of new model architectures we’re\nworking on. We have benefitted, frankly, over the past few years from\nintegrating new model architecture into the Facebook Reels recommendation\nsystem. We talked about the watch time gains last year when we switched\nfrom CPUs to GPUs for Facebook Reels. And we’re continuing to explore how\nto, basically, integrate these types of models to the recommendation systems\nfor other surfaces.\nAnd again, I think that is a place where we expect that we will be able to make\nour recommendation systems deliver more relevant and interesting content.\nAnd that, again, is something that is, for us, we are able to measure how\neffectively we can do that and how much we can drive growth and engagement\nover time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Salmon with New Street\nResearch. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Salmon: Good afternoon, everyone. Susan, on the call, you called out the growing use of\nAdvantage+ creative tools and a wider expansion for them coming next year.\nHow would you compare the revenue potential of that module or tactic to the\nimpact that you’ve seen from Advantage+ shopping campaigns, which you\nnoted is driving over $10 billion of revenue a few quarters ago? And then just\nsecond, any quick update on the traction for Advantage+ app campaigns that\nyou’re seeing? Thanks.\nChad Heaton: Yes, I can share a little bit about Advantage+. We are seeing continued growth\nwith our single step and our end-to-end automated solutions, that includes\nAdvantage+ shopping, and as you mentioned, Advantage+ app campaigns. On\nthe Advantage+ shopping side, growth remains really strong.\nWe’ve seen increased adoption since we rolled out the extended list of\nconversions businesses can optimize for in Q2. On the Advantage+ app ads,\nwe’re seeing growing adoption of app campaigns and particularly a success in\nthe gaming vertical, which is a stronger vertical for app objectives in general.\nIn Q3, we continued testing a new end-to-end automation solution that\nsupports lead-gen campaigns. So, Advantage+ lead campaigns are sort of\nsimilar to Advantage+ shopping campaigns. It enables advertisers to apply AI\nto multiple campaign levers at once for ads using the lead’s objective, including\naudience-created placements and budget.\n6\nSo overall we continue to see a lot of opportunity in our Advantage+ suite of\nsolutions. We also expect the features that we’re introducing to drive results\nmore customized to each business objectives, like conversion value rules, will\nenable us to better optimize AI-enabled campaigns. So yes, overall it’s going\nreally well and continues to be a driver of our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe\nResearch. Please go ahead.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you so much for taking my question. Is it possible to talk about the DAP\nresult in this quarter, anything in particular, did it come in ahead, in line, or\nbelow your expectations? And something -- because it also impacts\nimpressions growth, so any color on that would be great, thank you.\nSusan Li: I mentioned this on the call, but we continue to see daily usage grow year over\nyear across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in Q3, both globally and in the\nU.S., so we feel good about the engagement trends overall both from a usage\nperspective, as well as deeper engagement metrics in the way people spend\ntime on the platform, and also our ability to continue to improve our ranking\nsystems and deliver good content and video recommendations that make\npeople’s experiences more interesting and valuable.\nChad Heaton: And then in terms of impressions, we had 7% year over year impression growth\nthat was driven by users, as Susan mentioned, but also video engagement\ngrowth across Facebook and Instagram.\nSo I think we felt good about the impression growth. As we’re looking forward\ninto 2025, we continue to see impression growth opportunities through\nengagement growth and ongoing ad load optimizations for our video products.\nSo yes, we’re feeling good about the opportunities here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Kulkarni with Roth Capital.\nPlease go ahead.\nRohit Kulkarni: Hey, thank you, couple of questions, one on depreciation and the lifetime of\nservers. I think you guys are the only ones who are depreciating it over five\nyears, most of the servers and networking equipment -- a few of your peers are\nextending lives to six years. So maybe talk about the decision-making behind\nthat.\nAnd second is on Reality Labs and the OpEx for Reality Labs. It has\nconsistently increased as a percentage of overall OpEx. With Orion out there,\nthe hypothesis is that perhaps the velocity of spend may start to slow down a\nlittle bit. Would love to get your reaction to that as well as how do you think\nabout the decision-making around increasing OpEx from Reality Labs into the\nnext couple years?\nSusan Li: Thank you, Rohit. So the first question around useful lives on servers, we don’t\ncurrently have plans to extend the useful lives of our servers. That’s really\nbecause, given the ongoing performance gains from new generations of GPU-\n7\nbased servers, we really want to make sure that we are making the best use of\nthe capacity available in our data centers by using the latest generation of\nservers.\nBut we do periodically evaluate server useful life, and when we do, we’ll take\ninto consideration the historical data of how long we used them for and future\nlooking data on server retirement plans. But again, no current plans to extend\nthe useful lives of our servers. The second question you had was around…\nChad Heaton: Reality Labs.\nSusan Li: Reality Labs and the way we think about the investment in Reality Labs. I\nwould say we are -- we have a really big investment portfolio here. It is\nmultifaceted across both the current and next generation of hardware devices\nand software.\nIn the near-term, we’re really focused on growing adoption of our existing\nproducts. We want to accelerate the adoption of products like the Ray-Ban\nMetas that we’ve seen have very strong product market fit and that, frankly,\nwe think are accelerating the timeline on sort of bringing AR glasses to market\nand are just an extremely natural form factor for a lot of our AI tools.\nYou kind of talked about Orion, and much of our investment, of course, is in\nareas that are not currently reflected in products on the market. There’s still a\nlot to do around conducting the fundamental R&D to invest and productize and\nscale new technologies. And there is certainly a lot we need to do on Orion\nbefore we think it’s ready to be a product that we would bring to market in\nterms of making both the actual display quality better, the form factor more\ncomfortable, and making it more affordable to build at scale.\nSo there is -- it's just a big portfolio in Reality Labs. It’s a place where, while the\nambitions are significant and, again, span a lot of products, it’s also a place\nwhere we’re focused on efficiency, too, and that is definitely a part of the\nbudget conversation, which is where are the places where we can be more\nefficient in Reality Labs such that we have room to expand our ambitions\naround things like smart glasses and accelerate bringing those to market and\ntrying to find tradeoffs as we think about the Reality Labs portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nPlease go ahead.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to ask a bit about gross margin.\nWith the significant CapEx year-to-date and at the end of last year, you’ve\nbeen able to offset that as far as impact on gross margin through just really\nstrong revenue. I mean, obviously you're not going to give us guidance, but\nshould we start to think about gross margin being negatively impacted by kind\nof CapEx?\nAnd I don’t know if it specifically starts in fourth quarter, but as we move\nthrough next year, just maybe how should we think about gross margin I guess\n8\ngoing forward? And then just quick housekeeping and you may have said it in\nthe main call and I missed it, but just why did G&A step down by like a little less\nthan $2 billion sequentially? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Yes. I’ll get to your G&A question first. So the decrease in G&A, that really was\ndriven primarily by lower legal-related expenses. There’s kind of lumpiness in\nG&A on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to the nature of legal accruals and\nexpenses, and in Q3 we just didn’t have the same level of legal-related\nexpenses that we had in the first two quarters of the year.\nAnd then your first question about gross margins, obviously there are multiple\ncomponents. We’ve talked about the depreciation expenses that we expect to\naccelerate significantly as the impact of the CapEx build to date and next year’s\nincremental CapEx flow through.\nThe cost structure, we’re not breaking that out specifically between cost\nrevenue and R&D, but we’re generally investing across our infrastructure fleet\nand the cost of revenue, infrastructure costs do capture all the depreciation\nand OpEx of our infra operations outside of what’s used for AI research. So,\nthat’s the sort of piece that is specific to Gen AI training, Reality Labs, and\nFAIR and that goes into the R&D bucket instead. And then, of course, how\nsuccessfully we’re able to deliver returns and drive revenue growth in 2025.\nKenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\nPlease go ahead.\nJim: Hi, thanks, this is Jim on for Tom. Appreciate you guys taking the question.\nGaming was called as a vertical of strength, not this quarter but for, I think, the\nfour quarters prior. Would be curious kind of what drove that and maybe why\nthat wasn’t a driver of strength in this quarter. And then, secondly, would just\nbe curious to kind of hear the status of the Messaging business in the U.S. and\nthe ambitions there. Thank you.\nChad Heaton: On verticals, we don’t typically call out -- we usually focus on which were our\ndrivers of strength. We called the online commerce vertical was the largest\ncontributor to year-over-year growth. That was followed by healthcare and\nthen entertainment and media verticals. I can share a little bit more about\nthose.\nOnline commerce, the growth remained healthy but slowed from Q2, primarily\ndue to lapping accelerating growth from China-based advertisers from a year\nago. On the healthcare side, it was one of our fastest growing verticals in Q3.\nWe saw broad-based strength across advertiser regions with particular\nstrength in North America.\nAnd then on entertainment and media, again, saw strong year-over-year\ngrowth there. It was driven by broad-based strength across North America and\nAsia-based advertisers, particularly from China. So gaming still is an important\n9\nvertical for us but it just wasn’t one of the biggest contributors in this most\nrecent quarter.\nSusan Li: And on your first -- second question, sorry. Status of the Messaging business\nin the U.S. I think we talked about this maybe a little bit on one of the earlier\nquestions. We are really focused on scaling Click-to-Message ads across the\ntwo levers of both broadening adoption in more markets as well as facilitating\nmore down funnel conversions.\nOn that market piece, it is earlier in the U.S. We are seeing good growth in\nClick-to-WhatsApp ads. And that is a place where we are continuing to invest\nin scaling consumer adoption of WhatsApp and that’s going to create a bigger\nopportunity for us with the Click-to-WhatsApp business in the U.S., also\nfocusing on down funnel objectives just continues to make those ads more\ngenerally performant and is certainly something that also is, I think, especially\nvaluable to more sophisticated advertisers.\nSo it’s still early. But our ambitions there are that we are going to invest a lot\nhere. It’s a market that we care a lot about and we know that there is a strong\nbusiness Messaging ecosystem in other markets and we want to do everything\nwe can to replicate that success in developed markets like the U.S. and\nWestern Europe.\nKenneth Dorell: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your time and\nwe look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation and\nyou may now disconnect.\n10"

          "content": "Meta Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\nMENLO PARK, Calif. – July 31, 2024 – Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" said\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see\ngood traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\"\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nIn millions, except percentages and per share amounts 2024 2023 % Change\nRevenue $ 39,071 $ 31,999 22 %\nCosts and expenses 24,224 22,607 7 %\nIncome from operations $ 14,847 $ 9,392 58 %\nOperating margin 38 % 29 %\nProvision for income taxes $ 1,641 $ 1,505 9 %\nEffective tax rate 11 % 16 %\nNet income $ 13,465 $ 7,788 73 %\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS) $ 5.16 $ 2.98 73 %\nSecond Quarter 2024 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\n• Family daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.27 billion on average for June 2024, an increase of 7% year-over-\nyear.\n• Ad impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year.\n• Average price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year.\n• Revenue – Total revenue was $39.07 billion, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Revenue on a constant currency\nbasis would have increased 23% year-over-year.\n• Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $24.22 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\n• Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.47 billion.\n• Capital return program – Share repurchases were $6.32 billion of our Class A common stock and dividend\npayments were $1.27 billion.\n• Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were\n$58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $10.90 billion.\n• Headcount – Headcount was 70,799 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year.\n1\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a\n2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality\nLabs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product\ndevelopment efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure\ncosts will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated\nwith our expanded infrastructure footprint.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of\n$35-40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures\ngrowth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds\nin the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-\nlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the\nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our\nability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals\nand mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-\nparty policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as\nwell as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on\ncommunity growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our\nbrand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with\ngovernment actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries;\nlitigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with\nacquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market\nconditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could\ncause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at\ninvestor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is\nJuly 31, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be\nreasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future\nevents.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations\nof Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures:\nrevenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The\npresentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to,\nfinancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material\nlimitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be\ndifferent from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial\nperformance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary\nindependent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in\noperating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 using the prior\nyear's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful\nmetric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and\nequipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe\nthat these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business,\nregardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can\nprovide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow\nis not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please\nsee the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 39,071 $ 31,999 $ 75,527 $ 60,645\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue 7,308 5,945 13,948 12,054\nResearch and development 10,537 9,344 20,515 18,725\nMarketing and sales 2,721 3,154 5,285 6,198\nGeneral and administrative (1) 3,658 4,164 7,114 7,049\nTotal costs and expenses 24,224 22,607 46,862 44,026\nIncome from operations 14,847 9,392 28,665 16,619\nInterest and other income (expense), net 259 (99) 624 (19)\nIncome before provision for income taxes 15,106 9,293 29,289 16,600\nProvision for income taxes 1,641 1,505 3,455 3,102\nNet income $ 13,465 $ 7,788 $ 25,834 $ 13,498\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 5.31 $ 3.03 $ 10.17 $ 5.24\nDiluted $ 5.16 $ 2.98 $ 9.86 $ 5.18\nWeighted-average shares used to compute earnings\nper share:\nBasic 2,534 2,568 2,540 2,577\nDiluted 2,610 2,612 2,619 2,604\n____________________________________\n(1) The second quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses include a charge for the recent settlement with the State of Texas.

Our calculations of DAP rely upon\ncomplex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products\nwhen we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are\ncalibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. For additional information, see \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" located in the Appendix of this presentation. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated\nour Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022. Beginning in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\n10\nFamily Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)\n$12.33\n$11.89\n$11.20\n$10.93\n$10.68\n$10.42\n$9.87\n$9.44 $9.47\nQ2'22 Q3'22 Q4'22 Q1'23 Q2'23 Q3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, we define average revenue per person (ARPP) as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter.

Some of the limitations of FCF are: (i) FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, and (ii) other companies in our industry present similarly titled\nmeasures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n15\nLimitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\nFamily Metrics\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP)\nand average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp\n(collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage\nof our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to\nalgorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in\nour methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their\naccuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the\nerror margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges\nin measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable\nonline and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family\nmetrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family\nmetrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier\nor link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these\nmetrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These\ntechniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We\nestimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for\nour Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple\nuser accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or\ntrends.\n16\nLimitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated\nagainst user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and\nacross multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys\nhave in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals\nfrom WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to\ndata signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of\nFamily metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user\nsurveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are\nintended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the first quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted\nsolely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example,\nwe look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into\nWhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the\npercentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of\nviolating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nUser Geography\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by\ndata limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP\naddress and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the\nlocation of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other\ntechnical errors.\n17\nMeta Earnings Presentation\nQ2 2024\ninvestor.fb.com"

          "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call\nJuly 31st, 2024\nKenneth Dorell, Director, Investor Relations\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms second quarter 2024 earnings\nconference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li,\nCFO.\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today\nwill include forward‐looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those\ncontemplated by these forward‐looking statements.\nFactors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s earnings press\nrelease, and in our quarterly report on form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward‐looking\nstatements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no\nobligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non‐GAAP financial measures. A\nreconciliation of GAAP to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The\nearnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.fb.com.\nAnd now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO\nThanks Ken. And hey everyone -- thanks for joining today.\nThis was a strong quarter for our community and business. We estimate that there are now more\nthan 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day. The growth we're seeing here in the\nUS has especially been a bright spot. WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly actives\nin the US, and we're seeing good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads\nas well -- both in the US and globally.\nI'm particularly pleased with the progress that we're making with young adults on Facebook. The\nnumbers we're seeing, especially in the US, really go against the public narrative around who's\nusing the app. A couple of years ago we started focusing our apps more on 18-29 year olds, and\nit's good to see that those efforts are driving good results.\nAnother bright spot is Threads, which is about to hit 200 million monthly actives. We're making\nsteady progress towards building what looks like it’s going to be another major social app. We're\nseeing deeper engagement and I'm quite pleased with the trajectory here.\nThe big theme right now is of course AI, and I'll focus my comments today on three areas: what AI\nmeans for our family of apps and core business, what new AI experiences and opportunities we\nsee, and how AI is shaping our metaverse work.\n1\nSo, let’s start: across Facebook and Instagram, advances in AI continue to improve the quality of\nrecommendations and drive engagement. We keep finding that as we develop more general\nrecommendation models, content recommendations get better. This quarter we rolled out our\nfull-screen video player and unified video recommendation service across Facebook -- bringing\nReels, longer videos, and Live into a single experience. This has allowed us to extend our unified AI\nsystems, which had already increased engagement on Facebook Reels more than our initial move\nfrom CPUs to GPUs did. Over time, I'd like to see us move towards a single, unified\nrecommendation system that powers all of the content including things like People You May\nKnow across all of our surfaces. We're not there, so there's still upside -- and we're making good\nprogress here.\nAI is also going to significantly evolve our services for advertisers in some exciting ways. It used to\nbe that advertisers came to us with a specific audience they wanted to reach -- like a certain age\ngroup, geography, or interests. Eventually we got to the point where our ads system could better\npredict who would be interested than the advertisers could themselves. But today advertisers still\nneed to develop creative themselves. In the coming years, AI will be able to generate creative for\nadvertisers as well -- and will also be able to personalize it as people see it. Over the long term,\nadvertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we're going\nto go do the rest for them. We're going to get there incrementally over time, but I think this is\ngoing to be a very big deal.\nMoving onto some of the brand new experiences that AI enables, last quarter we started broadly\nrolling out our assistant, Meta AI, and it is on track to achieve our goal of becoming the most used\nAI assistant by the end of the year. We have an exciting roadmap ahead of things that we want to\nadd, but the bottom line here is that Meta AI feels on track to be an important service and it's\nimproving quickly both in intelligence and features. Some of the use cases are utilitarian, like\nsearching for information or role-playing difficult conversations before you have them with\nanother person, and other uses are more creative, like the new Imagine Yourself feature that lets\nyou create images of yourself doing whatever you want in whatever style you want. And part of\nthe beauty of AI is that it's general, so we're still uncovering the wide range of use cases that it's\nvaluable for.\nAn important part of our vision is that we're not just creating a single AI, but enabling lots of\npeople to create their own AIs. This week we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to\ninteract with across our apps. I think that creators are especially going to find this quite valuable.\nThere are millions of creators across our apps -- and these are people who want to engage more\nwith their communities and their communities want to engage more with them -- but there are\nonly so many hours in the day. So now they’re going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents\nthat can channel them to chat with their community, answer people’s questions, create content,\nand more. So I'm quite excited about this. But this goes beyond creators too. Anyone is going to\nbe able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be\nable to engage with or share with their friends.\nBusiness AIs are the other big piece here. We're still in alpha testing with more and more\nbusinesses. The feedback we're getting is positive so far. Over time I think that just like every\nbusiness has a website, a social media presence, and an email address, in the future I think that\nevery business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with. Our goal is\nto make it easy for every small business, and eventually every business, to pull all of their content\nand catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money. When this is working at\nscale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue.\n2\nThere are a lot of other new opportunities here that I'm excited about too, but I'll save those for\nanother day when we're ready to roll them out.\nThe engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models. This\nquarter we released Llama 3.1, which includes the first frontier-level open source model, as well as\nnew and industry-leading small and medium-sized models. The 405B model has better cost\nperformance relative to the leading closed models, and because it's open, it is immediately the\nbest choice for fine-tuning and distilling your own custom models of whatever size you need. I\nthink we're going to look back at Llama 3.1 as an inflection point in the industry where open source\nAI started to become the industry standard, just like Linux is.\nI often get asked why I'm so bullish on open source. I wrote a letter along with the Llama 3.1\nrelease explaining why I believe that open source is better for developers, for Meta, and for the\nworld more broadly. My view is that open source will be safer, will enable innovation that improves\nall of our lives faster, and will also create more shared prosperity.\nFor Meta's own interests, we're in the business of building the best consumer and advertiser\nexperiences. To do that, we need to have access to the leading technology infrastructure and not\nget constrained by what competitors will let us do. But these models are ecosystems, they’re not\njust isolated pieces of software that we can develop by ourselves. So if we want the most robust\necosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations to\ndevelop around our models, then we need them to be widely used by developers across the\nindustry. Once we know that we’re going to have access to the leading models, then I am\nconfident that we’re going to be able to build the best social and advertising experiences.\nPart of why I'm so optimistic about this is that we have a long track record of success with open\nsource. We've saved billions of dollars with Open Compute Project by having supply chains\nstandardize on our infra designs. Open sourcing tools like PyTorch and React has led to real\nbenefits for us from all of the industry's contributions. This approach has consistently worked for\nus, and I expect it will work here too.\nAnother major area of focus is figuring out the right level of infra capacity to support training more\nand more advanced models. Llama 3 is already competitive with the most advanced models, and\nwe're already starting to work on Llama 4, which we're aiming to be the most advanced in the\nindustry next year. We're planning for the compute clusters and data we'll need for the next\nseveral years. The amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than\nwhat we used to train Llama 3 -- and future models will continue to grow beyond that. It's hard to\npredict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk\nbuilding capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up\nnew infra projects. And as we scale these investments, we're of course going to remain committed\nto operational efficiency across the company.\nThe last area that I want to discuss is how AI is shaping our metaverse work, which continues to be\nour other long-term focus. Last quarter I discussed how advances in AI have pulled in the timelines\nfor some of our products. A few years ago I would have predicted that holographic AR would be\npossible before smart AI, but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the\nopposite order. We're well-positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments that we've\nalready made.\n3\nRay-Ban Meta glasses continue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected -- thanks in part to AI.\nDemand is still outpacing our ability to build them, but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to meet that\ndemand soon. EssilorLuxottica has been a great partner to work with on this, and we're excited to\nteam up with them to build future generations of AI glasses as we continue to build our long term\npartnership.\nQuest 3 sales are also outpacing our expectations -- and I think that's because it's not just the best\nMR headset for the price, but it’s the best headset on the market, period. In addition to gaming,\npeople are increasingly taking advantage of Quest's capabilities as a general computing platform,\nspending time watching videos, browsing websites, extending their PC via virtual desktop, and\nmore. Horizon also continues to grow across VR, mobile, and desktop -- and I expect that it will\nbecome an increasingly important part of that ecosystem as well.\nWe're hosting our annual Connect conference on September 25, and we'll have lots of exciting\nupdates around all of our AI and metaverse work -- so I encourage you to tune in to that.\nAt the end of the day, we are in the fortunate position where the strong results we're seeing in our\ncore products and business gives us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future --\nand I plan to fully seize that opportunity to build some amazing things that will pay off for our\ncommunity and our investors for decades to come. The progress we're making on both the\nfoundational technology and product experiences suggests that we're on the right track. I'm\nproud of what our team has accomplished so far and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on\nthe opportunities ahead. As always, thank you to our teams who are pushing all of this important\nwork forward, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now, here's Susan.\nSusan Li, CFO\nThanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.\nLet’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless\notherwise noted.\nQ2 total revenue was $39.1 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis.\nQ2 total expenses were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to last year.\nIn terms of the specific line items:\nCost of revenue increased 23%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure and Reality Labs\ninventory costs.\nR&D increased 13%, primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure\ncosts, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\nMarketing & Sales decreased 14%, due mainly to lower restructuring and headcount-related costs.\nG&A decreased 12%, mostly due to lower legal-related expenses.\nWe ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from Q1.\n4\nSecond quarter operating income was $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 11%.\nNet income was $13.5 billion or $5.16 per share.\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.5 billion, driven by\ninvestments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.\nFree cash flow was $10.9 billion. We repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and\npaid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and\nmarketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.\nMoving now to our segment results.\nI’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.\nOur community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.27 billion\npeople using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June.\nQ2 Total Family of Apps revenue was $38.7 billion, up 22% year over year.\nQ2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $38.3 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis.\nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year\ngrowth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media.\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 33%\nand 26%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 20% and North America grew 17%. On an advertiser\ngeography basis, total revenue growth continued to be strongest in Asia-Pacific at 28%, though\ngrowth was below the first quarter rate of 41% as we lapped a period of stronger demand from\nChina-based advertisers.\nIn Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services and the average price per ad\nboth increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World.\nPricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad\nperformance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing\nregions and surfaces.\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $389 million, up 73%, driven primarily by business messaging\nrevenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.\nWe continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of\nour Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $19.4 billion, representing approximately\n80% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 4%, mostly due to higher\ninfrastructure and headcount-related expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring\ncosts.\nFamily of Apps operating income was $19.3 billion, representing a 50% operating margin.\n5\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $353 million, up 28% driven primarily by Quest\nheadset sales.\nReality Labs expenses were $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year driven mainly by higher\nheadcount-related expenses and Reality Labs inventory costs.\nReality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion.\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue\nperformance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness\nat monetizing that engagement over time.\nTo deliver engaging experiences, we remain focused on executing our priorities, including video\nand in-feed recommendations.\nOn Instagram, Reels engagement continues to grow as we make ongoing enhancements to our\nrecommendations systems. Part of this work has been focused on increasing the share of original\nposts within recommendations so people can discover the best of Instagram, including content\nfrom emerging creators. Now, more than half of recommendations in the US come from original\nposts.\nOn Facebook, we are seeing encouraging early results from the global roll-out of our unified video\nplayer and ranking systems in June. This initiative allows us to bring all video types on Facebook\ninto one viewing experience, which we expect will unlock additional growth opportunities for\nshort-form video as we increasingly mix shorter videos into the overall base of Facebook video\nengagement. We expect the relevance of video recommendations will continue to increase as we\nbenefit from unifying video ranking across Facebook and integrating our next generation\nrecommendation systems. These have already shown promising gains since we began using the\nnew systems to support Facebook Reels recommendations last year. We expect to expand these\nnew systems to support more surfaces beyond Facebook video over the course of this year and\nnext year.\nWe’re also seeing good momentum with our longer-term engagement priorities, including\nGenerative AI and Threads.\nPeople have used Meta AI for billions of queries since we first introduced it. We’re seeing\nparticularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has\ncoincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage. You can now use Meta AI in\nover 20 countries and eight languages, and in the US we’re rolling out new features like Imagine\nedit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI.\nBeyond generative AI, the Threads community also continues to grow and deepen their\nengagement as we ship new features and enhance our content recommendation systems.\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. There\nare two parts to this work.\nThe first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to see\nopportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces like video, including within\nFacebook as the mix of overall video engagement shifts more to shorter videos over time, which\n6\ncreates more ad insertion opportunities. More broadly, we are continuing to get better at\ndetermining the best ads to show and when to show them during a person’s session across both\nFacebook and Instagram. This is enabling us to drive revenue growth and conversions without\nincreasing the number of ads or in some cases even reducing ad load.\nThe second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. We\ncontinue to be pleased with progress here, with AI playing an increasingly central role.\nWe’re improving ad delivery by adopting more sophisticated modeling techniques made possible\nby AI advancements, including our Meta Lattice ad ranking architecture, which continued to\nprovide ad performance and efficiency gains in the second quarter.\nWe’re also making it easier for advertisers to maximize ad performance and automate more of\ntheir campaign set up with our Advantage+ suite of solutions. We’re seeing these tools continue\nto unlock performance gains, with a study conducted this year demonstrating 22% higher return\non ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns. Advertiser\nadoption of these tools continues to expand, and we’re adding new capabilities to make them\neven more useful.\nFor example, this quarter we introduced Flexible Format to Advantage+ Shopping, which allows\nadvertisers to upload multiple images and videos in a single ad that we can select from and\nautomatically determine which format to serve, in order to yield the best performance.\nWe have also now expanded the list of conversions that businesses can optimize for using\nAdvantage+ Shopping to include an additional 10 conversion types, including objectives like “add\nto cart”.\nLooking forward, we believe generative AI will play a growing role in how businesses market and\nengage with customers at scale.\nWe expect this technology will continue to make it easier for businesses to develop customized\nand diverse ad creative. We’ve seen promising early results since introducing our first generative\nAI ad features – image expansion, background generation, and text generation - with more than\none million advertisers using at least one of these solutions in the past month. In May, we began\nrolling out full image generation capabilities into Advantage+ creative, and we’re already seeing\nimproved performance from advertisers using the tool.\nFinally, we expect AI will help businesses communicate with customers more efficiently through\nmessaging. We’re starting by testing the ability for businesses to use AI in their chats with\ncustomers to help sell their goods and services and to generate leads. While we are in the early\nstages, we continue to expand the number of advertisers we’re testing with and have seen good\nadvances in the quality of responses since we began using Llama 3.\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. We\ncontinue to invest both in enhancing our core experiences in the near-term and developing\ntechnologies that we believe will transform how people engage with our services in the years\nahead. We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these\nopportunities, so we are investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support our core AI work, in\ncontent ranking and ads, as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts.\n7\nOur ongoing investment in core AI capacity is informed by the strong returns we’ve seen, and\nexpect to deliver in the future, as we advance the relevance of recommended content and ads on\nour platforms. While we expect the returns from generative AI to come in over a longer period of\ntime, we are mapping these investments against the significant monetization opportunities that\nwe expect to be unlocked across customized ad creative, business messaging, a leading AI\nassistant, and organic content generation.\nAs we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we will continue to\nbuild our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This\nwill allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference, or to our core ranking and\nrecommendation work when we expect that doing so would be more valuable. We will also\ncontinue our focus on improving the cost efficiency of our workloads over time.\nReality Labs remains our other long-term initiative that we continue to invest meaningfully in.\nQuest 3 is selling well and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are showing very promising traction, with\nthe early signals that we are seeing across demand, usage, and retention increasing our\nconfidence in the long-run potential of AR glasses.\nFinally, as we pursue these investments across near- and long-term priorities, we will remain\nfocused on operating the business efficiently.\nTurning now to the revenue outlook.\nWe expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion. Our guidance\nassumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on\ncurrent exchange rates.\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of\n$96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024\noperating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product\ndevelopment efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call,\nwe expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we\nrecognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.\nTurning now to the capex outlook. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in\nthe range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion. While we continue to\nrefine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capex growth in 2025 as we invest to\nsupport our AI research and our product development efforts.\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in\nthe mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal\nand regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and\nour financial results.\n8\nIn closing, Q2 was another good quarter. We continue to execute well across our business\npriorities and have exciting opportunities in front of us to deliver more value to the people and\nbusinesses using our products around the world.\nWith that, Krista, let’s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be -- open the lines for a question and answer session.\nTo ask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw\nyour question, again press star one. And please limit yourself to one question.\nPlease pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If\nyou are streaming today’s call, please mute your computer speakers. And your\nfirst question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Please\ngo ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thanks for taking my question. I have two, one for Mark, one for Susan.\nMark, I wanted to sort of go back to some of the new generative AI-enabled use\ncases for users and advertisers. You talked about Meta AI, Studio, chatbots,\ndiffusion models.\nIf you could just sort of hone in on one or two of those that you're most excited\nabout, we're seeing good signal that could be a real driver for the business in\n'25, '26 just so we sort of know where are you most focused on all those\nopportunities, it'd be helpful. And the second one, Susan, you have a lot of\nCapEx priorities from building new infrastructure for next-generation models,\ncompute capacity.\nJust walk us through again on the CapEx philosophy and any guardrails you\nhave around ensuring you generate a healthy return on invested capital for\ninvestors from all the CapEx. Thanks.\nMark Zuckerberg: I can take the first one. So I think the things that will drive the most results in\n'25 and '26 are actually the first category of things that I talked about in my\ncomments, which are the ways that AI is shaping the existing products.\nSo the ways that it's improving recommendations and helping people find\nbetter content as well as making the advertising experiences more effective. I\nthink there's a lot of upside there. Those are already products that are at scale.\nThe AI work that we're doing is going to improve that.\nIt will improve the experience and the business results. The other areas that\nwe're working on, I mean I think you all know this from following our business\nfor a while, but we have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new\nproduct, scaling it to something that reaches a billion people or more and only\nthen really focusing on monetizing at scale.\nSo realistically, for things like Meta AI or AI Studio, I mean these are things that\nI think will increase engagement in our products and have other benefits that\nwill improve the business and engagement in the near term.\n9\nBut before we're really talking about monetization of any of those things by\nthemselves, I mean I don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would\nexpect that that will be years, right?\nIt's just -- I think that that's like what we've seen with Reels. It's what we saw\nwith all these things.\nBut I think for those who have followed our business for a long time, you can\nalso get a pretty good sense of when things are going to work years in advance.\nAnd I think that the people who bet on those early indicators tend to do pretty\nwell which is why I wanted to share in my comments the early indicator that we\nhad on Meta AI, which is, I mean look, it's early. Last quarter, we -- I think it just\nstarted rolling it out a week or two before our earnings call.\nThis time, we're a few months later. And what we can say is I think we are on\ntrack to achieve our goal of being the most used AI assistant by the end of this\nyear. And I think that's a pretty big deal.\nIs that the only thing we want to do? No. I mean we obviously want to kind of\ngrow that and grow the engagement on that to be a lot deeper, and then we'll\nfocus on monetizing it over time.\nBut the early signals on this are good, and I think that that's kind of all that we\ncould reasonably have insight into at this point. But I do think that part of\nwhat's so fundamental about AI is it's going to end up affecting almost every\nproduct that we have in some way.\nIt will improve the existing ones and will make a whole lot of new ones possible.\nSo it's why there are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these\nearnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time. It's because it's actually\nsuper exciting, and it's going to change all these different things over multiple\ntime horizons.\nSusan Li: And Brian, I can take the second question. On the ROI part of your question, I\nwould broadly characterize our AI investments into two buckets, core AI and\ngen AI. And the two are really at different stages as it relates to driving revenue\nfor our businesses and our ability to measure returns.\nOn our core AI work, we continue to take a very ROI-based approach to our\ninvestment here. We're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both\nengagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains, and it\nmakes sense for us to continue investing here.\nGen AI is where we're much earlier, as Mark just mentioned in his comments.\nWe don't expect our gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in\n'24.\nBut we do expect that they're going to open up new revenue opportunities\nover time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment\nwhile we're also open sourcing subsequent generations of Llama.\n10\nAnd we've talked about the four primary areas that we're focused here on the\ngen AI opportunities -- to enhance the core ads business, to help us grow in\nbusiness messaging, the opportunities around Meta AI, and the opportunities\nto grow core engagement over time. The other thing I would say is, we're\ncontinuing to build our AI infrastructure with fungibility in mind so that we can\nflex capacity where we think it will be put to best use.\nThe infrastructure that we build for gen AI training can also be used for gen AI\ninference. We can also use it for ranking and recommendations by making\ncertain modifications like adding general compute and storage. And we're also\nemploying a strategy of staging our data center sites at various phases of\ndevelopment, which allows us to flex up to meet more demand and less lead\ntime if needed while limiting how much spend we're committing to in the outer\nyears.\nSo while we do expect that we are going to grow CapEx significantly in 2025,\nwe feel like we have a good framework in place in terms of thinking about\nwhere the opportunities are and making sure that we have the flexibility to\ndeploy it as makes the most sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please\ngo ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, hi thanks for taking the question. Just as we look at the revenue guidance\nand the outlook, Susan, any color you can share on just kind of the state of the\noverall digital ad market? And you've highlighted some areas where you're\nseeing strength versus kind of some of the idiosyncratic efforts you've made to\nkind of improve the efficacy of the ad product. Thank you.\nSusan Li: Hi, Mark. We're continuing to see healthy global advertising demand, and we're\nalso delivering ongoing ad performance improvements just related to all of the\ninvestments that we've continued to make over time, and improving the sort of\nads, targeting, ranking, delivery, all of the fundamental infrastructure there.\nAnd we expect that all of that will continue to benefit ad spend in Q3.\nWe do expect year-over-year growth to slow in Q3 as we are lapping strong\ngrowth from China-based advertisers as well as strong Reels impression\ngrowth from a year ago. And we also expect modestly larger FX headwinds in\nQ3 based on current rates.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nPlease go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. I'll just ask one. You called out\nbuilding community size and what's happened in the United States as well as\nThreads. How are you thinking about those newer, faster-growing elements of\neither Messaging or Threads as a platform and the mix between the potential\nfor engagement growth and overall monetization longer term of either the\nmessaging layer or Threads and what you're most excited about there to build\n11\nto sort of capitalize on scale but bring it back towards monetization? Thank\nyou.\nMark Zuckerberg: I can start, and Susan can jump in if she has anything else that she wants to\nadd. So the WhatsApp stat, I think, is really important as a business trend just\nbecause the United States punches above its weight in terms of, it's such a\nlarge percent of our revenue.\nSo before, WhatsApp was sort of the leading messaging app in many countries\naround the world but not in the U.S. And I think now that we're starting to make\ninroads into leading in the U.S. as more and more people use the product and\nrealize that, hey, this is a really good experience, it’s the best experience for\ncross-platform communication and groups and on all these different things, I\nthink that that's going to just mean that all of the work that we're doing to\ngrow the business opportunity there over time is just going to have a big\ntailwind if the U.S. ends up being a big market. So I think that that's one reason\nwhy it's really relevant.\nIt's obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around\nus starting to use WhatsApp, so I think that's pretty fun but maybe somewhat\nless relevant from a business perspective. Threads, I think it's another example\nof something that it got off to about as good of a start of any app that I can\nthink of. I think it was the fastest-growing app to 100 million people.\nAnd it's a good reminder that even when you have that start, the path from\nthere to 1 billion people using an app is still multiple years. And that's our\nproduct cycle. And I think that that's something that is a little bit different\nabout Meta in the way we build consumer products and then business around\nthem than a lot of other companies that ship something and start selling it and\nmaking revenue from it immediately.\nSo I think that's something that our investors and folks thinking about\nanalyzing the business, if needed, to always grapple with is all these new\nproducts, we ship them and then there's a multiyear time horizon between\nscaling them and then scaling them into not just consumer experiences but\nvery large businesses.\nBut the thing that I think is just super exciting about Threads is that we've been\nbuilding this company for 20 years, and there are just not that many\nopportunities that come around to grow a billion-person app.\nI mean there are, I don't know maybe a dozen of them in the world or\nsomething, right? I mean there are certainly more of them outside the company\nthan inside the company, but we do pretty well and being able to add another\none to the portfolio if we execute really well on this is just really exciting to\nhave that potential.\nNow obviously there's a ton of work between now and there. I mean we're\nalmost at 200 million. So it's a really good milestone, I'm excited about that. A\nlot of work between this and it being a large part of the business.\n12\nBut I do think that these kind of opportunities are pretty rare and that's\nsomething that we're just really excited about. I think the team is doing great\nwork on it.\nSusan Li: Eric, I would just add to that in terms of nearer-term sources of impression\ngrowth, we really expect that video is going to remain a source of impression\ngrowth for us in the second half.\nOn Instagram, we expect Reels to continue to drive growth, while on Facebook,\nwe expect to grow overall video time while increasing the mix of short-form\nvideo, which creates more impression growth opportunities. And generally, we\nexpect continued community growth across our apps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.\nPlease go ahead.\nDouglas Anmuth: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. One for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, just in\nterms of infrastructure and CapEx, you've talked about currently building out\nnot just for Llama 3 and 4 but really out to 7 perhaps and then Llama 4, 10x the\ncompute required versus Llama 3. Just given how much you're building ahead,\nhow does that influence the shape of the CapEx curve over a multiyear period?\nAnd then Susan, if you could talk a little bit more about the 3Q outlook.\nI know you're talking about tougher comps, but at the same time, it really\nsuggests only a point of FX neutral decel at the high end. So just curious if\nthere's anything else you can point to more specifically that's driving the\nexpected strength here? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Doug. I can go ahead and talk about both of those. So your first\nquestion was sort of about the longer-term CapEx outlook. We haven't really\nshared an outlook sort of on the longer-term CapEx trajectory.\nIn part, infrastructure is an extraordinarily dynamic planning area for us right\nnow. We're continuing to work through what the scope of the gen AI roadmaps\nwill look like over that time.\nOur expectation, obviously again, is that we are going to significantly increase\nour investments in AI infrastructure next year, and we'll give further guidance\nas appropriate.\nBut we are building all of that CapEx, again with the factors in mind that I\ntalked about previously thinking about both how to build it flexibly so we can\ndeploy to core AI and gen AI use cases as needed and making sure that we both\nfeel good about the returns that we're seeing on the core AI investments,\nwhich we're able to measure more immediately.\nAnd then we feel good about the opportunities in the gen AI efforts. Your\nsecond question was about the Q3 revenue outlook. Again, I mentioned this\nearlier. We have seen healthy global advertising demand on our platform.\n13\nWe're delivering ongoing ad performance improvements, which again, we feel\nlike is the result of many, many quarters of effort that have accrued and will\ncontinue to accrue value to our platform. And we saw basically in Q2 where\nrevenue grew 22%, that there was broad-based strength across regions and\nverticals including particular strength among smaller advertisers, and we\nexpect that generally to continue into Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nPlease go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. I just want to get back to the comment on U.S. young adult\nuser growth, especially maybe on Facebook and Instagram. I know you made a\nbig change with Reels a couple of years ago. But what are those users doing on\nFacebook and Instagram? And can you give us any quantification of the usage\ngrowth?\nSusan Li: Thanks, Justin. So building products with young adults in mind has been a core\npriority area for the Facebook team in recent years, and we've been very\nencouraged to see these efforts translate into engagement growth with this\ncohort.\nWe've seen healthy growth in young adult app usage in the U.S. and Canada for\nthe past several quarters. And we've seen that products like Groups and\nMarketplace have seen particular traction with young adults.\nPosting to groups in the U.S. and Canada has been growing. That's been\nboosted mainly by young adults. And we also see that they are active users of\nMarketplace, which has benefited from product improvements and strong\ndemand for secondhand products in the U.S.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nPlease go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Yeah, I was going to ask about Marketplace so that's a nice segue. It's a great,\nsomewhat undermonetized or arguably very under-monetized asset. I know\nyou indirectly monetize it and it's a very large marketplace.\nIt may even be bigger than eBay. Your thoughts on what you may want to do in\nthe future in terms of monetizing it, in part, maybe even improve the quality of\nthe Marketplace. And then secondly, I just want to ask you about headcount.\nIt's down about 1% year-over-year. You're pretty much back at par with where\nthe employee headcount was prior to significant reduction. How should we\nthink about headcount growth going forward? You talked about a significant\ngrowth in CapEx.\nShould we expect a moderate growth in headcount? Significant? Any thoughts\non that would be helpful.\n14\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark. On your first question about Marketplace, again, we're obviously\nexcited that it's been one of the drivers of strength in young adults.\nI would probably just say that more generally, Marketplace is one prong in a\nbroader commerce strategy that we have, which continues to be focused on\nbasically creating the best shopping experience on our platform. Marketplace is\nobviously consumer-oriented. The broader part of the commerce strategy is\nabout making it easier for businesses to advertise their products, for buyers to\nfind and purchase relevant items on our platform.\nAnd to that end, I would say that we feel quite happy with also the investments\nwe've been making in Shops ads. Shops ads revenue is growing at a strong\nyear-over-year pace.\nWe're seeing Shops ads drive incremental performance for advertisers, and it's\nalso working well in combination with some of our other products like\nAdvantage+ Shopping. Your second question was about headcount.\nWe continue to be disciplined about where we're allocating new headcount to\nensure that it's really focused on our core company priorities, but we're also\nworking down a prior hiring underrun.\nAnd as we further close that hiring underrun over the course of this year, I do\nexpect that we will end 2024 with in-seat reported headcount that is\nmeaningfully higher than where we ended 2023.\nWe aren't providing sort of 2025 headcount growth expectations yet as we\nhaven't started our budgeting process yet. But again, I expect that we will\nprimarily target our hiring to focus on priority areas, and we will be running a\nvery disciplined headcount process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist\nSecurities. Please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Great, thank you very much. So the AI assistant using Llama 3.1 has been\nincorporated in different variations and looks really impressive and seems to be\ngetting closer to becoming a full search engine for virtually everything except\nfor commercial queries so far.\nSo are there any plans to open it up to the broader web? Kind of like what\nmaybe OpenAI is alpha testing, maybe link it to third-party marketplaces for\ncommercial search, et cetera. And then on Ray-Ban, can you maybe talk a little\nbit more about the opportunity to deepen your relationship with\nEssilorLuxottica? What would that look like? What kind of areas are the most\nexciting to you, Mark, in that relationship? Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I'm very excited with how Llama 3.1 landed. I think the team there is doing\nreally great work going from the first version of Llama, to Llama 2 last year that\nwas a generation behind the frontier and now Llama 3.1, which is basically\ncompetitive and, in some ways, leading the other top closed models. Meta AI\n15\nuses a version of Llama 3.1 as well as a bunch of other services that we've built\nto kind of build a cohesive product.\nAnd when I was talking before about we have the initial usage trends around\nMeta AI but there's a lot more that we want to add, things like commerce and\nyou can just go vertical by vertical and build out specific functionality to make it\nuseful in all these different areas are eventually, I think, what we're going to\nneed to do to make this just as -- to fulfill the potential around just being the\nideal AI assistant for people.\nSo it's a long roadmap. I don't think that this stuff is going to get finished in the\nnext couple of quarters or anything like that. But this is part of what's going to\nhappen over the next few years as we build something that will, I think, just be a\nvery widely used service.\nSo I'm quite excited about that. And we're going to continue working on Llama,\ntoo. So I mean you mentioned Llama, and I think the question was a little more\nabout Meta AI but they're both -- I mean they're related. Llama is sort of like\nthe engine that powers the product and it's open source, and I'm just excited\nabout the progress that we're making on both of those.\nOn the smart glasses, EssilorLuxottica is a great partner. We are now in the\nsecond generation of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. They're doing well, better\nthan I think we had expected, and we expected them to grow meaningfully\nfrom the first generation so that's been a very positive surprise.\nAnd I think part of that is that it's just well positioned to dovetail well with the\nAI revolution that we're seeing and offering all kinds of new functionality there.\nSo that was great.\nBut EssilorLuxottica is a great company that has a lot of different products\nthat we hope to be able to partner with to just continue building new\ngenerations of the glasses and deepen the AI products and make it better and\nbetter.\nI think there's a lot more to go from here. And compared to what we thought at\nthis point, it's doing quite well. Compared to, I think, what it needs to be, to be\nlike a really leading piece of consumer electronics, I think we're still early but all\nthe signs are good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go\nahead.\nRonald Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to get back, Mark, to the\ncommentary on open source and Llama 3. Totally understand that Meta is not\noffering a public cloud, and so what I wanted to hear from you is maybe a little\nbit more on the product vision of products to come out of Llama 3.\nAnd meaning potentially offering some of these products to other companies,\ncall it, for customer service or call center offerings or other verticals. And so any\n16\ninsights on just how you envision maybe the open source and Llama 3.1 can\nsort of offer greater enterprise services for others to benefit from? Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: So Llama is the foundation model that people can shape into all kind of\ndifferent products.\nSo whether it's Meta AI for ourselves or the AI Studio or the business agents or\nlike the assistant that's in the Ray-Ban glasses, like all these different things are\nbasically products that have been built with Llama. And similarly, any developer\nout there is going to be able to take it and build a whole greater diversity of\ndifferent things as well.\nLike I talked about, I think -- the reason why open sourcing this is so valuable\nfor us is that we want to make sure that we have the leading infrastructure to\npower the consumer and business experiences that we're building. But the\ninfrastructure, it's not just a piece of software that we can build in isolation.\nIt really is an ecosystem with a lot of different capabilities that other\ndevelopers and people are adding to the mix, whether that's new tools to distill\nthe models into the size that you want for a custom model, or ways to fine-tune\nthings better or make inference more efficient or all different other kinds of\nmethods that we haven't even thought of yet, the silicon optimizations that the\nsilicon companies are doing, all the stuff.\nIt's an ecosystem. So we can't do all that ourselves. And if we built Llama and\njust kind of kept it within our walls, then it wouldn't actually be as valuable for\nus to build all the products that we're building as it's going to end up being.\nSo that's the business strategy around that. And that's why we don't feel like\nwe need to necessarily build a cloud and sell it directly in order for it to be a\nreally positive business strategy for us. And part of what we're doing is working\nclosely with AWS, I think, especially did great work for this release.\nOther companies like Databricks, NVIDIA, of course, other big players like\nMicrosoft with Azure, and Google Cloud, they're all supporting this. And we\nwant developers to be able to get it anywhere.\nI think that that's one of the advantages of an open source model like Llama is -\n- it's not like you're locked into one cloud that offers that model, whether it's\nMicrosoft with OpenAI or Google with Gemini or whatever it is, you can take\nthis and use it everywhere and we want to encourage that.\nSo I'm quite excited about that. The enterprise and business applications that\nwe're going to be most focused on, though, in addition to just optimizing the\nadvertiser experience like I talked about in my comments earlier, it is the\nbusiness agent piece.\nI just think that there's a huge potential like I said earlier. I think pretty much\nevery business today, it has an e-mail address. They have a website. They have\nsocial media accounts.\n17\nI think in the future, they're going to have at least one, if not multiple business\nagents that can do the whole range of things from interacting to help people\nbuy things to helping support the sales that they've done if they have issues\nwith the product, if they need to get in touch with you for something. And we\nalready see people interacting with businesses over messaging working quite\nwell in countries that have low cost of labor.\nBut the thing is that in order to have someone answering everyone's questions\nis quite expensive in a lot of countries. And I think that this is like a thing that AI,\nI think, is just going to be very well suited towards doing.\nAnd when we can make that easy for the hundreds of millions of businesses\nthat use our platforms to pull in all their information and their catalogs and the\nhistory and all the content that they've shared and really just quickly stand up\nan agent, I think that's going to be awesome.\nSo we can combine Llama with a lot of custom work that we're doing in our\nbusiness teams and couple that with all the other investment that the rest of\nthe ecosystem is doing to make Llama good. And I think that's going to be\nhuge, but that's just one area.\nI mean this really goes across all of the different products that we're building,\nboth consumer and business. So it's a lot of exciting stuff.\nKenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nPlease go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Great, Mark, so on Monday in your interview with Jensen, you said something\nalong the lines of if scaling ended up stopping one day, you'd have five years of\nproduct work to do and ahead of you.\nSo outside of agents or AI assistants, what other areas in AI are you thinking\nabout or looking at in that five-year roadmap? And then the second question is\nmaybe one more stab at the capacity question. You guys said that Llama 3.1\nwas trained on 16,000 H100s. You've also said that you're going to have\n600,000 available by year-end.\nSo even if we kind of go up to 160,000 GPUs for Llama 4, we have plenty of\nextra capacity for inference and future products. I guess how are you guys\nmodeling out this entire kind of CapEx roadmap between training, inference,\nand future things? That's all. Thanks a lot.\nMark Zuckerberg: I can start with the first one, and then I'll let Susan answer the second one. It's\nan interesting question. It's a little hypothetical because I mean I do think it's\ntrue that if, let's say, there were no future foundation models.\n18\nI think there would just be a huge amount of product innovation that the\nindustry would bring to bear, and that just takes time.\nBut then at the same time, there are going to be future foundation models, and\nthey're going to be awesome and unlock new capabilities and we're planning\nour products around those. So I'm not really planning our product roadmap\nassuming that there isn't future innovation.\nTo the contrary, we are planning what's going to be in Llama 4 and Llama 5 and\nbeyond based on what capabilities we think are going to be most important for\nthe roadmap that I just laid out, for having the breadth of utility that you're\ngoing to need in something like Meta AI, making it so that businesses and\ncreators and individuals can stand up any kind of AI agents that they want, that\nyou're going to have these kind of real-time, multimodal glasses with you all the\ntime that will just be increasingly useful for all the things that you're doing.\nAnd that -- I guess this kind of dovetails with what I'd expect Susan to talk\nabout next -- we do have this huge set of use cases already about people\nwanting to discover content and interact with their friends and businesses\nreaching people, and all that stuff is getting better with this, too.\nSo I -- there's -- I guess my point there was it's just -- there's some lag between\nthe technology becoming available and the products becoming kind of fully\nexplored in the space.\nAnd I just think that that was kind of my way of saying that I think that this is\njust a very exciting area where there's just going to be a lot of innovation for a\nlong time to come. I'll let Susan take a stab at the numbers around the GPUs\nand all that.\nSusan Li: Thank you. We are clearly in the process of building out a lot of capacity, and\nMark has alluded to that in his comments about what we have needed to train\nprior generations and the next generation of Llama.\nAnd we are -- and that's driving sort of what we've talked about in terms of the\nsignificant growth in CapEx in 2025. And we aren't really in the position now to\nshare a longer-term outlook. When we think about sort of any given new data\ncenter project that we're constructing, we think about how we will use it over\nthe life of the data center.\nWe think about the amount of capacity we would use in terms of training\nwhatever the subsequent generations of Llama are and it’s architected around\nthat.\nBut then we also look at how we might use it several years into its lifetime\ntowards other use cases across our core business, across what we think might\nbe future needs for inference, for generative AI-based products.\nSo there's sort of a whole host of use cases for the life of any individual data\ncenter ranging from gen AI training at its outset to potentially supporting gen\n19\nAI inference to being used for core ads and content ranking and\nrecommendation and also thinking through the implications, too, of what kinds\nof servers we might use to support those different types of use cases.\nSo we are really mapping across a wide range of potential use cases when we\nundertake any given project. And we're really doing that with both a long time\nhorizon in mind, again, because of the long lead times in spinning up data\ncenters, but also recognizing that there are multiple decision points in the\nlifetime of each data center in terms of thinking through when to order servers\nand what servers to order and what you'll put them towards.\nAnd that gives us flexibility to make the sort of the best decisions based on the\ninformation we have in the future.\nKenneth Dorell: Great. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look\nforward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure\nclarity. If you are streaming today’s call, please mute your computer speakers.\nAnd your first question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett\nNathanson. Please go ahead.\n1\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I just have two quick ones on cost view. In your answer on\nemployee headcount growth, you talk about a ramp in employee hiring. We've\nalready seen that come through the past couple quarters. Anyway, can you\nhelp us frame how you think about the normal level of headcount growth from\nthis point on?\nAnd then we talk about meaningful expansion of losses at Reality Labs. What\nare the factors that would contribute to that maybe change in the run rate\nwe've seen? Is depreciation a factor as you increase CapEx? Anything on the\nfactors driving Reality Lab losses would be helpful. Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Michael. On your first question -- coming into this year, we talked\nabout how we were basically working through a hiring underrun that was a\nresult of a prolonged hiring freeze that we had last year.\nAnd so that is the bulk of what you're seeing the hiring that has happened in\n2024 represent. so basically working through the hiring underrun is where the\nmajority of hiring is going now. We aren't giving guidance for 2025, in part\nbecause we haven't started our budget, but generally, our approach towards\nheadcount allocation is to really be taking a pretty ruthless look at, what places\nwe can we shift resources from -- areas that are sort of no longer particularly\ncritical or high priority, to the highest priority areas going into 2025.\nSo, I expect that we will be very focused in the parts of the company that are\ngrowing heads, and I expect we'll be pretty disciplined about the longer-term\nheadcount trajectory.\nOn your second question, we haven't updated any of the guidance on Reality\nLabs. I think we reiterated the prior guidance on Reality Labs. So, I don't think\nI said anything about a change in run rate. Our expectations for Reality Labs, of\ncourse encompass the full set of ambitions in the area, both our work in MR, in\nAR, in the Metaverse.\nSo we are investing really across a pretty broad array of efforts there. Within\nthat envelope, we are certainly seeing that we are shifting some energy\ntowards AR glasses in particular. I think the traction that we have seen with\nthe Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the product market fit and demand for the\nproduct out of the market, and the overlap with our AI efforts where the\nglasses form factor is really such an intuitive way to bring an AI assistant with\nyou around that sees what you see and hears what you hear. So, we're\ndefinitely trying to accelerate our glasses efforts in the Reality Lab space.\n2\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Please go\nahead.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions here. Susan, when you look at search\nresults on Meta AI, does that help you maybe improve commercial intent and\nrelevancy for your ad targeting? For example, I was thinking of maybe travel,\npeople searching for travel, people searching for local advertising, maybe\nlooking for a gym nearby.\nAnd secondly, and just to double-click on your prior statement about investing\nahead, but we'll also offset by increased efficiency, maybe help us understand\nthat approach a little bit. This approach here is to neutralize maybe high\ndepreciation expenses with high efficiency? Can you help us understand where\nyou are looking within the organization to lower your cost base? Thank you.\nSusan Li: Thanks, James. So, in terms of, the types of queries that we're seeing on Meta\nAI, we're seeing early signs that Meta AI is helping people leverage our apps for\na range of new use cases. We see that a lot of people are using Meta AI for\nlearning and information gathering type use cases, things like how-to advice,\nknowledge-based questions, writing assistance. We're also seeing a large\nnumber of people find value in using Meta AI for coaching.\nSo, there's a range of queries. We're pretty early in the journey with Meta AI\nand I think that, over the coming quarters, we are going to continue to iterate\non it. We're going to broaden availability to new languages and countries and\nthat's going to help us. We're going to ship new features and improvements,\nand that's going to help us make the Meta AI experience increasingly rich and\nengaging for people, which is really where our primary focus is right now.\nOn the second question about headcount -- being disciplined about the way\nthat we are thinking about allocating headcount. This is a place where we are\nreally trying to be very disciplined and ruthless about the way we are\nprioritizing in here, in part because it allows us to invest in infrastructure, which\nis just such a critical part of our AI ambitions right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\nPlease go ahead.\nKen Gawrelski: Thank you. Hi, Susan. Two questions, please. First, on the growth mix, it\nshifted more to pricing from just from impression growth. How should we\nthink about the balance between impression growth and pricing going forward\nand what does that mean for '25 and '26 growth drivers? Are you looking to\nachieve some kind of balance there?\n3\nAnd then maybe on the second, and this is more kind of an ecosystem question\non the AI side, is how far in Meta's view are we away from seeing a proliferation\nof third-party AI applications? We've seen some select AI applications mostly\nfrom the largest scale spenders today, but when do we see the ecosystem\nflourish like we did with mobile internet or desktop internet? Is this an element\nof time or is it capabilities on the model side? Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Ken. Taking your question in pieces. So, on the first question, the\ntrends in impression growth and price per ad growth are somewhat related\nbecause we are operating an auction.\nSo, the year-over-year growth in reported price per ad may have accelerated\nfrom Q1, but there's a lot that goes into that, not least of which are the auction\ndynamics that come from impression growth slowing down from Q1.\nNow one thing we keep a close eye on in order to understand the value that\nadvertisers are getting from their ads is the average cost per action, and that is\na complex metric for us because there are many different objectives that\nadvertisers optimize for and those different objectives can have quite different\nvalues depending on whether it's an app install or a web conversion, et cetera.\nBut overall, we feel good about the cost per action trends we're seeing. We\nthink that those are healthy. And as we continue to get better at driving\nconversions for advertisers, that will have the effect of lifting price per\nimpression over time because we're delivering more conversions per\nimpression served, meaning the impressions are higher value, which is the way\nthat I would frame it as opposed to impressions getting more expensive.\nAnd ultimately, driving conversions for advertisers is really what we are trying\nto do as opposed to, for example, optimize for a particular price or just drive\nimpressions independently of conversions.\nOn the second question, which is about the proliferation of third-party AI\napplications and when that will happen. It's clearly, I think, very early in the\ndevelopment of that ecosystem. But as Mark said, the pace of capability\ndevelopment is really what is getting ourselves and our peers excited, and just\nthe pace at which the models are advancing and then our ability to build on\nthose to create good tools for creators.\nAnd so, we announced that we're rolling out AI Studio in the U.S. That enables\npeople to create AI characters which are fully customizable and conversational\nAis. You can do it from a template, you can do it from scratch based on your\n4\npersonal interests. And then Creator AIs are extension of characters and\ncreators can build an AI within Instagram or on the web that can answer\ncommon DM type questions and Story replies and they can use that to connect\nwith their followers.\nSo, we're excited about the opportunity for both of those to become really\nuseful features and for a healthy and active Creator AI ecosystem to flourish on\ntop of the tools that we are building.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with New Street\nResearch. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Salmon: Okay, great. Good afternoon, everyone. Susan, your outlook comments\nobviously emphasize the growth of infrastructure-related costs in 2025. Could\nyou add a little bit of color on how that might impact different expense lines?\nWe assume that's mostly in cost of revenue, but maybe there's some in R&D as\nwell.\nAnd then any color on the balance of depreciation versus cash expenses that\nyou can add? Just love to hear any more that can help us out with the models\ntonight.\nSusan Li: Thank you, Dan, for the question. So, as it pertains to CapEx, one of the things I\nwant to be really clear about is we have seen significant growth this year in\nCapEx. We expect another year of significant growth in 2025. And, we are not\nin a position to quantify this yet, as I mentioned on the call, in part because the\ninfrastructure planning process is -- it's very dynamic.\nIn fact, when you are trying to build large training clusters and to land the\ncapacity that you need, you often end up spinning up multiple projects and\nparallel pathing multiple options because there are many reasons why one\noption or another will end up not becoming feasible in the process of trying to\nbuild capacity.\nSo, for us, a lot of the uncertainty in 2025 comes around evaluating those\nparallel paths and the fact that there's a lot of uncertainty about how each\nindividual path may pan out. But, again, we think, in all cases that we expect\nthat 2025 will be another year of significant CapEx growth.\nNow, to the specific question about how it might impact expense lines. It is\nboth in cost of revenue and R&D. The expenses that flow through R&D really\ncapture the depreciation and operating expenses of the infrastructure that is\nused to support AI research across the company. And then the expenses that\n5\nflow through cost of revenue really are more around supporting the sort of core\nads ranking and recommendation use cases.\nWe haven't really commented on the mix of depreciation versus cash expenses\nnext year. Obviously, depreciation is from the footprint that we've already built\nflowing through but we are also commencing new projects in '25 that will\nrequire cash outlays and then we'll end up depreciating through future year\nP&Ls.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital\nMarkets. Please go ahead.\nRob Sanderson: Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back and revisit\ncommentary you shared last quarter, or Mark was sharing last quarter, just on\nthe discussion for potential of revenue displacement as you invest in scaling up\nGenAI products. And I think the general interpretation was this was maybe a\nshift in AI capacity away from core AI into strategic AI, obviously core AI driving\nmonetization today, GenAI, no near-term monetization.\nSo, first, is that the correct interpretation? And if so, are you talking about a\nshift of allocation of new capacity or are we actually shifting some capacity\naway from core?\nAnd then second on that is, does the decision to delay training in the EU\nprovide any relief on capacity demands?\nSusan Li: Thanks, Rob. So, on the first question, clarifying the comments from last\nquarter. Our compute needs outstrip our available data center capacity right\nnow. Given the focus that we have on accelerating our GenAI efforts, the new\ncapacity that we've been bringing online is really going more towards GenAI\nthan towards other workloads.\nWe've also had to do a little bit of shifting capacity around to free up capacity\nfor GenAI training. And altogether, we expect that that will result in some\nforegone revenue growth from ads and organic content ranking improvements\nthat we would have otherwise made, but that has been factored into our Q3\noutlook. And we generally expect this to be to be a near term dynamic until we\nstart bringing additional data center capacity online next year, which will meet\nour capacity needs.\nOn your second question around the EU, we're working with regulators to\naddress their concerns, so we can develop and improve our AI products based\non the information that people choose to share on our platforms. I would say,\n6\ngenerally, I would expect training capacity to be a big driver of future CapEx\nneeds. I think that will be the case, regardless of how things progress in\nEurope.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe\nResearch. Please go ahead.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask about how -- if it\nis fair to think of the return, and you've been asked this question many different\nways, but if we think about the incremental revenue that's generated, expected\nto generate, call it next year or this year versus prior years, and the\nincrementality that we see attributed to AI, is that a good way of thinking\nabout the contribution of AI, or the return from your AI investments? Thank\nyou.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Shweta. I'm going to do my best to answer this question and let me\nknow if I didn't address the heart of it.\nSo, the incremental revenue that you see this year and largely next year,\ncoming from the ads business, that will primarily be a function of the\ninvestments that we have been making in the core AI work that goes into the\nongoing ads performance improvements as we make our ranking, delivery,\ntargeting, et cetera systems, more performant over time.\nWe are certainly investing in core AI as a part of the infrastructure growth next\nyear. At the same time, a lot of the CapEx that we are building next year is in\nservice of training foundation models for our GenAI efforts, where we are really\nmuch earlier, and we don't expect that to be a meaningful driver of revenue in\n'24 or '25.\nBut we expect that they will open up revenue opportunities in the future and\nwe've talked about some of those -- making the core ads business better by\nmaking ads increasingly personalized at scale, growing business messaging,\nparticularly in developed markets, obviously monetizing the consumer\nexperience that we hope to build with Meta AI, and then also making it easier to\ncreate content for core organic engagement. But again, those I think will all\nplay out over a longer period of time.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Please go\nahead.\n7\nStephen Ju: Hi Susan. So, I was pleasantly surprised to hear you talk about games and\nentertainment sectors as being one of the larger contributors to your growth\nhere, and I think this is a sector that's seen some tough times post-pandemic\nand even post-IDFA deprecation. So, what's changed from a product\nperspective that you've been able to revitalize spending from that segment?\nAnd digging in a little bit in terms of your commentary from the APAC-based\nadvertisers and what they're doing. I think a couple of quarters ago, you gave\nus all a sort of food for thought to really think beyond a larger e-commerce\nplatform. So, can you update us on the makeup of these advertisers and\nwhether the audience they are targeting has evolved over time? Thanks.\nChad Heaton: This is Chad. I can start with your first question. I'll start broadly about\nverticals. We saw a continued healthy year-over-year growth across verticals\nin Q2. We mentioned that came from online commerce, gaming, and\nentertainment and media. But the rate of growth did come down relative to Q1\nacross pretty much all the verticals.\nIn terms of gaming specifically, as I said, year-over-year growth remains strong\nbut decelerated in Q2. That was primarily driven by slower growth among\nChina-based advertisers. We don't have anything more specific in terms of\nproducts or features that launched. Again, more recently, it has been a vertical\nthat we've seen strength in. And we saw strength again in Q2.\nSusan Li: On your second question, Stephen, we shared previously that two-thirds of our\nChina ad revenue came from advertisers outside the top 10 spenders in China\nin 2023. I think that's the comment that you're referring to.\nWe don't have an update on that for this year, but I would say it continues to be\na diverse advertiser base. And more broadly, I think we are continuing to see a\nlonger-term trend of growth from China-based advertisers.\nAgain, there's obviously variability in growth rates period to period. There was\nclearly an impact, from COVID, but I think it's been over the last several years a\nstrong contributor to growth for us and we expect it to remain so. And again,\nmost of our China-based ad revenue continues to come from a longer tail of\nadvertisers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz with The\nBenchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Susan, two quick ones if I could. On the CapEx side of things, I'm\njust curious if you would contemplate managing free cash flow in the negative\n8\ngrowth territory next year to fulfill another big step up you've discussed in\nterms of investment?\nAnd then just a clarification on Reels inventory growth. You mentioned a\nhigher conversion of Reels ad units which would suggest lower growth in ad\nload here just going forward. But if you could just maybe balance that with a\ncomment on just short video in general offering more inventory units to sell, I\nguess what’s the messaging here in terms of next 12 months, if you will, growth\nin ad units here with Reels versus the last 12 months? Just trying to get, I\nguess, a picture there. Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark. I’ll take that first question. We haven’t really guided on free\ncash flow. Again, I would say there is a big range of CapEx outcomes that we’re\nworking through right now based on different data center options in different\nplaces. So, I think there’s a lot going on. It’s really a very dynamic planning area\nfor us right now and we’ll have more clarity on that at the Q4 call.\nChad Heaton: So, in terms of Reels inventory growth, I guess speaking broadly, we are in a\nperiod where say last year, we ramped Reels ad load pretty significantly. And\nso, we certainly don’t have opportunities in front of us to continue to increase\nad load at that rate.\nI would say at this point, with respect to Reels, we’re focusing on optimizing\nthe level of ads just by launching and testing new experiences for ads to deliver\nin Reels. One example of that would be back-to-back ads in Reels where in Q2\nwe started showing some ads more closely together in Instagram Reels,\nincluding back-to-back when we have more relevant and engaging ads to show.\nWe’re also, over on the Facebook side, we’re focused on video unification,\nwhere Facebook has a lot longer form video that monetizes at a lower rate than\nshort form. And so, we expect that mix of video shift more to short form over\ntime as part of that video unification works, which should benefit monetization\nefficiency of a video on Facebook.\nSo, we have a lower ad load still on Reels than we do, say, in Feed and Stories.\nThere are opportunities there as we look forward. But I wouldn’t expect them\nto be growing at the rate that they have historically.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Richard Greenfield with Lightshed.\nPlease go ahead.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. You haven’t updated us on number of\nadvertisers in a long time. I don’t know if you’re comfortable. I think the last\n9\ntime it was like 12 million. But regardless of what the actual number is, I\nwanted to just hone in on Mark’s commentary around the impact of AI to help\nadvertisers make content.\nObviously, video ads with AI isn’t ready yet. But I’m sure over the next 12 or 18\nmonths it will be. Is there any way you can give us a sense of how many of --\nwhat percentage even, of Meta’s advertisers today actually make video ads\nversus just static images or text? Just trying to understand how much it could\nchange the amount of advertisers and suppliers into your advertising funnel\nover the course of the next couple of years. Or anyway of thinking about that\nquestion or topic. Thanks.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Rich. We have not updated this, as you mentioned, and I don’t think\nwe’re sharing the number of advertisers who create video ads. Having said\nthat, I would emphasize Mark’s comments that we are really evolving our ads\nproducts and features to make it easier for advertisers to use a lot of the new\nGenAI-powered features that we’re building.\nWe’ve been very pleased with the reception of our GenAI ad creative tools so\nfar, we’ve seen good usage retention, performance games, even at the stage\nwe are today, which is very early, over a million advertisers actually used either\nimage expansion, background generation, or text variation in the past month,\nand we’re seeing particularly strong adoption of our image expansion feature,\nespecially among smaller online commerce advertisers. And we’re seeing,\nagain, improved performance gains from advertisers who are using these.\nSo we are focused on continuing to expand the capabilities of our existing\ncreative generation tools in the future. We want to introduce more interactive\nfeatures to help advertisers fine-tune images that they generate through text\nprompts, for example. We want to make it easier to incorporate brand input\nand to allow advertisers to optimize the ad creatives based on what advertisers\nfeel makes the ads unique to their brand, so working with them to better tailor\ntheir image and text generation capabilities to brand colors, logos, that sort of\nthing, and adding new formats.\nSo we’re very early here, I think there is a lot of work that we’ll be undertaking\nover the next years, frankly, to make it easier for advertisers to continue\ngenerating personalized at scale.\nKenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler with\nSeaport Research. Please go ahead.\n10\nAaron Kessler: Great, appreciate the last question. I had just a couple questions on the maybe\nFamily of Apps. think the growth slowed a little bit for the other category, just\nany updates on messaging revenues, et cetera? And just any more color on the\nlegal costs, if you can quantify that at all, in terms of the Q2 G&A? Thank you.\nChad Heaton: In terms of FoA growth, I think we’ve saw strong growth there. In terms of\nmessaging specifically, click to messaging continues to be a strong area of\ngrowth for us. I would say business messaging -- paid messaging also\ncontinues to grow nicely for us. So I don’t know that we have new stats to\nshare here but this continued to be a great area of growth for us in Q2.\nKenneth Dorell: Aaron, this is Ken. The one thing I would also add is that within that segment\nwe are lapping a pricing change with the business messaging product in June of\nlast year, so we started lapping that later in the quarter, and then we’re also\nlapping more of the broader roll-out of Meta Verified, so that’s contributing to\nthe results in Q2.\nAaron Kessler: Got it, that’s helpful. And then just anything on the legal costs?\nSusan Li: Yes, on the legal side. Our Q2 G&A expenses include the settlement with the\nstate of Texas, and so that has been fully accrued for. G&A expenses were\ndown 12% year over year since we also lapped large legal-related expenses\nfrom the second quarter of 2023.\nKenneth Dorell: Great. Well thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking to\nyou again soon.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation and\nyou may now disconnect.\n11"

(Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Meta \\(PRNewsfoto/Meta\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1673006/Meta_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1673006/Meta_Logo.html)\n\n\"We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"We also have strong momentum with Meta AI, Llama adoption, and AI-powered glasses.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024****Financial Highlights**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **% Change**  \n---|---  \n_In millions, except percentages and per share amounts_ | **2024** | **2023**  \nRevenue | $ 40,589 | $ 34,146 | 19 %  \nCosts and expenses | 23,239 | 20,398 | 14 %  \nIncome from operations | $ 17,350 | $ 13,748 | 26 %  \n_Operating margin_ | _43 %_ | _40 %_  \nProvision for income taxes | $ 2,134 | $ 2,437 | (12) %  \n_Effective tax rate_ | _12 %_ | _17 %_  \nNet income | $ 15,688 | $ 11,583 | 35 %  \nDiluted earnings per share (EPS) | $ 6.03 | $ 4.39 | 37 %  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024****Operational and Other Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Family daily active people (DAP)** – DAP was 3.29 billion on average for September 2024, an increase of 5% year-over-year.\n  * **Ad impressions** – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 7% year-over-year.\n  * **Average price per ad** – Average price per ad increased by 11% year-over-year.\n  * **Revenue** – Total revenue was $40.59 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\n  * **Costs and expenses** – Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\n  * **Capital expenditures** – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\n  * **Capital return program** – Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\n  * **Cash, cash****equivalents, and marketable securities** – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\n  * **Long-term debt** – Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\n  * **Headcount** – Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\n\n\n**CFO Outlook Commentary**\n\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem. \n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at [investor.fb.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4288699-1&h=516644425&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.fb.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&a=investor.fb.com) and on the SEC website at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4288699-1&h=1227490803&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov). Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 30, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\n_Foreign exchange effect on revenue_. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\n_Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases._ We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\n**META PLATFORMS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME**

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% year-over-year.\n  * **Costs and expenses** – Total costs and expenses were $24.22 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\n  * **Capital expenditures** – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.47 billion.\n  * **Capital return program** – Share repurchases were $6.32 billion of our Class A common stock and dividend payments were $1.27 billion.\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities** – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $10.90 billion.\n  * **Headcount** – Headcount was 70,799 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year.\n\n\n\n**CFO Outlook Commentary**\n\nWe expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at [investor.fb.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4221574-1&h=1224552136&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.fb.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&a=investor.fb.com) and on the SEC website at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4221574-1&h=521958770&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov). Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 31, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\n_Foreign exchange effect on revenue_. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\n_Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases._ We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\n**META PLATFORMS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME**  \n_(In millions, except per share amounts)_  \n_(Unaudited)_  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,** | **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Revenue** | $ 39,071 | $ 31,999 | $ 75,527 | $ 60,645  \n**Costs and expenses:**  \nCost of revenue | 7,308 | 5,945 | 13,948 | 12,054  \nResearch and development | 10,537 | 9,344 | 20,515 | 18,725  \nMarketing and sales | 2,721 | 3,154 | 5,285 | 6,198  \nGeneral and administrative (1) | 3,658 | 4,164 | 7,114 | 7,049  \n**Total costs and expenses** | 24,224 | 22,607 | 46,862 | 44,026  \n**Income from operations** | 14,847 | 9,392 | 28,665 | 16,619  \nInterest and other income (expense), net | 259 | (99) | 624 | (19)  \nIncome before provision for income taxes | 15,106 | 9,293 | 29,289 | 16,600  \nProvision for income taxes | 1,641 | 1,505 | 3,455 | 3,102  \n**Net income** | $ 13,465 | $ 7,788 | $ 25,834 | $ 13,498  \n**Earnings per share:**  \nBasic | $ 5.31 | $ 3.03 | $ 10.17 | $ 5.24  \nDiluted | $ 5.16 | $ 2.98 | $ 9.86 | $ 5.18  \n**Weighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share:**  \nBasic | 2,534 | 2,568 | 2,540 | 2,577  \nDiluted | 2,610 | 2,612 | 2,619 | 2,604  \n  \n(1) The second quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses include a charge for the recent settlement with the State of Texas.

As a company that operates platforms where public discourse takes place, Meta understands the responsibility it has to protect people’s ability to make their voices heard, and ensure we are prepared for the many elections around the world. \n\nSince 2016 we have been evolving our approach to elections to incorporate the lessons we learn and stay ahead of emerging threats. We have a dedicated team responsible for Meta’s cross-company election integrity efforts, which includes experts from our intelligence, data science, product and engineering, research, operations, content and public policy, and legal teams. In 2024, we ran a number of election operations centers around the world to monitor and react swiftly to issues that arose, including in relation to the major elections in the US, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, the EU Parliament, France, the UK, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nWith the US election in the books, we are in a position to share some of the trends we’ve seen on our platforms, and explain how we have sought to balance protecting people’s ability to express themselves with keeping people safe throughout the year.\n\n## Enabling Free Expression\n\nStriking the balance between allowing people to make their voices heard and keeping people safe is one that no platform will ever get right 100 per cent of the time. We know that when enforcing our policies, our error rates are too high, which gets in the way of the free expression we set out to enable. Too often harmless content gets taken down or restricted and too many people get penalized unfairly. Throughout the year we have sought to update and apply our content policies fairly so that people can make their voices heard, and we will continue to work on this in the months ahead.\n\n  * We launched political content controls on Facebook, Instagram and Threads to give people the ability to have more political content recommended to them if they want. These controls have launched in the US and are in the process of rolling out globally. \n  * We allow people to ask questions or raise concerns about election processes in organic content. However, we do not allow claims or speculation about election-related corruption, irregularities, or bias when combined with a signal that content is [threatening violence](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/violence-incitement/). We clarified our policies to make that distinction. For paid content, we [prohibit](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/253606115684173) ads that call into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election as we have since 2020.\n  * We updated our [penalties system](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/meta-is-improving-facebooks-penalty-system/) in early 2023 to make it fairer in protecting people’s ability to make their voices heard, while remaining effective at enforcing against people who persistently violate our policies.\n  * We conduct yearly audits of words we designate as slurs under our Hate Speech policy, prioritizing markets with upcoming elections, with the goal of maintaining up-to-date lists that protect vulnerable communities while ensuring we do not over-enforce on political discourse.\n  * We also [updated](https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts-by-public-figures/) our penalty protocol related to public figures suspended for violations during periods of civil unrest, updating the policy to help ensure Americans could hear from the candidates for President on the same basis. We committed to periodic reviews of whether enhanced penalties are warranted. \n\n\n\nThroughout elections around the world in 2024, we connected people with reliable information about voting through in-app notifications on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n  * During the 2024 US general election, top of feed reminders on Facebook and Instagram received more than 1 billion impressions. These reminders included information on registering to vote, voting by mail, voting early in person, and voting on election day. People clicked on these reminders more than 20 million times to visit official government websites for more information. \n  * We also work with state and local elections officials to send Voting Alerts, and have sent more than 765 million notifications on Facebook since 2020. This is a tool that can adapt as needed to changing situations on the ground – for example, if specific polling places needed extended hours on Election Day.\n  * We ran a Search Engine Results Page interstitial on Facebook and Instagram in the US, meaning when people searched for terms related to the 2024 elections they were shown links to official sources for information about how, when and where to vote. On Instagram we continued to elevate Story stickers directing people to official voting information. We also continued to run the Voting Information Center on Facebook.\n  * Top of feed notifications reached millions of people in countries holding elections around the world in 2024, including: \n    * In the UK, our Election Day Reminder reached 43.6 million people on Facebook and Instagram, with nearly 900,000 people clicking through to register to vote or check their registration status.\n    * In the EU, users engaged these notifications more than 41 million times on Facebook and more than 58 million times on Instagram.\n    * In India, where the Voting Alert notification ran on Facebook on April 17th ahead of the National Elections. The notification launched from the Election Commission of India’s Facebook page and reached 145 million users, directing people to get more information via [https://elections24.eci.gov.in/](https://elections24.eci.gov.in/). The Elections Commission of India also deployed the WhatsApp API to run voting reminder campaigns reaching around 400 million users. \n    * In local elections in Brazil, users engaged reminder notifications around 9.7 million times across Facebook and Instagram.\n    * In France, users clicked on these in-app notifications more than 599K times on Facebook and more than 496K times on Instagram.\n\n\n\nMeta also continues to offer industry-leading transparency for ads about social issues, elections and politics. Advertisers who run these ads are required to complete an authorization process and include a “paid for by” disclaimer. These ads are then stored in our publicly available [Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library) for seven years. This year, we continued to prohibit new political, electoral and social issue ads in the US during the final week of the election campaign as we have since 2020, because in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims. Since January 2024, in certain cases we’ve also required advertisers to disclose when they use AI or other digital techniques to create or alter a political or social issue ad. \n\n## Monitoring the Impact of AI\n\nAt the start of the year, many people were warning of the potential impact of generative AI on the upcoming elections, including the risk of widespread deepfakes and AI-enabled disinformation campaigns. From what we’ve monitored across our services, it seems these risks did not materialize in a significant way and that any such impact was modest and limited in scope.\n\n  * While there were instances of confirmed or suspected use of AI in this way, the volumes remained low and our existing policies and processes proved sufficient to reduce the risk around generative AI content. During the election period in the major elections listed above, ratings on AI content related to elections, politics and social topics represented less than 1% of all fact-checked misinformation.\n  * As part of our efforts to prevent people using Meta’s Imagine AI image generator to create election-related deepfakes, we rejected 590,000 requests to generate images of President-elect Trump, Vice President-elect Vance, Vice President Harris, Governor Walz, and President Biden in the month leading up to election day. \n  * We also closely monitored the potential use of generative AI by covert influence campaigns – what we call Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior (CIB) networks – and found they made only incremental productivity and content-generation gains using generative AI. This has not impeded our ability to disrupt these influence operations because we focus on behavior when we investigate and take down these campaigns, not on the content they post – whether created with AI or not. \n  * In the lead up to the US election, we required Meta AI to respond to questions about when and how to vote with links to authoritative sources that could offer the most up to date information. On Election Day, we also required Meta AI to respond to certain questions about the candidates and election results by directing people to check with authoritative sources until a winner was projected by multiple news organizations. \n  * Throughout 2024, we have cooperated with others in our industry to combat potential threats from the use of generative AI. For example, in February of 2024, we signed the [AI Elections Accord](https://securityconference.org/en/aielectionsaccord/) alongside dozens of other industry leaders, pledging to help prevent deceptive AI content from interfering with this year’s global elections. In India we launched a [WhatsApp tipline](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/02/mcas-whatsapp-helpline-curbing-the-spread-of-ai-generated-misinformation/) in partnership with the cross-industry Misinformation Combat Alliance, which included setting up a world-first Deepfakes Analysis Unit to provide assessments of any digital content in audio or video form that users suspected could be a deepfake. And ahead of the European Parliament Elections, Meta funded and supported the European Fact-Checking Standards Network (EFCSN) in a [project](https://efcsn.com/news/2024-04-18_efcsns-new-project-for-identifying-ai-generated-and-digitally-altered-content/) aimed at improving the skills and capabilities of the European fact-checkers in debunking and countering AI-generated misinformation.\n\n\n\n## Preventing Foreign Interference\n\nThis year, our teams have taken down around 20 new covert influence operations around the world, including in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and the US. \n\n  * Russia remains the number one source of the covert influence operations we’ve disrupted to date – with 39 networks disrupted in total since 2017. The next most frequent sources of foreign interference are Iran, with 31 CIB networks, and China, with 11.\n  * The majority of the CIB networks we’ve disrupted have struggled to build authentic audiences, and some used fake likes/followers to appear more popular than they were. For example, we took down a [CIB network](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/taking-action-against-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-in-moldova) originating primarily in the Transnistria region of Moldova, and targeting Russian-speaking audiences in Moldova. We removed this campaign before they were able to build authentic audiences on our apps.\n  * The vast majority of the CIB networks we disrupted globally tried to spread themselves across many online apps, including ours, YouTube, TikTok, X, Telegram, Reddit, Medium, Pinterest, and more. We’ve seen a number of influence operations shift much of their activities to platforms with fewer safeguards than ours. For example, fictitious videos about the US elections (assessed by the US intelligence community to be linked to Russian-based influence operations) were posted on X and Telegram rather than our apps. In a minimal number of instances where people in the US reposted this content on our apps, we labeled the content as reported to be linked to Russian influence actors.\n  * The vast majority of CIB networks ran their own websites, likely to withstand takedowns by any one company. The largest and most persistent such operation is known as Doppelganger, which uses a vast web of fake websites, including some spoofing legitimate news and government entities. We have created the largest public repository of Doppelganger’s threat signals, exposing over 6,000 domains since 2022, so that researchers and other investigative teams can also take action, in addition to blocking them from being shared on our apps. However, despite some disruptions by [governments](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-09/doppelganger_affidavit_9.4.24.pdf) and [others](https://therecord.media/european-web-hosting-companies-doppelganger-disinformation-shutdowns), many of Doppelganger’s web domains we have exposed to date have been quickly replaced and continue to post new content, and many of their brands remain active on X and Telegram. \n  * Ahead of the US election, Doppelganger struggled to get through on our apps and largely abandoned posting links to its websites. The vast majority of Doppelganger’s attempts to target the US in October and November were proactively stopped before any user saw their content.\n  * Ahead of the US elections, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. We banned Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities from our apps globally for violations of our policies prohibiting engaging in or claiming to engage in foreign interference. This followed the unprecedented [steps](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/metas-ongoing-efforts-regarding-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) we took over 2 years ago to limit the spread of Russian state controlled media, including blocking them from running ads, placing their content lower in people’s feeds, and adding in-product nudges that ask people to confirm they want to share or navigate to content from these outlets.\n\n\n\nThese findings and policies are intended to give you a sense of what we’ve seen and the broad approach we have taken during this unprecedented year of elections, but they are far from an exhaustive account of everything we did and saw. Nor is our approach inflexible. With every major election, we want to make sure we are learning the right lessons and staying ahead of potential threats. Striking the balance between free expression and security is a constant and evolving challenge. As we take stock of what we’ve learned during this remarkable year, we will keep our policies under review and announce any changes in the months ahead.\n\nCategories\n\n: \n\n[Election Integrity](https://about.fb.com/news/category/election-integrity/ ) [Integrity and Security](https://about.fb.com/news/category/integrity-security/ ) [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/meta/ ) [Public Policy](https://about.fb.com/news/category/public-policy/ ) [Safety and Expression](https://about.fb.com/news/category/safety-and-expression/ )\n\nTags: \n\n[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/) [Combating Misinformation](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/misinformation/) [Community Standards and Enforcement](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/community-standards-and-enforcement/) [Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/) [Elections](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/elections/) [Safety](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/safety/)\n\n## Related News\n\nMeta \n\n### [How Meta Is Preparing for the 2024 South African Elections](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/how-meta-is-preparing-for-the-2024-south-african-elections/)\n\nOur team is developing a tailored approach to help preserve the integrity of the South African elections on our platforms. \n\nApril 12, 2024April 11, 2024\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

In 2023, we assembled a cross-functional team consisting of over 1,000 people to develop solutions to the DSA’s requirements. These [included measures](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/new-features-and-additional-transparency-measures-as-the-digital-services-act-comes-into-effect/) to increase transparency about how our systems work, and to give people more options to tailor their experiences on Facebook and Instagram. Over the course of the last year we have continued to bolster our systems and processes, including, for example, [introducing new measures](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/02/labeling-ai-generated-images-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/) to counter potential risks posed by Generative AI content.\n\nToday, we are publishing [a series of reports](https://transparency.meta.com/reports/regulatory-transparency-reports/) that track our progress, including from an independent audit of Facebook and Instagram, which evaluated the measures we have implemented to comply with the DSA. As part of this process, we created a dedicated team of more than 40 people to support the audit. This team spent more than 20,000 hours, producing documents, completing requests for information, and conducting meetings with the independent auditor. This doesn’t include the thousands of additional hours spent by the wider team building, implementing and running the solutions we have in place to comply with the DSA’s requirements.\n\nThis is a process we have engaged with seriously and thoroughly, and we welcome the opportunity to share the findings.\n\n## **Our progress complying with the DSA**\n\nThe audit found Meta had solutions in place for all 54 sub-articles that received conclusions, with over 90% of those found to be fully compliant. The remaining 10% were concluded as “except for”, meaning the auditor believed that certain adjustments were needed for the solutions to fully meet the requirement under the DSA. Meta did not receive any “adverse” conclusions, meaning nothing met the threshold to be considered fully non-compliant.\n\nThere were a further 14 sub-articles that the auditor was not able to provide a formal conclusion for as those sub-articles are currently under investigation by the European Commission. We remain in conversation with the Commission about this, and believe we have solutions in place that comply with the requirements under the DSA.\n\n## **Making adjustments where necessary**\n\nThere were five “except for” findings across Facebook and Instagram, in three broad categories, where the auditor concluded that implementation did not fully meet the requirement.\n\nTwo of these have been addressed already. One in April 2024, related to Meta’s Ad Library, which was missing context regarding why certain ads were taken down. The other in February 2024, in which users of Facebook Dating were not offered an option to choose not to see recommended content based on their activity on our apps.\n\nFor the three remaining findings, the audit concluded that Meta needed to provide additional information in parts of our DSA Transparency Report, such as breaking down the content moderation measures we take by type of violation. We are working on solutions to address these findings, as set out in our Implementation Reports, which detail our plans to implement the various recommendations set out in the audit. \n\n## **A journey of continuous improvement**\n\nFrom early on, we’ve been supportive of the objectives of the DSA and the creation of a harmonised regulatory regime that effectively protects people’s rights online, while continuing to enable innovation. We have had productive conversations with the European Commission throughout this process and we look forward to continuing to work transparently as the DSA develops.\n\nThe results of the independent audit, in combination with our accompanying Implementation Reports, show that Meta has measures in place for all areas in scope of the audit. In the small number of instances where adjustments were recommended, steps have been taken and changes made. This is testament to our ongoing investment in safety and security, and the work undertaken by thousands of employees at Meta to address requirements under the DSA. We know there will always be more work to do and we will continue to use conclusions from these annual audits to enhance our systems and protect our users.\n\nCategory\n\n: \n\n[Newsroom for Europe, Middle East and Africa](https://about.fb.com/news/category/emea-newsroom/ )\n\n## Related News\n\nMeta \n\n### [Europe Can Make Parenting in a Digital World Easier](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/europe-can-make-parenting-in-a-digital-world-easier/)\n\nParenting in a digital world is hard. \n\nNovember 25, 2024November 25, 2024\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

As a parent myself, I’ve been vocal about the challenge parents like me face every day and like most parents I worry: when is the right moment for my child to have their first phone and will they be safe when navigating the online world for the first time? I’ve dedicated my career to protecting children online, so I am constantly thinking about how we can develop safe, positive experiences for teens on apps like Instagram and ways to make it easier for parents to stay on top of their teens’ online behaviour. \n\nWe know parents want to be involved, but it’s becoming increasingly hard to keep track: Teens now use an average of at least 40 apps a week, with numbers rising, as recent studies show, switching fluidly from app to app, to connect with their friends and family, and discover new interests. With technology evolving every day it can feel impossible for parents to keep up with all the apps their teens use. That’s why as an industry, we need to come together with lawmakers to find easy, effective solutions to better support parents. \n\nTechnology companies are developing numerous protections to ensure that teens’ experiences on their services remain age-appropriate. At Instagram, for example, we recently launched Teen Accounts, a new experience with built-in protections for teens, guided by parents. Teen Accounts, which are starting to roll out in Europe this year, automatically limit who can contact teens, the content they see, and filter offensive comments and DM requests. Teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to change these settings. But different platforms have different content policies, processes, and age verification systems that often don’t meet the same standards. \n\nThis is something which has been top of mind for European policy makers and platforms for over a decade, yet there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to verify age and ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the regulatory framework around it is fragmented. While the European Union (EU) has passed an extensive package of internet regulation in recent years, when it comes to young people online, leadership has been lacking and we’re concerned about what is amounting to a patchwork of divergent approaches and partial protections. At the European level there are several pieces of legislation addressing the protection of minors: the Digital Services Act, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation and several other important initiatives, such as the Better Internet for Kids Strategy, to name just one of many. There are also live policy discussions in several EU Member States, including in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. But none of these initiatives provide a reliable, consistent approach to age verification and age-appropriate experiences, which means young people are having vastly different online experiences depending on which app they use, and where they’re based.\n\nThere is a better way. We need new EU regulation that provides clear, consistent protections for teens online and applies to all apps they use. This regulation should be based on a set of core principles. \n\n## Age Verification & Parental Approval at the OS/App Store Level\n\nWhen a teen wants to download an app, the operating system (OS) or app store should be required to notify their parents so they can decide if they want to approve it, much like when parents are notified if their teen attempts to make a purchase. Placing the point of approval within the OS or app store simplifies the process and leverages optional approval systems already offered by app stores. With this solution, parents can also easily verify the age of their teen, which helps apps to place teens in the right experience for their age. Furthermore, because in some countries parents already provide official identifications like Government IDs to app stores when they purchase a teen’s phone and set up their account, it avoids this sensitive information having to be shared with multiple apps to achieve the same outcome. In Europe, this approach differs depending on where you are, which makes the process even more complex. \n\n## Consistent Content Standards and Parental Supervision Features Across All Apps Teens Use\n\nIt’s time we have common industry standards for what is age-appropriate that parents can rely on: Different platforms have different different rules and different processes. Built-in protections should apply across all apps teens use, in particular social media apps. Similar to our approach with Teen Accounts certain apps should be required to offer parental supervision tools, including the ability for parents to set daily time limits. We also need broader alignment across industry on the types of content companies should consider age appropriate, as there is for other media like movies and video games.\n\n![](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EMEAproposal_Dataset_1b.png?resize=960%2C1061)\n\n## Harmonised Regulation Across the EU\n\nIn Europe, any solution will only be impactful if it is mandated by a legislative framework that applies across all Member States and for all apps teens use. New EU Regulation that holds all apps to the same standard would be the simplest and most effective way to support parents and their [teens](https://www.thinkyoung.eu/ourfeedourfuture). We recently submitted a proposal for a suitable framework to the European Commission as part of their consultation on the Digital Services Act, and a range of other digital platforms shared similar views, demonstrating widespread support across industry. It also comes with growing support amongst parents. [A recent survey](https://pro-assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2024/11/Euro-Parents-Study-on-Teen-App-Downloads_Memo.pdf)* by Morning Consult of European parents found that almost 75% of parents in all eight countries surveyed would support a Europe-wide law requiring parental approval for teens under the age of 16 to download apps. This included 87% of Irish parents, 82% Italian parents, 81% of French parents and 78% German parents. \n\nTechnology will continue to evolve. We need to make sure parents and teens are equipped to safely navigate the online world. I look forward to continuing our work with industry peers and regulators across Europe to find a solution that works and eases the burden on parents. \n\nCategory\n\n: \n\n[Newsroom for Europe, Middle East and Africa](https://about.fb.com/news/category/emea-newsroom/ )\n\n## Related News\n\nMeta \n\n### [Parenting in a Digital World Is Hard.

These features include 17 new sticker packs and an updated DM sticker tray, nicknames for you and your friends and location sharing to make it easier to meet up in person. \n\n## Say It with Stickers\n\nCapture a feeling or find the right reaction with new [stickers](https://help.instagram.com/324367014797360) in DMs. There are 17 new sticker packs with over 300 stickers to share in your DMs when words just aren’t enough. You’ll also be able to favorite stickers from your chats, so you can reuse stickers shared by friends or created with [cutouts](https://help.instagram.com/1382185835750156/?helpref=uf_share).\n\n[![Two phones showing Instagram stickers.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01_Stickers.gif?resize=960%2C836)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01_Stickers.gif)\n\n## Nicknames for You and Your Friends\n\nYou can now customize names across Instagram DMs by adding [nicknames](https://help.instagram.com/598851592468668) for yourself or friends. Share an inside joke with a nickname, or simplify lengthy usernames so your friends are easier to recognize. \n\nTo create a nickname, tap on the chat name at the top of your conversation. Then, tap “Nicknames” and the username of the person in the chat that you want to add a nickname for. Nicknames only appear in your DM chats, and won’t change your username anywhere else on IG. You can change your nickname at any time, and can decide who in a chat is able to change your nickname. \n\n[![Two phones, one showing process of creating nicknames in Instagram, another showing a group chat with nicknames.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02_Nicknames.jpg?resize=960%2C836)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02_Nicknames.jpg)\n\n## Hanging Out Made Easier with Location Sharing\n\nNow, in your DMs, you can [share your live location](https://help.instagram.com/901364391453736) for up to 1 hour or pin a spot on the map to coordinate arrival times, activities or find each other in crowded spaces – perfect for concerts, outings, or other gatherings with friends. Spend more time together, and less time coordinating.\n\nLive location can only be shared privately in DMs, either in a 1:1 or group chat, will expire after 1 hour, and is off by default. When sharing, only those in the specific chat can see your location and your location can’t be forwarded to other chats. You’ll also see an indicator at the top of your chat to ensure you don’t forget that you’re sharing your live location. You can stop sharing your location any time.. Remember to always be mindful of your privacy and only share your location with people you know in real life.[ ](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_location-sharing.jpg)\n\nLocation sharing features are currently only available in select countries.\n\n[![Two phones showing how to share your location in DMs, including a map and the actual pinned location in a group chat.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_location-sharing.jpg?resize=960%2C836)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_location-sharing.jpg)\n\nHead to the [Instagram blog](https://about.instagram.com/blog) to learn more about the different ways you can connect through the app. \n\nCategories\n\n: \n\n[Instagram](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/instagram/ ) [Product News](https://about.fb.com/news/category/product-news/ )\n\nTags: \n\n[Instagram](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/instagram/)\n\n## Related News\n\nInstagram \n\n### [Edit Your Messages, Pin Your Chats and More Instagram DM Updates](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/03/instagram-dm-updates/)\n\nWe’re adding new DM features to help you better connect with friends, express yourself, and organize your inbox. \n\nMarch 4, 2024April 3, 2024\n\n## Related Pages\n\n  * [Instagram](https://about.fb.com/technologies/instagram/)\n\n\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

Today, for the first time, we are sharing our approach to countering the cross-border criminal organizations behind forced-labor scam compounds under our [Dangerous Organizations and Individuals (DOI)](https://transparency.meta.com/features/dangerous-orgs-and-individuals) and safety policies. We hope that sharing our insights will help inform our industry’s defenses so we can collectively help protect people from criminal scammers.\n\n## What Is ‘Pig Butchering’?\n\nOne of the most egregious and sophisticated fraud scams, ‘pig butchering’ is all about building trusted personal relationships online with someone only to manipulate them to deposit more and more money into an investment scheme, often using cryptocurrency, and ultimately lose that money. \n\n## Who’s Behind ‘Pig Butchering’?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, scam compounds run by organized crime [emerged](https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/TOC_Convergence_Report_2024.pdf) in the Asia Pacific region as one of the major sources of ‘pig butchering’ and other scam activity. And while they are mostly based in Asia, scam centers target people across the globe. These criminal scam hubs lure often unsuspecting job seekers with too-good-to-be-true job postings on local job boards, forums and recruitment platforms to then force them to work as online scammers, often under the threat of physical abuse.\n\nThe scale and sophistication of this threat is unprecedented, with the US Institute of Peace estimating that up to [300,000 people](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/ssg_transnational-crime-southeast-asia.pdf) are forced into scamming others around the world by these criminal groups, with about [$64 billion dollars](https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/05/transnational-crime-southeast-asia-growing-threat-global-peace-and-security) stolen worldwide annually as of the end of 2023. \n\nFor over two years, our teams have been focused on investigating and disrupting the activities of the criminal scam centers in Southeast Asia. While our initial focus was on scam centers in Cambodia, we have since worked to keep pace with the expansion of these groups as they began to appear in places like Laos, Myanmar and more recently the United Arab Emirates. At the outset, we actively engaged with expert NGOs and law enforcement partners in the US and Southeast Asia to better understand the modus operandi of these criminal groups, including in places like Sihanoukville in Cambodia, which is [reported](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/ssg_transnational-crime-southeast-asia.pdf) to be a hotbed for Chinese organized crime-linked scams. \n\n## How These Scams Work\n\nThe criminal compounds force their workers to engage in a wide range of malicious activity, from cryptocurrency, gambling, loan and investment scams (e.g., ‘pig butchering’) to government and other impersonation scams. Across many internet and telecom services, they make up deceptive personas, often masquerading as attractive single people or pretending to represent government agencies or trusted public figures and businesses. \n\nWe assess that much of the scam centers’ activity is tightly scripted by criminal syndicates to scale their operations. It includes some forced-labor scammers focusing on casting a wide net online (often through automated means) to ‘spray and pray’ by reaching out to a large number of people via text message or online with a relatively generic appeal in hopes that some of them will respond. If they do, another group of scammers focus on more tailored social engineering attempts to build trust and convince the potential targets to send money and invest. \n\nThese scams can start on dating apps, text message, email, social media or messaging apps, then ultimately move to scammer-controlled accounts on crypto apps or scam websites masquerading as investment platforms. \n\nTypical of ‘pig butchering’ schemes, the target may be allowed to withdraw small amounts to build trust, but once they start asking for their ‘investment’ back or it becomes clear that they do not have more funds to send to the scammer, overseas scammers typically disappear with all the money.\n\n[![GIF explaining the steps of a Pig Butchering scam](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01_Pig-Butchering_Animation.gif?resize=960%2C836)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01_Pig-Butchering_Animation.gif)\n\n## Our Approach to Countering Scam Compounds\n\nIn the past two years, we have stood up teams and systems to help identify and go after these scam hotspots globally under our DOI and safety policies. In addition, we’ve set up critical partnerships across our company and with key external partners to ensure that we are taking a holistic approach to defending people against the wide range of scams these groups are attempting online and offline. Here are some details:\n\n**Dangerous Organizations and Individuals Policy**\n\nTo counter these scam compounds globally, we rely on our [DOI policies](https://transparency.meta.com/features/dangerous-orgs-and-individuals) as the most effective and appropriate set of measures for disrupting organized crime. Using both our internal subject matter expertise and insights from external stakeholders, we are continuously investigating and assessing criminal organizations involved in this activity for designation. Once designated as DOIs, the entities are banned from our platform and subject to a wide range of enforcement tools. \n\n**On-Platform Enforcements**\n\nOur investigative teams monitor these designated DOIs for attempts to circumvent our enforcement. This includes looking for new scam compounds globally and continuously disrupting their operations. This year alone, we’ve taken down over two million accounts associated with scam centers in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. We also continue to update behavioral and technical signals associated with these hubs to help us scale automated detection and block malicious infrastructure and recidivist attempts.\n\n**Working with Others to Counter and Deter This Threat**\n\nWe know that these are extremely persistent and well-resourced criminal organizations working to evolve their tactics and evade detection, including by law enforcement. We’ve seen them operate across borders with little deterrence and across many internet platforms in an attempt to ensure that any one company or country has only a narrow view into the full picture of scam operations. This makes collaboration within industries and countries even more critical.\n\n**Law Enforcement**\n\nAs part of our threat disruption efforts, we are working with law enforcement agencies around the globe to share our insights into how this criminal industry operates and help law enforcement protect communities from these scams. \n\n> _“The Royal Thai Police has been working with Meta on disrupting criminal scam centers for over two years. We’ve been able to share information so they can investigate and take action against the bad guys and help us hold the criminal syndicates behind these scam centers accountable.”_\n> \n> _— Police Major General Teeradej Thumsutee, Commander of the Investigation Division of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, Royal Thai Police_\n\n**Industry Peers**\n\nWhen possible, we’re working to share threat information with our industry peers who are focused on preventing criminal syndicates from targeting people on our respective platforms. As an example, recently, our team disrupted malicious activity that appeared to originate from a newly stood up scam compound in Cambodia attempting to target people in Japanese and Chinese languages. We began investigating this activity based on information shared with us by our peers at OpenAI, who detected and disrupted the actors’ efforts to use their tools to generate and translate the scammers’ content. We also shared threat information about the scam centers we have disrupted to enable further investigations across the internet.\n\nIn addition, last week, as part of the[ Tech Against Scams Coalition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tech-companies-announce-a-new-coalition-to-fight-online-fraud--pig-butchering-scams-302149506.html), we co-convened a Summit on Countering Online Criminal Scam Syndicates. It included international law enforcement, government officials, NGOs and tech companies that came together to discuss ways to make further progress in tackling this transnational threat. The Coalition includes companies across dating apps, social media apps, financial institutions and crypto platforms, like Coinbase, Ripple, Meta and Match Group, the parent company of Tinder and Hinge.\n\n**Building Product Defenses and Raising Awareness About Scams**\n\nIn addition to disrupting scam centers, teams across Meta are constantly rolling out new product features to help protect people on our apps from known scam tactics at scale. For example, we will show you a warning in [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/privacy?locale=en_GB#:~:text=In%2Dapp%20safety%20notices%20pop,if%20something%20isn%27t%20right) and [Instagram DMs](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/staying-safe-and-secure-on-instagram) reminding you to be aware of potentially suspicious interactions or cold outreach from people you don’t know, so you can slow down and review before accepting a message request. On WhatsApp, if you’re added to a group chat by someone you don’t know, you’ll now see a context card giving you more information about the group. It’ll show who added you, how recently the group was created and who created it so you have context on this outreach.\n\nAs part of our [continuous updates](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/testing-combat-scams-restore-compromised-accounts/) on Meta’s work to [protect people from scammers](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/whatsapp-teams-up-with-national-trading-standards/), we’ll continue sharing regular updates about our work to counter scams more broadly, including safety tips and product updates rolled out across our apps, with more to follow in the coming weeks.\n\n[![Infographic listing tips for spotting scams online](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02_Infograph.jpg?resize=960%2C1707)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02_Infograph.jpg)\n\nCategories\n\n: \n\n[Integrity and Security](https://about.fb.com/news/category/integrity-security/ ) [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/meta/ ) [Public Policy](https://about.fb.com/news/category/public-policy/ ) [Safety and Expression](https://about.fb.com/news/category/safety-and-expression/ )\n\nTags: \n\n[Safety](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/safety/) [Security News](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/security/) [Well-Being](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/well-being/)\n\n## Related News\n\nMeta \n\n### [Testing New Ways to Combat Scams and Help Restore Access to Compromised Accounts](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/testing-combat-scams-restore-compromised-accounts/)\n\nWe’re building on our existing defenses by testing new ways to protect people and make it harder for scammers to deceive others. \n\nOctober 21, 2024October 21, 2024\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.
