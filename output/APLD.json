The aggregate principal amount of notes sold in the offering was $450 million, which includes $75 million aggregate principal amount of notes issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional notes granted to the initial purchasers, which the Initial Purchasers exercised in full on October 31, 2024.\n\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with a cap price of $14.72 (representing a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price) and, pursuant to share repurchases and prepaid forward repurchase transaction, repurchased approximately $84 million of the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe table below illustrates the potential net dilution expectations from the overall transaction.\n\n![Applied Digital](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/4892d38d-29e4-4243-89d3-18e692313154/applied-digital-corporation.png)\n\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately $434.5 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company expects to use approximately $84 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund share repurchases of the Company’s common stock (the “common stock”) in connection with the offering including (i) $52.7 million to fund the cost of entering into prepaid forward repurchase and (ii) $31.3 million to repurchase shares of the common stock, approximately $51.8 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions, and the remainder for general corporate purposes.\n\n**About Applied Digital**\n\nApplied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) develops, builds and operates next-generation data centers and cloud infrastructure.

The Convertible Notes will be sold in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\n\n**Key Elements of the Transaction:**\n\n  * $375 million 2.75% Convertible Notes offering (32.5% conversion premium) \n  * Capped call transactions entered into in connection with the pricing of Convertible Notes due 2030 with an initial cap price of $14.72 per share of common stock, which represents a 100% premium to the closing sale price of Applied Digital’s common stock on October 30, 2024 \n  * Share Repurchase Programs of approximately $84 million of shares of the common stock in connection with the offering, consisting of a prepaid forward repurchase (as described below) and concurrent share buyback\n\n\n\nApplied Digital has granted the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including the date on which the Convertible Notes are first issued, up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The offering is expected to close on November 4, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\n**Use of Proceeds:**\n\nThe Company estimates that the aggregate net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $361.8 million (or approximately $434.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use approximately $84 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund share repurchases of the Company’s common stock (the “common stock”) in connection with the offering including (i) $52.7 million to fund the cost of entering into prepaid forward repurchase (as described below) and (ii) $31.3 million to repurchase shares of the common stock, approximately $43.1 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions (as described below, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then the Company intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions.\n\n**Additional Details of the Convertible Notes:**\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest at a rate of 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2025. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. Prior to March 1, 2030, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the common stock, at the Company’s election, subject to certain restrictions. The conversion rate will initially be 102.5431 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.75 per share of the common stock). The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes represents a premium of approximately 32.5% to the $7.36 closing price per share of the common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 30, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. In addition, upon conversion in connection with certain corporate events or a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate.\n\nThe Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to December 1, 2027. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes (subject to certain limitations), at its option, on or after December 1, 2027, if the last reported sale price of the common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption to holders at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a cash repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the applicable repurchase date.\n\n****Share Repurchase Program of Prepaid Forward Repurchase and Concurrent Share Repurchases** :**\n\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into share repurchase programs consisting of a prepaid forward repurchase and a concurrent share buyback. Pursuant to the share repurchase programs, the Company will repurchase an aggregate of approximately $84 million of shares of the common stock through (i) privately negotiated transactions effected concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Notes with respect to $31.3 million of shares of the common stock (with the purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased in such transactions equal to $7.36 closing price per share of the common stock on October 30, 2024) and (ii) a privately negotiated prepaid forward stock repurchase transaction (the “prepaid forward repurchase”) with one of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes (the “forward counterparty”) with respect to $52.7 million of shares of the common stock.\n\nThe initial aggregate number of shares of the common stock underlying the prepaid forward repurchase is approximately 7.2 million shares. In the event that the Company pays any cash dividends on its common stock, the forward counterparty will pay an equivalent amount to the Company. The prepaid forward repurchase is generally intended to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the forward counterparty or its affiliates and investors in the Convertible Notes, relating to shares of the common stock by which investors in the Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of the common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the Convertible Notes. As a result, the prepaid forward repurchase is expected to allow the investors to establish short positions that generally correspond to (but may be greater than) commercially reasonable initial hedges of their investment in the Convertible Notes. In the event of such greater initial hedges, investors may offset such greater portion by purchasing shares of the common stock on the day the Company prices the Convertible Notes. Facilitating investors’ hedge positions by entering into the prepaid forward repurchase, particularly if investors purchase shares of common stock on the pricing date, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of shares of the common stock and effectively raise the conversion price of the Convertible Notes. In connection with establishing its initial hedges of the prepaid forward repurchase, the forward counterparty or its affiliates generally expect to, but are not required to, enter into one or more derivative transactions with respect to shares of the common stock with the investors of the Convertible Notes concurrently with or after the pricing of the Convertible Notes.\n\nThe Company’s entry into the prepaid forward repurchase with the forward counterparty and the entry by the forward counterparty into derivative transactions in respect of the common stock with the investors of the Convertible Notes could have the effect of increasing (or reducing the size of any decrease in) the market price of the common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Convertible Notes and effectively raising the conversion price of the Convertible Notes.\n\nNeither the Company nor the forward counterparty will control how investors of the Convertible Notes may use such derivative transactions. In addition, such investors may enter into other transactions relating to the common stock or the Convertible Notes in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of the common stock. As a result, the existence of the prepaid forward repurchase, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of the common stock over the terms of the prepaid forward repurchase than there otherwise would have been had the Company not entered into the prepaid forward repurchase. Such purchases or sales could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of the common stock and/or the price of the Convertible Notes.\n\nIn addition, the forward counterparty or its affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding one or more derivative transactions with respect to shares of the common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the common stock or other securities of the Company’s in secondary market transactions at any time following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes. These activities could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect the ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\n\n**Capped Call Transactions:**\n\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially $14.72 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the common stock of $7.36 per share on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 30, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Convertible Notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.\n\nThe capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the common stock upon conversion of any Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to purchase shares of the common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call transactions or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of the common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect holders of the Convertible Notes’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion of the Convertible Notes or during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of such Convertible Notes.\n\nThe Convertible Notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the Convertibles Notes and such shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. The Convertible Notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes, nor shall there be any sale of the Convertible Notes or common stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\n\n**About Applied Digital**\n\nApplied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) develops, builds and operates next-generation data centers and cloud infrastructure.

The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms the offering may be completed.\n\nThe Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions (as described below). The Company expects to repurchase shares of common stock (the “common stock”) in an amount up to one third of the final aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, through (i) privately negotiated transactions effected concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Notes (where the Company expects the purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased in such transactions to be equal to the closing price per share of the common stock on the date the offering of the Convertible Notes is priced) and (ii) the prepaid forward described below.

Prior to March 1, 2030, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the common stock, at the Company’s election, subject to certain restrictions. The initial conversion rate, interest rate, and other terms of the Convertible Notes will be determined at the time of pricing in negotiations with the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes.\n\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into a prepaid forward stock purchase transaction (the “prepaid forward”) with one of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes or their affiliates (the “forward counterparty”). The prepaid forward is generally intended to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the forward counterparty or its affiliates and investors in the Convertible Notes relating to shares of the common stock by which investors in the Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of the common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the Convertible Notes.

In addition, such investors may enter into other transactions relating to the common stock or the Convertible Notes in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of the common stock. As a result, the existence of the prepaid forward, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of the common stock over the terms of the prepaid forward than there otherwise would have been had the Company not entered into the prepaid forward. Such purchases or sales could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of the common stock and/or the price of the Convertible Notes.\n\nIn addition, the forward counterparty or its affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding one or more derivative transactions with respect to shares of the common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the common stock or other securities of the Company’s in secondary market transactions at any time following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes. These activities could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect the ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\n\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). If the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Convertible Notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.\n\nThe capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the common stock upon conversion of any Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to purchase shares of the common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call transactions or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of the common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect holders of the Convertible Notes’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion of the Convertible Notes or during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of such Convertible Notes.\n\nThe Convertible Notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the Convertibles Notes and such shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. The Convertible Notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes, nor shall there be any sale of the Convertible Notes or common stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction**.**\n\n**About Applied Digital**\n\nApplied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) develops, builds and operates next-generation data centers and cloud infrastructure.

The Company also provided an operational update.\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues of $60.7 million, up 67% from the prior year period\n  * Net loss of $4.2 million\n  * Net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.03\n  * Adjusted net loss of $21.6 million, which was negatively impacted by $4.4 million of expenses associated with facilities and equipment that were not yet generating revenue\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $20.0 million\n  * Adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.15\n\n\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Loss, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these Non-GAAP Measures to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) is set forth below. See “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.”_\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  1. The Company announced on September 5, 2024 that it has entered into definitive agreements for a $160 million private placement financing priced at market, from a group of institutional and accredited investors, NVIDIA and Related Companies, the most prominent privately-owned real estate company and leader in complex infrastructure and data center development. This strategic financing underscores Applied Digital's position as a trusted pioneer in the accelerated compute space. The transaction closed on September 9, 2024.\n  2. The Company added two additional clusters to our Cloud Services Business, increasing the total to six clusters, each containing 1,024 GPUs.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n**Wes Cummins, Chairman and CEO of Applied Digital commented:** “After the close of the quarter, our balance sheet significantly improved due to strategic investments from a group of institutional and accredited investors, NVIDIA, and Related Companies. We sincerely appreciate the vote of confidence from our investors and look forward to deploying this capital into high-return projects in the digital infrastructure sector.\n\nWe have made significant strides in our key growth initiatives. We are finalizing a lease agreement with a U.S.-based hyperscaler for our 100 MW facility currently under construction. This state-of-the-art, 369,000+ square-foot facility is specifically designed for HPC applications, including artificial intelligence. Furthermore, we are in the design phase for two additional buildings at this location, which will increase the total capacity to 400 MW.\n\nOur vision is to become a platform capable of building and operating multiple HPC data centers. This starts with our Ellendale campus and continues with three additional campuses we are actively marketing totaling 1.4 GW. To support this vision, we have added several industry veterans to our team and are already working on the design of our next two buildings, which will provide an additional 300 MW of capacity at our Ellendale HPC Campus. We are incredibly proud of the progress made this quarter and look forward to providing further updates as the year progresses.\n\nLastly, we are delighted to announce some executive changes to better position the Company for managing its rapidly expanding growth. David Rench will assume the role of Chief Administrative Officer and Saidal Mohmand will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer, with these changes to be effective Monday, October 14th.”\n\n**Cloud Services Update**\n\nApplied Digital’s Cloud Services Business provides high-performance computing power for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we brought two clusters online contributing to the Company recognizing $25.9 million in revenues from the Cloud Services Business segment.\n\n**HPC Data Center Hosting Update**\n\nApplied Digital’s HPC Data Center Hosting Business designs, builds, and operates next-generation data centers, which are designed to provide massive computing power and support high-performance computing applications within a cost-effective model. During the prior fiscal year, the Company broke ground on its first 100 MW HPC facility in Ellendale, North Dakota. The new 369,000+ square-foot building will provide ultra-low-cost and highly efficient liquid-cooled infrastructure for HPC applications.\n\nWe are finalizing a lease agreement with a U.S.-based hyperscaler for our 100 MW facility currently under construction. Beyond this, we plan to bring an additional 300 MW online through two additional buildings, which are in the design stage, ultimately increasing Ellendale's total HPC capacity to 400 MW. We are also in advanced negotiations with traditional financing institutions to secure funding for these projects.\n\n**Data Center Hosting Update**\n\nOur Data Center Hosting Business operates data centers to provide energized space to crypto mining customers. As of August 31, 2024, our 106 MW facility in Jamestown, North Dakota and our 180 MW facility in Ellendale, North Dakota are operating at full capacity.\n\nThe sale of our Garden City, Texas hosting facility to Marathon was finalized in April 2024. On July 30, 2024 the conditional approval requirements related to the release of the escrowed funds from the sale were met, resulting in the release of the escrow funds to the Company totaling $25 million, which are included in gain on classification of held for sale on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**Financial Results for Fiscal First Quarter 2025**\n\n_Operating Results_\n\nTotal revenues in the fiscal first quarter 2025 were $60.7 million, up 67% from the fiscal first quarter 2024. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the Company recognizing revenue from its Cloud Services business segment due to the launch of the service at the end of the previous fiscal year.\n\nCost of revenues in the fiscal first quarter 2025 was $61.1 million compared to $25.2 million in the fiscal first quarter 2024. The increase was primarily driven by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and lease and related expenses, primarily driven by the growth in the business, as more facilities were energized compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2024. The increase in the cost of revenues was also attributable to higher personnel costs.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the fiscal first quarter 2025 were $14.3 million compared to $16.2 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\n\nNet loss for the fiscal first quarter 2025 was $4.3 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of 149.0 million shares. This compares to a net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, based on a weighted average share count of 100.5 million shares for the fiscal first quarter 2024.\n\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, for the fiscal first quarter of 2025, was $21.6 million or adjusted net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.15, based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 149.0 million shares. This compares to an adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $0.1 million, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 100.5 million shares. Adjusted net loss was negatively impacted by $4.4 million of expenses associated with facilities and equipment that were not yet generating revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fiscal first quarter 2025 was $20.0 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $9.9 million for the fiscal first quarter 2024. Despite the overall growth in this measure, Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $4.1 million of expenses associated with facilities that were not yet generating revenue.\n\n_Balance Sheet_\n\nWe ended the fiscal first quarter 2025 with $86.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, compared to $31.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2024, along with $143.6 million in debt, compared to $125.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2024.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nApplied Digital will host a conference call today, October 9, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results.

Follow us on X (formerly Twitter) at @APLDdigital.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding, among other things, future operating and financial performance, product development, market position, business strategy and objectives. These statements use words, and variations of words, such as \"continue,\" \"build,\" \"future,\" \"increase,\" \"drive,\" \"believe,\" \"look,\" \"ahead,\" \"confident,\" \"deliver,\" \"outlook,\" \"expect,\" and \"predict.\" Other examples of forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, (i) statements of Company plans and objectives, including our evolving business model, or estimates or predictions of actions by suppliers, (ii) statements of future economic performance, and (iii) statements of assumptions underlying other statements and statements about the Company or its business. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events and thus are inherently subject to uncertainty. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company's expectations and projections. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include: decline in demand for our products and services; the volatility of the crypto asset industry; the inability to comply with developments and changes in regulation; cash flow and access to capital; and maintenance of third party relationships. Information in this release is as of the dates and time periods indicated herein, and the Company does not undertake to update any of the information contained in these materials, except as required by law.\n\n**Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented under GAAP, we are presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. We are providing these non-GAAP financial measures to disclose additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations by providing perspective on results absent one-time or significant non-cash items. We utilize these measures in the business planning process to understand expected operating performance and to evaluate results against those expectations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results regarding factors and trends affecting our business and provide a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental measures to the Company’s performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore, are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, we caution investors that the non-GAAP financial measures as used by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, investors should be aware that when evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, these measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be items that we may exclude for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of the adjustments to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the non-GAAP reconciliations provided below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\n\n**_Change in Presentation_**\n\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company updated its presentation of non-GAAP measures. As a result of this updated presentation, the Company no longer excludes start-up costs as an adjustment to Operating loss, Net loss, or EBITDA in our calculation of Adjusted operating loss, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation, and Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation per diluted share are non-GAAP measures and are defined below.\n\n**_Adjusted Operating Loss, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share_**\n\n“Adjusted Operating Loss” and “Adjusted Net Loss” are non-GAAP financial measures that represent operating loss and net loss, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation, non-recurring repair expenses, diligence, acquisition, disposition and integration expenses, litigation expenses, non-recurring research and development expenses, gain on classification of held for sale, accelerated depreciation and amortization, loss on legal settlement, as well as other non-recurring expenses that Management believes are not representative of the Company’s expected ongoing costs. Adjusted Net Loss is Adjusted Operating Loss further adjusted for the losses associated with the abandonment of assets, changes in fair value of debt and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define “Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share” as Adjusted Net Loss divided by weighted average diluted share count.\n\n**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\n“EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, non-recurring repair expenses, diligence, acquisition, disposition and integration expenses, litigation expenses, non-recurring research and development expenses, (gain)/loss on classification of held for sale, the losses associated with the abandonment of assets, changes in fair value of debt, debt extinguishment, as well as the loss on legal settlement and other non-recurring expenses that Management believes are not representative of the Company’s expected ongoing costs.\n\n**Investor Relations Contacts** Matt Glover or Ralf EsperGateway Group, Inc.

          "content": "October 9, 2024\nApplied Digital Reports Fiscal First Quarter\n2025 Results\nDALLAS, Oct. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital Corporation (Nasdaq:\nAPLD) (\"Applied Digital\" or the \"Company\"), a designer, builder, and operator of next-\ngeneration digital infrastructure designed for high-performance computing (“HPC”)\napplications, cloud services (“Cloud Services”), and data center hosting (“Data Center\nHosting”), reported financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31, 2024. The\nCompany also provided an operational update.\nFiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights\nRevenues of $60.7 million, up 67% from the prior year period\nNet loss of $4.2 million\nNet loss per basic and diluted share of $0.03\nAdjusted net loss of $21.6 million, which was negatively impacted by $4.4 million of\nexpenses associated with facilities and equipment that were not yet generating\nrevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA of $20.0 million\nAdjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.15\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Loss, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted Net Loss per\nDiluted Share are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these Non-GAAP\nMeasures to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) is set forth below.\nSee “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.”\nRecent Operational Highlights\n1. The Company announced on September 5, 2024 that it has entered into definitive\nagreements for a $160 million private placement financing priced at market, from a\ngroup of institutional and accredited investors, NVIDIA and Related Companies, the\nmost prominent privately-owned real estate company and leader in complex\ninfrastructure and data center development. This strategic financing underscores\nApplied Digital's position as a trusted pioneer in the accelerated compute space. The\ntransaction closed on September 9, 2024.\n2. The Company added two additional clusters to our Cloud Services Business,\nincreasing the total to six clusters, each containing 1,024 GPUs.\nManagement Commentary\nWes Cummins, Chairman and CEO of Applied Digital commented: “After the close of\nthe quarter, our balance sheet significantly improved due to strategic investments from a\ngroup of institutional and accredited investors, NVIDIA, and Related Companies. We\nsincerely appreciate the vote of confidence from our investors and look forward to deploying\nthis capital into high-return projects in the digital infrastructure sector.\nWe have made significant strides in our key growth initiatives. We are finalizing a lease\nagreement with a U.S.-based hyperscaler for our 100 MW facility currently under\nconstruction. This state-of-the-art, 369,000+ square-foot facility is specifically designed for\nHPC applications, including artificial intelligence. Furthermore, we are in the design phase\nfor two additional buildings at this location, which will increase the total capacity to 400 MW.\nOur vision is to become a platform capable of building and operating multiple HPC data\ncenters. This starts with our Ellendale campus and continues with three additional campuses\nwe are actively marketing totaling 1.4 GW. To support this vision, we have added several\nindustry veterans to our team and are already working on the design of our next two\nbuildings, which will provide an additional 300 MW of capacity at our Ellendale HPC\nCampus. We are incredibly proud of the progress made this quarter and look forward to\nproviding further updates as the year progresses.\nLastly, we are delighted to announce some executive changes to better position the\nCompany for managing its rapidly expanding growth. David Rench will assume the role of\nChief Administrative Officer and Saidal Mohmand will assume the role of Chief Financial\nOfficer, with these changes to be effective Monday, October 14th.”\nCloud Services Update\nApplied Digital’s Cloud Services Business provides high-performance computing power for\nartificial intelligence and machine learning applications. During the three months ended\nAugust 31, 2024, we brought two clusters online contributing to the Company recognizing\n$25.9 million in revenues from the Cloud Services Business segment.\nHPC Data Center Hosting Update\nApplied Digital’s HPC Data Center Hosting Business designs, builds, and operates next-\ngeneration data centers, which are designed to provide massive computing power and\nsupport high-performance computing applications within a cost-effective model. During the\nprior fiscal year, the Company broke ground on its first 100 MW HPC facility in Ellendale,\nNorth Dakota. The new 369,000+ square-foot building will provide ultra-low-cost and highly\nefficient liquid-cooled infrastructure for HPC applications.\nWe are finalizing a lease agreement with a U.S.-based hyperscaler for our 100 MW facility\ncurrently under construction. Beyond this, we plan to bring an additional 300 MW online\nthrough two additional buildings, which are in the design stage, ultimately increasing\nEllendale's total HPC capacity to 400 MW. We are also in advanced negotiations with\ntraditional financing institutions to secure funding for these projects.\nData Center Hosting Update\nOur Data Center Hosting Business operates data centers to provide energized space to\ncrypto mining customers. As of August 31, 2024, our 106 MW facility in Jamestown, North\nDakota and our 180 MW facility in Ellendale, North Dakota are operating at full capacity.\nThe sale of our Garden City, Texas hosting facility to Marathon was finalized in April 2024.\nOn July 30, 2024 the conditional approval requirements related to the release of the\nescrowed funds from the sale were met, resulting in the release of the escrow funds to the\nCompany totaling $25 million, which are included in gain on classification of held for sale on\nour unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nFinancial Results for Fiscal First Quarter 2025\nOperating Results\nTotal revenues in the fiscal first quarter 2025 were $60.7 million, up 67% from the fiscal first\nquarter 2024. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the Company recognizing\nrevenue from its Cloud Services business segment due to the launch of the service at the\nend of the previous fiscal year.\nCost of revenues in the fiscal first quarter 2025 was $61.1 million compared to $25.2 million\nin the fiscal first quarter 2024. The increase was primarily driven by increases in depreciation\nand amortization expense and lease and related expenses, primarily driven by the growth in\nthe business, as more facilities were energized compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\nThe increase in the cost of revenues was also attributable to higher personnel costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the fiscal first quarter 2025 were $14.3\nmillion compared to $16.2 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\nNet loss for the fiscal first quarter 2025 was $4.3 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted\nshare, based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of 149.0 million shares.\nThis compares to a net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, based on\na weighted average share count of 100.5 million shares for the fiscal first quarter 2024.\nAdjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, for the fiscal first quarter of 2025, was $21.6 million\nor adjusted net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.15, based on a weighted average\nshare count during the quarter of approximately 149.0 million shares. This compares to an\nadjusted net loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $0.1 million, or $0.00 per basic and\ndiluted share, for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 based on a weighted average share count\nduring the quarter of approximately 100.5 million shares. Adjusted net loss was negatively\nimpacted by $4.4 million of expenses associated with facilities and equipment that were not\nyet generating revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fiscal first quarter 2025 was $20.0\nmillion compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $9.9 million for the fiscal first quarter 2024.\nDespite the overall growth in this measure, Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by\n$4.1 million of expenses associated with facilities that were not yet generating revenue.\nBalance Sheet\nWe ended the fiscal first quarter 2025 with $86.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and\nrestricted cash, compared to $31.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2024, along with $143.6\nmillion in debt, compared to $125.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2024.\nConference Call\nApplied Digital will host a conference call today, October 9, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time\n(2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results.

We\nbelieve that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP\nfinancial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our\nbusiness operating results regarding factors and trends affecting our business and provide a\nreasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental measures to the\nCompany’s performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore, are\nnot intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures.\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by\nGAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nBecause of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, we caution\ninvestors that the non-GAAP financial measures as used by us in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from,\nand therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other\ncompanies. Further, investors should be aware that when evaluating these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, these measures should not be construed as an inference that the\nCompany’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition,\nfrom time to time in the future there may be items that we may exclude for purposes of our\nnon-GAAP financial measures and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we\nhave historically excluded for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we\nmay determine to modify the nature of the adjustments to arrive at our non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Investors should review the non-GAAP reconciliations provided below and not\nrely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nChange in Presentation\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company updated its presentation of non-GAAP\nmeasures. As a result of this updated presentation, the Company no longer excludes start-\nup costs as an adjustment to Operating loss, Net loss, or EBITDA in our calculation of\nAdjusted operating loss, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation,\nAdjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation per diluted share, and Adjusted\nEBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital\nCorporation, and Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation per diluted\nshare are non-GAAP measures and are defined below.\nAdjusted Operating Loss, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted\nShare\n“Adjusted Operating Loss” and “Adjusted Net Loss” are non-GAAP financial measures that\nrepresent operating loss and net loss, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation,\nnon-recurring repair expenses, diligence, acquisition, disposition and integration expenses,\nlitigation expenses, non-recurring research and development expenses, gain on\nclassification of held for sale, accelerated depreciation and amortization, loss on legal\nsettlement, as well as other non-recurring expenses that Management believes are not\nrepresentative of the Company’s expected ongoing costs. Adjusted Net Loss is Adjusted\nOperating Loss further adjusted for the losses associated with the abandonment of assets,\nchanges in fair value of debt and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define “Adjusted Net\nLoss per Diluted Share” as Adjusted Net Loss divided by weighted average diluted share\ncount.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n“EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, non-\nrecurring repair expenses, diligence, acquisition, disposition and integration expenses,\nlitigation expenses, non-recurring research and development expenses, (gain)/loss on\nclassification of held for sale, the losses associated with the abandonment of assets,\nchanges in fair value of debt, debt extinguishment, as well as the loss on legal settlement\nand other non-recurring expenses that Management believes are not representative of the\nCompany’s expected ongoing costs.\nInvestor Relations Contacts\nMatt Glover or Ralf Esper\nGateway Group, Inc.\n(949) 574-3860\nAPLD@gateway-grp.com\nMedia Contact\nBuffy Harakidas, EVP\nJSA (Jaymie Scotto &
