(Nasdaq: CECO) (\"CECO\"), (the “Company”)** , a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company whose solutions protect people, the environment, and industrial equipment, today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. In addition, CECO, announces it has completed the acquisition of WK, an Industrial Air company headquartered in Germany, in early October. Additionally, the Company announced the acquisition of Profire Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: PFIE) (“Profire”), a leader in burner management technology and combustion control systems that provide mission-critical combustion automation and control solutions and services to improve environmental efficiency, safety and reliability for industrial thermal applications globally.\n\n**_Third Quarter Summary_****(1)**\n\n  * Orders of $162.3 million, up 12 percent\n  * Backlog of $437.5 million\n  * Revenue of $135.5 million, down 9 percent\n  * Gross profit of $45.3 million, up 5 percent; Gross margin of 33.4 percent, up 460 basis points\n  * Net income of $2.1 million, down 36 percent; non-GAAP net income of $5.2 million, down 32 percent\n  * GAAP EPS (diluted) of $0.06; non-GAAP EPS (diluted) of $0.14, down 36 percent\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $14.3 million, down 5 percent\n  * Free cash flow of $11.1 million, down $17.4 million\n\n\n\n**_Subsequent to the Quarter_**\n\n  * Completes the acquisition of WK in early October\n  * Announces the acquisition of Profire _; expected to close by January 2025_\n\n\n\n(1) All comparisons are versus the comparable prior year period, unless otherwise stated.Reconciliations of GAAP (reported) to non-GAAP measures are in the attached financial tables.\n\nTodd Gleason, CECO’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “While our third quarter produced very strong orders and a new record backlog, we were disappointed that we fell short of the anticipated quarterly revenue and income outlook as a handful of customer-driven delays in larger projects could not be overcome by continued progress with margin expansion and other actions. These delayed projects are expected to begin activity over the coming months and the impact is reflected in our updated full year 2024 and newly introduced full year 2025 outlook. We are excited to have been awarded several large energy transition and general industrial orders in the quarter and we anticipate this trend to continue as we are forecasting a very strong fourth quarter bookings period.”\n\nThird quarter operating income was $7.2 million, down $0.7 million or 9 percent when compared to $7.9 million in the third quarter 2023. On an adjusted basis, non-GAAP operating income was $11.0 million, down $1.8 million or 14 percent when compared to $12.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net income was $2.1 million in the quarter, down $1.2 million or 36 percent when compared to $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $5.2 million, down $2.4 million or 32 percent when compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $14.3 million, reflecting a margin of 10.6 percent, was down 5 percent compared to $15.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Free cash flow in the quarter was $11.1 million, down $17.4 million compared to $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Completes Acquisition of WK_**\n\nCECO today announced that in early October it completed the acquisition of Germany-based, WK – a leading industrial air business with well-established global customers and a strong Asia-Pacific presence, based out of Singapore. WK designs, engineers and supplies a broad range of cutting-edge technical equipment and systems for process and environmental and surface technology applications, as well as innovative sustainable solutions. This acquisition strengthens CECO’s footprint and capabilities within the industrial processing solutions segment and further advances the Company’s Industrial Air and leadership positions. WK is expected to deliver full year 2024 sales of approximately $15 million with the potential for high-teen EBITDA margins.\n\n“I would like to welcome the WK organization to our portfolio of leading industrial air solutions businesses,” said Mr. Gleason. “Together we will advance our joint capabilities to better serve global customers while penetrating markets with solutions and services from across our diverse enterprise.”\n\n**_Announces Acquisition of Profire Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: PFIE)_**\n\n“I am excited that today we announced the acquisition of Profire in an all-cash transaction that we expect will close in January 2025. Profire expects to generate approximately $60 million in revenues with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20 percent in the full year 2024. With an installed base approaching 100,000 burner management systems and a growing industrial market product offering, we look forward to accelerating their global market expansion and introducing their high-efficiency solutions to more customers in the industrial air and water markets. We are confident the increased scale and combined corporate organizations will generate meaningful efficiencies and synergies. The addition of Profire is another important step in our ongoing execution of programmatic M&A and we expect it will further advance our position as the leading environmental solutions provider in industrial markets,” added Mr. Gleason.\n\n**_Updates 2024 Full Year Guidance_**\n\nThe Company updated its 2024 full year revenue guidance to reflect revenue between $575 and $600 million, up approximately 10 percent year over year at the midpoint of the range, and adjusted EBITDA between $65 to $70 million, up approximately 17 percent year over year, at the midpoint of the range. The updated expected full year guidance compares to the previous outlook for revenues of between $600 to $620 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $68 to $72 million. The Company expects 2024 full year bookings guidance to reflect a book to bill rate of or in excess of 1.2x, up from a previous range of 1.05x to 1.1x. The Company maintains its full year outlook for free cash flow of 50% to 70% of adjusted EBITDA.\n\n“Our updated full year 2024 guidance essentially mirrors the initial outlook we provided as we entered 2024. As previously mentioned, unfortunately, the customer-driven delays associated with a handful of larger projects impacted our ability to hit the raised guidance we issued mid-year. This is the first time we have reduced guidance in company history, and although this is disappointing for our short-term results, we remain very pleased with our bookings, margin expansion progress and overall execution. Additionally, the revenue and associated income from the 2024 project delays slide into upcoming quarters, so we remain focused on execution and controlling factors we can influence,” said Mr. Gleason.\n\n**_Introduces 2025 Full Year Guidance_**\n\nThe Company introduced its 2025 full year guidance to reflect revenue between $700 and $750 million, up approximately 25 percent at the midpoint of the range, and adjusted EBITDA between $90 and $100 million, up approximately 40% at the midpoint of the range. The Company expects full year free cash flow of between 50% to 70% of adjusted EBITDA.\n\nMr. Gleason concluded, “Our full year 2025 outlook reflects the visibility we have with our record backlog, ongoing strong bookings, 2024 related project push outs, and the impact from already completed acquisitions and the pending transaction with Profire. We continue to drive an aggressive operating model that supports strong organic growth, coupled with steady margin expansion and additions from accretive and strategic acquisitions.”\n\n**EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call is scheduled for today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results.

A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is a numerical measure of a company's historical financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, as we present them in the financial data included in this press release, have been adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization expenses for acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent retention and earnout expenses, restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance and legal expenses, acquisition and integration expenses which include retention, legal, accounting, banking, and other expenses, foreign currency remeasurement and other nonrecurring or infrequent items and the associated tax benefit of these items. Management believes that these items are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations and their exclusion provides individuals with additional information to better compare the Company's results over multiple periods. Management utilizes this information to evaluate its ongoing financial performance. Our financial statements may continue to be affected by items similar to those excluded in the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that all such costs are unusual or infrequent.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of CECO’s results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, CECO cautions investors that non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow stated in the tables above are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nNon-GAAP measures presented on a forward-looking basis were not reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial measures because the reconciliation could not be performed without unreasonable efforts. The GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP measures. Such items may include amortization expenses for acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent retention and earnout expenses, restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance and legal expenses, acquisition and integration expenses which include retention, legal, accounting, banking, and other expenses, foreign currency remeasurement and other nonrecurring or infrequent items and the associated tax benefit of these items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results.\n\n**SAFE HARBOR**\n\nAny statements contained in this Press Release, other than statements of historical fact, including statements about management’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, and should be evaluated as such. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. We use words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intends,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “will,” “plan,” “should” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Potential risks and uncertainties, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed under “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and may be included in subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and include, but are not limited to: the parties’ ability to complete the proposed Profire transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Profire transaction agreement between the parties, the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed Profire transaction on business relationships, operating results, and business generally, disruption of current plans and operations and potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the proposed Profire transaction, diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations as a result of the Profire transaction, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted related to the proposed Profire transaction, the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and other charges related to the proposed Profire transaction, the risk that competing offers or acquisition proposals will be made, the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the Profire transaction, the ability of Profire to achieve its 2024 earnings guidance, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize the synergies from acquisitions, the sensitivity of our business to economic and financial market conditions generally and economic conditions in our service areas; dependence on fixed price contracts and the risks associated therewith, including actual costs exceeding estimates and method of accounting for revenue; the effect of growth on our infrastructure, resources, and existing sales; the ability to expand operations in both new and existing markets; the potential for contract delay or cancellation as a result of on-going or worsening supply chain challenges; liabilities arising from faulty services or products that could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty, or other claims; changes in or developments with respect to any litigation or investigation; failure to meet timely completion or performance standards that could result in higher cost and reduced profits or, in some cases, losses on projects; the potential for fluctuations in prices for manufactured components and raw materials, including as a result of tariffs and surcharges, and rising energy costs; inflationary pressures relating to rising raw material costs and the cost of labor; the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with our strategic transactions and our ability to repay or refinance it or incur additional debt in the future; the impact of federal, state or local government regulations; our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and the amounts and timing of repurchases, if any; our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring program; our ability to successfully identify acquisition targets, integrate acquired businesses and realize the synergies from strategic transactions; and the unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including cyber security threats, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities or public health crises, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. Many of these risks are beyond management’s ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made. Except as required under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Yjk0NDg3MjUtZmM4NS00ZjczLThhM2UtZTY4NjZhMmM4MDc0LTEwMTcwNzk=/tiny/CECO-Environmental-Corp-.png)\n\nSearch Investors\n\nSearch this site\n\nSubmit\n"

(Nasdaq: CECO) (“CECO”), a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company whose solutions protect people, the environment and industrial equipment, and Profire Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: PFIE) (“Profire”), a technology company providing solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, today announced a definitive agreement where CECO will acquire Profire, in an all-cash transaction.\n\nProfire is a leader in burner management technology and combustion control systems that provide mission-critical combustion automation and control solutions and services to improve environmental efficiency, safety and reliability for industrial thermal applications globally. Profire estimates its 2024 sales to be greater than $60 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20 percent.\n\n“I am excited to announce the acquisition of Profire and we look forward to welcoming their tremendous organization to our portfolio of leading solution companies,” said Todd Gleason, CECO’s Chief Executive Officer. “With an installed base approaching 100,000 burner management systems and a growing industrial market product offering, we look forward to accelerating their global market expansion and introducing their high-efficiency solutions to more customers in industrial air and water. We are also confident that the increased scale and combined corporate organizations will generate meaningful efficiencies and synergies. The addition of Profire is another important step in our ongoing execution of programmatic M&A and we expect it will further advance our position as the leading environmental solutions provider in industrial markets.”\n\n“We are extremely pleased to announce this transaction with CECO which is a testament to the value that has been created for Profire employees, customers and shareholders,” said Cameron Tidball and Ryan Oviatt, co-CEOs of Profire. “The combination of our well-established leadership in niche energy and industrial mission critical applications with CECO’s proven track record of acquiring and investing in companies to enhance their growth and create scale will unlock even more value for all constituents.”\n\n**Transaction Details and Timing**\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of CECO (“Merger Sub”) will commence a tender offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Profire common stock at a price of $2.55 per share, in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding tax. The tender offer will initially remain open for 20 business days from the date of commencement of the tender offer, subject to extension under certain circumstances. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by Profire’s Board of Directors, implies an equity value of approximately $125 million and a total enterprise value for Profire of approximately $108 million.\n\nThe tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including that at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Profire’s common stock are tendered and not withdrawn in the tender offer and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\n\nThe price represents a 46.5% premium over Profire’s closing share price of $1.74 on October 25, 2024 and a premium of 60.3% to Profire’s 30-day volume weighted average share price on October 25, 2024.\n\nFollowing a successful completion of the tender offer, including the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, CECO will acquire all remaining untendered shares of Profire common stock at the same price of $2.55 per share in cash through a merger of Merger Sub with Profire, with Profire continuing as the surviving corporation.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, Profire will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CECO and shares of Profire’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market. The parties anticipate that the combination will be completed in the first quarter of 2025. \n\n**Advisors**\n\nStephens Inc. is serving as financial advisor and Mayer Brown LLP is serving as legal counsel to Profire.CECO Environmental Corp. is being advised by Foley & Lardner LLP (Legal), and KPMG (tax).\n\n**ABOUT CECO ENVIRONMENTAL** CECO Environmental is a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company, serving a broad landscape of industrial air, industrial water, and energy transition markets across the globe through its key business segments: Engineered Systems and Industrial Process Solutions.
