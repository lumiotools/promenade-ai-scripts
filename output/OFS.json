See additional information under “Results of Operations” below. \n  * Net asset value per common share decreased to $11.29 as of September 30, 2024 from $11.51 as of June 30, 2024. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, based on fair value, 91% of our loan portfolio consisted of floating rate loans and 100% of our loan portfolio consisted of first lien and second lien loans. \n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the investment portfolio’s weighted-average performing income yield increased to 13.6% from 13.4% during the prior quarter, primarily due to the sale of certain structured finance securities and the redeployment of proceeds into higher yielding CLO subordinated note securities. \n  * The number of issuers with loans on non-accrual status, and the percentage of non-accrual investments to total investments at fair value, remained stable quarter-over-quarter. See additional information under “Portfolio and Investment Activities” below. \n\n\n\n**OTHER RECENT EVENTS**\n\n  * On October 29, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2024, payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2024. \n\n\n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (unaudited)** |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(Per common share)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \n**Net Investment Income**  \nNet investment income  |  $  |  0.27  |  $  |  0.26   \n**Net Realized/Unrealized Gain (Loss)**  \nNet realized loss on investments, net of taxes  |  $  |  (0.83  |  )  |  $  |  (0.32  |  )   \nNet unrealized appreciation on investments, net of taxes  |  0.68  |  0.83   \nNet realized/unrealized gain (loss)  |  $  |  (0.15  |  )  |  $  |  0.51   \n**Earnings (Loss)**  \nEarnings (loss)  |  $  |  0.12  |  $  |  0.77   \n**Net Asset Value**  \nNet asset value  |  $  |  11.29  |  $  |  11.51   \nDistributions paid  |  $  |  0.34  |  $  |  0.34   \n  \n**As of**  \n---  \n(in millions)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \n**Balance Sheet Highlights (unaudited)**  \nInvestment portfolio, at fair value  |  $  |  394.7  |  $  |  398.2   \nTotal assets  |  418.5  |  407.9   \nNet assets  |  151.3  |  154.2   \n  \n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES** _($ in millions)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**Portfolio Yields(1)** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \nAverage performing interest-bearing investments, at cost  |  $  |  309.4  |  $  |  322.6   \nWeighted-average performing income yield - interest-bearing investments(2) |  13.6  |  %  |  13.4  |  %   \nWeighted-average realized yield - interest-bearing investments(3) |  11.8  |  %  |  11.8  |  %   \n  \n(1)  |  The weighted-average yield of our investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders, but rather relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Performing income yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on performing interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of net loan fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total performing interest-bearing investments at amortized cost.   \n(3)  |  Realized yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of net loan fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total interest-bearing investments at amortized cost, in each case, including debt investments on non-accrual status and non-income producing structured finance securities.   \n  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**Portfolio Purchase Activity** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \nInvestments in debt and equity investments  |  $  |  30.4  |  $  |  5.0   \nInvestments in structured finance securities  |  18.0  |  —   \nTotal investment purchases and originations  |  $  |  48.4  |  $  |  5.0   \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, based on fair value, our investment portfolio was comprised of the following: \n\n  * Total investments of $394.7 million, which was equal to approximately 106% of amortized cost; \n  * Debt investments of $231.1 million, of which approximately 82% and 18% were first lien and second lien loans, respectively; \n  * Equity investments of $89.8 million; and \n  * Structured finance securities of $73.8 million. \n\n\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a first lien debt investment with an amortized cost and fair value of $4.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, was placed on non-accrual status. \n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we wrote-off a subordinated debt investment, which was previously on non-accrual status, following a partial-recovery payment of $0.3 million, resulting in a net realized loss of $4.4 million. The net realized loss of $4.4 million was fully recognized in prior fiscal periods as an unrealized loss and did not impact our NAV during the quarter. \n\n**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited)**  \n---  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024**  \n**Total investment income** |  $  |  10,918  |  $  |  11,165   \nExpenses:   \nInterest expense  |  4,022  |  4,117   \nBase management and incentive fees  |  2,373  |  2,337   \nProfessional, administration and other expenses  |  920  |  1,274   \n**Total expenses** |  7,315  |  7,728   \nNet investment income  |  3,603  |  3,437   \n**Net gain (loss) on investments** |  (1,915  |  )  |  6,891   \n**Net increase in net assets resulting from operations** |  $  |  1,688  |  $  |  10,328   \n  \n**_Investment Income_**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total investment income decreased to $10.9 million from $11.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $0.2 million. The decline in interest income was primarily due to an aggregate decrease of $0.5 million in contractual cash and PIK interest, partially offset by an increase in accretion of interest income on CLO subordinated notes of $0.4 million. \n\n**_Expenses_**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total expenses decreased by $0.4 million to $7.3 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to decreases in other expenses of $0.2 million and administration fees of $0.1 million. \n\n**_Net Gain (Loss) on Investments_**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss on investments of $1.9 million, primarily comprised of aggregate net losses of $5.6 million on our loan and structured finance securities, and partially offset by net gains of $3.7 million on our equity securities. \n\nThe net realized and unrealized loss of $1.9 million includes a total net realized loss of $11.1 million, predominantly comprised of a $7.8 million loss upon the write-off of our debt and equity investments in a portfolio company, which had no impact on our NAV during the quarter as the loss had been substantially recognized in prior fiscal periods. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $20.3 million in cash, which includes $8.0 million held by OFSCC-FS, LLC (“OFSCC-FS”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. Our use of cash held by OFSCC-FS is restricted by contractual conditions of our credit facility with BNP Paribas, including limitations on the amount of cash OFSCC-FS can distribute to us. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance and an unused commitment of $25.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility with Banc of California, as well as an unused commitment of $80.9 million under our revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas, both of which are subject to borrowing base requirements and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we had a payable for investments purchased of $14.7 million and outstanding commitments to fund various undrawn revolvers and other credit facilities of portfolio companies totaling $8.5 million. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nOFS Capital will host a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, November 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.

The number of issuers with loans on non-accrual status decreased by one from the prior quarter. \n\n\n\n**OTHER RECENT EVENTS**\n\n  * On July 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per common share for the third quarter of 2024, payable on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 20, 2024. \n\n\n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (unaudited)** |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(Per common share)  |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024**  \n**Net Investment Income**  \nNet investment income  |  $  |  0.26  |  $  |  0.42   \n**Net Realized/Unrealized Gain (Loss)**  \nNet realized gain (loss) on investments, net of taxes  |  $  |  (0.32  |  )  |  $  |  0.06   \nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, net of taxes  |  0.83  |  (1.15  |  )   \nNet realized/unrealized gain (loss)  |  $  |  0.51  |  $  |  (1.09  |  )   \n**Earnings (Loss)**  \nEarnings (loss)  |  $  |  0.77  |  $  |  (0.67  |  )   \n**Net Asset Value**  \nNet asset value  |  $  |  11.51  |  $  |  11.08   \nDistributions paid  |  $  |  0.34  |  $  |  0.34   \n**As of**  \n(in millions)  |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024**  \n**Balance Sheet Highlights (unaudited)**  \nInvestment portfolio, at fair value  |  $  |  398.2  |  $  |  400.4   \nTotal assets  |  407.9  |  410.5   \nNet assets  |  154.2  |  148.4   \n  \n“We are pleased to announce an increase in our net asset value per common share to $11.51 as of June 30, 2024 from $11.08 as of March 31, 2024,” said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that we continue to benefit from our balance sheet positioning, with the vast majority of our loan portfolio being floating rate and the majority of our debt being fixed-rate.” \n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES** _($ in millions)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**Portfolio Yields(1)** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024**  \nAverage performing interest-bearing investments, at cost  |  $  |  322.6  |  $  |  338.0   \nWeighted-average performing income yield - interest-bearing investments(2) |  13.4  |  %  |  13.0  |  %   \nWeighted-average realized yield - interest-bearing investments(3) |  11.8  |  %  |  11.6  |  %   \n  \n(1)  |  The weighted-average yield of our investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders, but rather relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Performing income yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on performing interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of net loan fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total performing interest-bearing investments at amortized cost.   \n(3)  |  Realized yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of net loan fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total interest-bearing investments at amortized cost, in each case, including debt investments on non-accrual status and non-income producing structured finance securities.   \n  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**Portfolio Purchase Activity** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024**  \nInvestments in debt and equity investments  |  $  |  5.0  |  $  |  7.3   \nInvestments in structured finance securities  |  —  |  —   \nTotal investment purchases and originations  |  $  |  5.0  |  $  |  7.3   \n  \nAs of June 30, 2024, based on fair value, our investment portfolio was comprised of the following: \n\n  * Total investments of $398.2 million, which was equal to approximately 103% of amortized cost;

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we redeemed $31.9 million of SBA debentures and reduced the total amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas by $12.0 million. \n\n**_Net Gain (Loss) on Investments_**\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we recognized a net loss on investments of $14.6 million, comprised of net unrealized depreciation of $15.4 million, partially offset by net realized gains of $0.8 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, net unrealized depreciation of $15.4 million was primarily due to declines in a couple of portfolio companies. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $6.1 million in cash, which includes $2.5 million held by OFSCC-FS, LLC (“OFSCC-FS”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. Our use of cash held by OFSCC-FS is restricted by contractual conditions of our credit facility with BNP Paribas, including limitations on the amount of cash OFSCC-FS can distribute to us. \n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had no outstanding balance and an unused commitment of $25.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility with Banc of California, as well as an unused commitment of $71.5 million under its revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas, both of which are subject to borrowing base requirements and other covenants. As of March 31, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to fund portfolio company investments totaling $10.9 million under various undrawn revolvers and other credit facilities. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nOFS Capital will host a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, May 3, 2024, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.

No new non-accrual loans during the fourth quarter. \n  * Net asset value (“NAV”) per common share decreased from $12.74 at September 30, 2023 to $12.09 at December 31, 2023. \n  * As of December 31, 2023, based on fair value, 92% of our loan portfolio consisted of floating rate loans and 100% of our loan portfolio consisted of first and second lien loans. \n  * The weighted-average performing income yield of our investment portfolio decreased from 14.6% during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 14.1% during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a net decline in non-recurring income. \n\n\n\n**OTHER RECENT EVENTS**\n\n  * On February 28, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per common share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on March 28, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024. \n  * On March 1, 2024, OFS SBIC I, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary, fully repaid its outstanding SBA debentures totaling $31.9 million that were contractually due March 1, 2025, and requested the approval of the SBA to surrender its license to operate as a small business investment company. \n\n\n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (unaudited)** |  **Quarter Ended**  \n---|---  \n(Per common share)  |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net Investment Income**  \nNet investment income  |  $  |  0.35  |  $  |  0.40   \n**Net Realized/Unrealized Gain (Loss)**  \nNet realized gain (loss) on investments, net of taxes  |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  0.01   \nNet unrealized depreciation on investments, net of taxes  |  (0.58  |  )  |  (0.26  |  )   \nLoss on extinguishment of debt  |  —  |  (0.01  |  )   \nNet realized and unrealized loss  |  $  |  (0.66  |  )  |  $  |  (0.26  |  )   \n**Earnings (Loss)**  \nEarnings (loss)  |  $  |  (0.31  |  )  |  $  |  0.14   \n**Net Asset Value**  \nNet asset value  |  $  |  12.09  |  $  |  12.74   \nDistributions paid  |  0.34  |  0.34   \n  \n**As of**  \n---  \n(in millions)  |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Balance Sheet Highlights** |  **(unaudited)**  \nInvestment portfolio, at fair value  |  $  |  420.3  |  $  |  457.2   \nTotal assets  |  469.8  |  477.0   \nNet assets  |  162.0  |  170.7   \n  \n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We are pleased to announce that net investment income for the fourth quarter exceeded the quarterly distribution paid,” said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that we continue to benefit from the current interest rate environment with the vast majority of our loan portfolio being floating rate and the majority of our debt being fixed-rate.” \n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES** ($ in millions)   \n---  \n**As of and for the Quarter Ended**  \n**Portfolio Overview** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nAverage performing interest-bearing investments, at cost  |  $  |  357.9  |  $  |  388.5   \nWeighted-average performing income yield - interest-bearing investments(1) |  14.1  |  %  |  14.6  |  %   \nWeighted-average realized yield - interest-bearing investments(2) |  12.8  |  %  |  13.3  |  %   \n  \n(1)  |  Performing income yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on performing interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of net loan fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total performing interest-bearing investments at amortized cost.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Realized yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of net loan fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total interest-bearing investments at amortized cost, in each case, including debt investments on non-accrual status and non-income producing structured finance securities.   \n  \n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**_Portfolio Activity_** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nInvestments in debt and equity investments  |  $  |  7.0  |  $  |  0.7   \nInvestments in structured finance securities  |  —  |  7.6   \nTotal investment purchases and originations  |  $  |  7.0  |  $  |  8.3   \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, based on fair value, our investment portfolio was comprised of the following: \n\n  * Total investments of $420.3 million, which was equal to approximately 104% of amortized cost; \n  * Debt investments of $251.3 million, of which 81% and 19% were first lien loans and second lien loans, respectively; \n  * Equity investments of $89.9 million; \n  * Structured finance securities of $79.0 million; and \n  * Unfunded commitments of $13.8 million to 10 portfolio companies. \n\n\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a previous non-accrual loan was returned to accrual status and no new loans were placed on non-accrual status. \n\n**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited)**  \n---  \n(in thousands)  |  **Quarter Ended**  \n**December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nTotal investment income  |  $  |  13,483  |  $  |  14,651   \nExpenses:   \nInterest expense  |  4,684  |  4,913   \nBase management and incentive fees  |  2,819  |  3,144   \nOther expenses  |  1,284  |  1,204   \nTotal expenses  |  8,787  |  9,261   \nNet investment income  |  4,696  |  5,390   \n**Net loss on investments** |  (8,805  |  )  |  (3,395  |  )   \nLoss on extinguishment of debt  |  —  |  (194  |  )   \n**Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations** |  $  |  (4,109  |  )  |  $  |  1,801   \n  \n**_Investment Income_**\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, total investment income decreased by $1.2 million as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total investment income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $1.4 million, driven by a net decline in non-recurring income and a decrease in our average total investments at cost. \n\n**_Expenses_**\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, total expenses decreased by $0.5 million as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total expenses was primarily due to a decrease in base management and incentives fees of $0.3 million and a decrease in interest expense of $0.2 million related to lower average outstanding debt balances. \n\n**_Net Gain (Loss) on Investments_**\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net loss on investments of $8.8 million was primarily due to unrealized depreciation on a few issuer-specific portfolio companies and broader declines on our structured finance securities. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $45.3 million of cash, which included $4.0 million held in OFSCC-FS, LLC (“OFSCC-FS”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. Our use of cash held by OFSCC-FS is restricted by contractual conditions of its credit facility with BNP Paribas, including limitations on the amount of cash OFSCC-FS can distribute to us. As of December 31, 2023, OFS SBIC I, LP had cash of $28.0 million. See “Other Recent Events” above. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had an unused commitment of $25.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility with Banc of California (the “Banc of California Credit Facility”), as well as an unused commitment of $59.5 million under the revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas, both of which are subject to borrowing base requirements and other covenants. \n\nOn December 15, 2023, we amended the Banc of California Credit Facility to: (i) extend the maturity date from February 28, 2024 to February 28, 2026; (ii) increase the interest rate floor from 4.00% to 5.00%; and (iii) eliminate the 0.50% unused line fee and replace it with an annual commitment fee of 0.50%. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nOFS Capital will host a conference call to discuss these results on Tuesday, March 5, 2024, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.
