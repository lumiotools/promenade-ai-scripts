(Nasdaq:CLPT) (the \"Company\"), a global therapy-enabling platform company providing navigation and delivery to the brain, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted marketing authorization for the SmartFlow Neuro Cannula using the De Novo pathway. The SmartFlow Neuro Cannula is intended for intraputaminal administration of PTC Therapeutics' gene therapy KEBILIDI™ (eladocagene exuparvovec-tneq) for the treatment of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency. This signifies the first-ever FDA marketing authorization of a device used to deliver gene therapy directly to regions of interest within the brain.\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/b0bac42e-c664-4d26-9ca9-90af48a3ae88/942290/c6a1bf920fd014ca3880eba86da4.jpg?v=1)\n\n\"Today is one of the most important strategic milestones in the history of our company,\" commented Joe Burnett, President and CEO at ClearPoint Neuro. \"FDA's granting of this De Novo classification is the culmination of years of disciplined co-development, creative problem solving, and tireless efforts. We could not be prouder of the PTC and ClearPoint Teams and how we have worked together. Most importantly, we are thrilled and humbled that children with this terrible disease will now be treated with the first-ever neuro gene therapy available commercially in the United States.\"\n\n\"I am proud to have served as a PI in the trial supporting today's landmark approvals,\" stated Dr. Daniel Curry, Director, Functional Neurosurgery and Epilepsy Surgery at Texas Children's Hospital and Professor, Neurosurgery and Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I have witnessed first-hand the positive impact these treatments have had on children with AADC Deficiency. Neurosurgeons are leading the way in this promising field to address the underlying genetic cause, and not just the symptoms, of devastating neurological disorders by delivering gene therapy directly to targets in the brain through dedicated platforms.\"\n\n\"Today's De Novo approval will give confidence to all our current and future biopharma partners that ClearPoint has the experience to help their cell and gene therapies cross the finish line,\" commented Jeremy Stigall, Chief Business Officer and Biologics and Drug Delivery Leader at ClearPoint Neuro. \"We offer a complete medical device solution so that our pharma partners can concentrate on the development of their drug and trust us to handle all aspects related to delivery. We are effectively a medical device division that works on behalf of pharma partners, providing surgical strategy, benchtop testing, compatibility assessments, pre-clinical study management, clinical trial support, precise navigation, infusion monitoring software, and a routinely audited quality management system and manufacturing processes. Furthermore, we can customize devices for new routes of administration that leverage our unique intellectual property and experience with the FDA to co-develop products that are ideally suited to different cell and gene therapy suspensions and different targets in the brain and spine. More than anything, we offer our partners a head start, and now have proof that we can take these projects to commercial clearance.\"\n\n\"This pioneering treatment has the potential to truly transform the standard of care for children with this disorder and this platform holds promise for many other conditions,\" said Dr. Gerald A. Grant, The Allan H. Friedman Distinguished Professor of Neurosurgery, Chair of the Dept. of Neurosurgery at Duke University. \"I feel so privileged to have been part of this clinical trial team and am hopeful that this innovation will open doors for treating many other conditions. The power of hope is so impactful for these children and their families.\"\n\n**About aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency**\n\nAADC deficiency is a fatal, rare genetic disorder that typically causes severe disability and suffering from the first months of life, affecting every aspect of life-physical, mental and behavioral. The suffering of children with AADC deficiency may be exacerbated by episodes of distressing seizure-like oculogyric crises causing the eyes to roll up in the head, frequent vomiting, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping.\n\nThe lives of affected children are severely impacted and shortened. Ongoing physical, occupational and speech therapy, and interventions, including surgery, also are often required to manage potentially life-threatening complications such as infections, severe feeding and breathing problems.\n\n**About the SmartFlow Neuro Cannula** With over 8,000 cannulas sold to date, SmartFlow is the only co-labeled device to gain approval by regulatory bodies in both the U.S. and EU for delivery of an approved gene therapy to the brain. The industry-leading cannula is used by many of ClearPoint Neuro's 50+ pharmaceutical, academic, and biotech partners to bypass the blood brain barrier and deliver therapeutics to regions of interest using Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) under direct image guidance. The SmartFlow Neuro Cannula has received De Novo FDA approval for the intraputaminal administration of the gene therapy KEBILIDI™ (eladocagene exuparvovec-tneq) for the treatment of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency. SmartFlow is also 510(k) cleared by the FDA for use in the United States for the aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid or injection of the chemotherapy drug Cytarabine into the ventricles. The cannula is CE marked to deliver cytarabine and other approved fluids into the brain or perform aspiration of CSF. SmartFlow is being utilized in approved clinical and preclinical studies for various research and drug trials.\n\n**_About ClearPoint Neuro_**\n\nClearPoint Neuro is a device, cell, and gene therapy-enabling company offering precise navigation to the brain and spine.

(Nasdaq:CLPT) (the \"Company\"), a global device, cell, and gene therapy-enabling company offering precise navigation to the brain and spine, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Reported quarterly revenue of $8.1 million, a 41% year-over-year increase;\n\n  * Accelerated growth of SmartFrame OR™ platform and ClearPoint Prism® Laser Therapy System, contributing to record navigation and device revenue of $2.9 million, a 53% year-over-year increase;\n\n  * Overall product revenue, including biologics and drug delivery, more than doubled year-over-year, growing 127% to $5.5 million;\n\n  * Activated five new global centers in the third quarter for a total of 19 new centers so far this year; approximately three times our historic activation rate;\n\n  * Continued patient enrollment in numerous cell and gene therapy trials for partners selected in FDA expedited review programs across multiple indications;\n\n  * Full early repayment of the principal amount and interest on a $10 million convertible note leaving the Company with no outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024;\n\n  * Quarterly operational cash burn reduced to $1.2 million, a 33% year-over-year decrease; and\n\n  * Reported cash and cash equivalents totaling $21.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\"The third quarter of 2024 was another example of continued execution of our four-pillar growth strategy, yielding another record revenue quarter, 41% topline growth, and further reduction in operational cash burn as we scale the business,\" commented Joe Burnett, President and CEO at ClearPoint Neuro. \"Our growth continues to be fueled by (i) our 2024 new-product introductions including the SmartFrame OR Navigation system expanding our footprint into the Operating Room, (ii) the ongoing adoption of the PRISM laser therapy system expanding our participation in an existing therapy segment, and (iii) the expansion of our pre-clinical capabilities increasing the depth of our biopharma relationships as we work to co-develop tools and techniques to enhance neuro drug delivery. We expect all three of these new growth vectors to continue into 2025 and to be complemented by additional FDA and CE Mark submissions in the months ahead. The expanding range of our versatile and innovative portfolio of products and services, well beyond MRI Navigation, has been very well received and is evidenced by our accelerated customer activation rate in 2024. We currently have more than 90 active global customers, and a strong pipeline of potential new global activation sites for 2025 and beyond.\"\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe Company reaffirms its full year 2024 revenue outlook of between $30.0 and $33.0 million.\n\n**Financial Results - Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nTotal revenue was $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 41%.\n\nBiologics and Drug Delivery revenue, which includes sales of services and disposable products related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products, increased 27% to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $3.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our overall revenue growth is attributable to a $1.6 million increase in product revenue resulting from higher demand for disposables as multiple partners progress in their trials, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in service and other revenue due to a reduction in the number of preclinical studies performed.\n\nNeurosurgery Navigation and Therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 49% to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is driven by higher product revenue of $1.0 million resulting from newly activated accounts, increased case count, and new product offerings, including the SmartFrame OR and Prism Laser Therapy, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nCapital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, increased 133% to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $0.4 million for the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the placements of ClearPoint navigation capital and software and Prism laser units. The total number of newly activated accounts increased by five in the quarter and to nineteen for the full year which represents approximately three times the historic activation rate.\n\nGross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 60% compared to a gross margin of 57% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $10.0 million, compared to $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was mainly driven by higher personnel costs and product development costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense as a result of recoveries.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $21.6 million as compared to $23.1 million at December 31, 2023, with the decrease resulting from the full repayment of debt of $10.0 million and the use of cash in operating activities of $7.7 million in the nine month period ending September 30, 2024, partially offset by the net proceeds from the public offering of common stock of $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**Teleconference Information**\n\nInvestors and analysts are invited to listen to a live broadcast review of the Company's 2024 third quarter on Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) which may be accessed online here: [https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=Yl0JL1Mt](https://pr.report/436q).

(Nasdaq:CLPT) (the \"Company\"), a global device, cell, and gene therapy-enabling company offering precise navigation to the brain and spine, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Reported quarterly revenue of $8.1 million, a 41% year-over-year increase;\n\n  * Accelerated growth of SmartFrame OR™ platform and ClearPoint Prism® Laser Therapy System, contributing to record navigation and device revenue of $2.9 million, a 53% year-over-year increase;\n\n  * Overall product revenue, including biologics and drug delivery, more than doubled year-over-year, growing 127% to $5.5 million;\n\n  * Activated five new global centers in the third quarter for a total of 19 new centers so far this year; approximately three times our historic activation rate;\n\n  * Continued patient enrollment in numerous cell and gene therapy trials for partners selected in FDA expedited review programs across multiple indications;\n\n  * Full early repayment of the principal amount and interest on a $10 million convertible note leaving the Company with no outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024;\n\n  * Quarterly operational cash burn reduced to $1.2 million, a 33% year-over-year decrease; and\n\n  * Reported cash and cash equivalents totaling $21.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\"The third quarter of 2024 was another example of continued execution of our four-pillar growth strategy, yielding another record revenue quarter, 41% topline growth, and further reduction in operational cash burn as we scale the business,\" commented Joe Burnett, President and CEO at ClearPoint Neuro. \"Our growth continues to be fueled by (i) our 2024 new-product introductions including the SmartFrame OR Navigation system expanding our footprint into the Operating Room, (ii) the ongoing adoption of the PRISM laser therapy system expanding our participation in an existing therapy segment, and (iii) the expansion of our pre-clinical capabilities increasing the depth of our biopharma relationships as we work to co-develop tools and techniques to enhance neuro drug delivery. We expect all three of these new growth vectors to continue into 2025 and to be complemented by additional FDA and CE Mark submissions in the months ahead. The expanding range of our versatile and innovative portfolio of products and services, well beyond MRI Navigation, has been very well received and is evidenced by our accelerated customer activation rate in 2024. We currently have more than 90 active global customers, and a strong pipeline of potential new global activation sites for 2025 and beyond.\"\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe Company reaffirms its full year 2024 revenue outlook of between $30.0 and $33.0 million.\n\n**Financial Results - Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nTotal revenue was $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 41%.\n\nBiologics and Drug Delivery revenue, which includes sales of services and disposable products related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products, increased 27% to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $3.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our overall revenue growth is attributable to a $1.6 million increase in product revenue resulting from higher demand for disposables as multiple partners progress in their trials, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in service and other revenue due to a reduction in the number of preclinical studies performed.\n\nNeurosurgery Navigation and Therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 49% to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is driven by higher product revenue of $1.0 million resulting from newly activated accounts, increased case count, and new product offerings, including the SmartFrame OR and Prism Laser Therapy, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nCapital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, increased 133% to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $0.4 million for the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the placements of ClearPoint navigation capital and software and Prism laser units. The total number of newly activated accounts increased by five in the quarter and to nineteen for the full year which represents approximately three times the historic activation rate.\n\nGross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 60% compared to a gross margin of 57% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $10.0 million, compared to $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was mainly driven by higher personnel costs and product development costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense as a result of recoveries.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $21.6 million as compared to $23.1 million at December 31, 2023, with the decrease resulting from the full repayment of debt of $10.0 million and the use of cash in operating activities of $7.7 million in the nine month period ending September 30, 2024, partially offset by the net proceeds from the public offering of common stock of $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**Teleconference Information**\n\nInvestors and analysts are invited to listen to a live broadcast review of the Company's 2024 third quarter on Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) which may be accessed online here: [https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=Yl0JL1Mt](https://pr.report/436q).

The forward-looking statements relate to our expectations for\nperformance, revenues and costs, and the adequacy of cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments to support operations and meet future obligations. These\nstatements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any\nfuture results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"could,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\"\n\"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain\nthese words. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report, we caution you that these statements\nare based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain.\nIn evaluating forward-looking statements, you should refer to (i) the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023, which we filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 12, 2024 (the \"2023 Form 10-K\"), (ii) Item 2 of this Quarterly Report,\nunder the heading \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\" and\n(iii) Part II, Item 1.A of this Quarterly Report. As a result of these risk factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report will prove to\nbe accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-\nlooking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any\nspecified time frame, or at all.

Description of the Business and Financial Condition\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative platforms for\nperforming minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain. From the Company’s inception in 1998, the Company has deployed significant resources to fund its efforts to\ndevelop the capabilities for enabling neurosurgery interventions, building an intellectual property portfolio, and identifying and building out commercial applications for the\ntechnologies it develops. In 2021, the Company’s efforts expanded beyond the MRI suite to encompass development and commercialization of new neurosurgical device\nproducts for the operating room setting. In 2022, the Company commercialized the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System as its first therapy product offering. The\nCompany has exclusive global commercialization rights to the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System through its Swedish partner, Clinical Laserthermia Systems\n(\"CLS\").\nSince 2021, a growing part of the Company’s revenue is derived from professional services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic institutions, and contract\nresearch organizations having a focus on biologics and drug delivery. The Company’s services include protocol consultation and solutions for preclinical study design and\nexecution for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents to the brain. The Company also partners with customers to develop devices used for administration of therapies into the\ncentral nervous system. Currently, the Company has more than 50 biologics and drug delivery customers who are evaluating or using its products and services in trials to\ninject gene and cell therapies directly into the brain. These relationships involve drug development programs that are at various stages of development ranging from\npreclinical research to late-stage regulatory trials for multiple distinct disease states. This part of the Company’s business potentially represents the largest opportunity for\ngrowth; however, the Company’s ability to grow in this market is dependent on its ability to maintain and establish new relationships with customers, such customers'\ncontinuation of research and product development plans, and such customers' achievement of success in completion of clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approvals of\ntheir biologics and drugs.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nThe Company continues to monitor the impact of various macroeconomic trends, such as global economic and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including\ninstability resulting from military conflicts), labor shortages, inflationary conditions, and legislative and political developments. Impacts from inflationary pressures, such as\nincreasing costs for research and development of the Company's products, administrative and other costs of doing business, and the Company's access to capital markets and\nother sources of funding in the future could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these trends could adversely\naffect the Company's customers, which could impact their willingness to spend on the Company's products and services, or their ability to make payment, which could harm\nthe Company's collection of accounts receivable and financial results. The continued development and fluidity of these situations preclude any prediction as to the ultimate\nimpact they will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred net losses since its inception, which has resulted in a cumulative deficit at September 30, 2024 of $186.0 million. In addition, the Company’s use\nof cash from operations amounted to $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since its\ninception, the Company has financed its operations principally from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of notes payable, however, there is no assurance a future\nsale of equity securities and/or issuance of notes payable will be at terms favorable to the Company or available at all. As required by generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the U.S., the Company has evaluated its ability to continue as a going concern and has determined that based on current forecasts, existing cash and cash\nequivalent balances at September 30, 2024 are sufficient to support the Company's operations and meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 2,653,848 shares of its common stock from which the net proceeds totaled approximately $16.2 million after\ndeducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses paid by the Company. See Note 8 below for additional information with respect to the\ncommon stock offering.\n7\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nIn August 2024, the Company repaid in full the remaining $10 million outstanding under a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into in 2020 (the \"SPA\"), pursuant to\nwhich the Company issued secured convertible notes to two investors raising gross proceeds of $25 million, of which $15 million had been previously converted to common\nstock. See Note 6 below for additional information with respect to these notes.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes\nthereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n\"SEC\"). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States (\"U.S. GAAP\") for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC related to a quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nAccordingly, since they are interim statements, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes\nrequired by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity\nfor the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The costs of inventory are determined using the standard cost method, which approximates actual cost based\non a first-in, first-out method. Items in inventory relate predominantly to the Company’s ClearPoint system and related disposables. Software license inventory related to\nClearPoint systems undergoing on-site customer evaluation is included in inventory in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. All other software license\ninventory is classified as a non-current asset. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for excess and obsolete items and provides a reserve upon identification of\npotentially excess or obsolete items.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company is a party to a license agreement that provides rights to the Company for the development and commercialization of products. Under the terms of the license\nagreement, the Company made payments to the licensor upon execution of the license agreement for access to the underlying technology, and future payments will be based\nupon achievement of regulatory and commercialization milestones as defined in the license agreement. In 2022, the Company made a payment to the licensor for the\nachievement of a regulatory milestone, which acts as a prepayment for future royalties.\nIn conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Section (ASC) 350, \"Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,\" the Company amortizes the payments related to the license\nrights described above over an expected useful life of up to five years, or as commercial sales occur that are related to the royalty prepayment. In addition, the Company\nperiodically evaluates the recoverability of its investment in the license rights and records an impairment charge in the event such evaluation indicates that the Company’s\ninvestment is not likely to be recovered.\n8\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue is comprised primarily of: (1) product revenue resulting from the sale of neurosurgery, navigation, therapy, and biologics and drug delivery\ndisposable products; (2) product revenue resulting from the sale of ClearPoint capital equipment and software; (3) service revenue and case support revenue in connection\nwith customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials; (4) license revenue for the granting of licenses to develop and commercialize the Company's SmartFlow Cannula\ndevices with the Company's customers' proprietary biologics as a combination product; and (5) revenue resulting from the service, installation, training, and shipping related\nto ClearPoint capital equipment and software. The Company recognizes revenue when (i) control of the Company’s products is transferred to its customers or (ii) services are\nprovided to customers, each in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive from its customers in exchange for those products and services, in a\nprocess that involves identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the\ntransaction price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance\nobligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are\nreadily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. When a contract calls for the satisfaction of multiple performance obligations for a single contract\nprice, the Company typically allocates the contract price among the performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling prices for each such performance\nobligation customarily charged by the Company. The Company considers a performance obligation satisfied once it has transferred control of a good or service to the\ncustomer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the good or service. The Company recognizes revenue for satisfied performance obligations\nonly when it determines there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control.\nLines of Business; Timing of Revenue Recognition\n• Neurosurgery navigation product, biologics and drug delivery systems product, and therapy product sales: Revenue from the sale of neurosurgery navigation\nproducts (consisting of disposable products sold commercially and related to cases utilizing the Company's ClearPoint system), biologics and drug delivery products\n(consisting primarily of disposable products related to customer-sponsored clinical trials utilizing the ClearPoint system), and therapy products (consisting primarily\nof disposable laser-related products used in neurosurgical procedures) is generally based on customer purchase orders, the predominance of which require delivery\nwithin one week of the order having been placed, and is generally recognized at the point in time of shipping to the customer, which is the point at which legal title,\nand risks and rewards of ownership, transfer to the customer. For certain customers, legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer upon delivery to the\ncustomer as stated in their respective contracts, in which case revenue is recognized upon delivery.\n• Capital equipment and software sales:\n◦ Capital equipment and software sales preceded by evaluation periods: The predominance of capital equipment and software sales (consisting of integrated\ncomputer hardware and software that are integral components of the Company's ClearPoint system) are preceded by customer evaluation periods. During\nthese evaluation periods, installation of, and training of customer personnel on, the systems have been completed and the systems have been in operation.\nAccordingly, revenue from capital equipment and software sales following such evaluation periods is recognized at the point in time that the Company is in\nreceipt of an executed purchase agreement or purchase order.\n◦ Capital equipment and software sales not preceded by evaluation periods: Revenue from sales of capital equipment and software not having been\npreceded by an evaluation period is recognized upon delivery to the customer and installation. For capital equipment that does not require installation,\nrevenue is recognized upon shipment; however, for those customers where legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer upon delivery, revenue is\nrecognized at such time.\nFor both types of capital equipment and software sales described above, the determination of the point in time at which to recognize revenue represents that point at\nwhich the customer has legal title, physical possession, and the risks and rewards of ownership, and the Company has a present right to payment.\n9\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n• Neurosurgery navigation and therapy services: The Company recognizes revenue for such services over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on\nthe extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation.\n• Biologics and drug delivery services and other revenue:\n◦ Professional and Consulting Services: The Company recognizes professional and consulting revenue over time as the services are delivered to the\ncustomer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company may use output methods, such as time elapsed,\nor input methods, such as labor hours expended or costs incurred, to measure progress depending on which better depicts the transfer of control to the\ncustomer.\n◦ Clinical Service Access Fees: For contracts in which the Company receives a periodic fixed fee, irrespective of the number of cases attended by the\nCompany's personnel or hours incurred during such periods, revenue is recognized ratably over the period covered by such fees. A time-elapsed output\nmethod is used for such fees because the Company transfers control evenly by providing a stand-ready service.\n◦ Procedure-Based Service Fees: The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time a relevant case is completed.\n◦ License fees: License fees represent the use of functional intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted and does not\nrequire any significant development or customization. Accordingly, the Company recognizes license revenue at the point in time in which the license\nbecomes effective and the intellectual property is made available to the customer.\n◦ Milestone fees: Event-based payments which are subject to the customer's achievement of specified development or regulatory milestones are included in\nthe transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that these milestones will be achieved and a significant future reversal of cumulative\nrevenue under the contract will not occur. The Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such milestones at the end of each reporting period\nand adjusts the transaction price as necessary.\n• Capital equipment-related services:\n◦ Equipment service: Revenue from service of ClearPoint capital equipment and software previously sold to customers is based on agreements with terms\nranging from one to three years and is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the service agreement. A time-elapsed output method is used\nfor service revenue because the Company transfers control evenly by providing a stand-ready service.\nThe Company may also enter into contracts with customers who own ClearPoint capital equipment, which bundle maintenance and support services and\naccess to software and hardware upgrades made commercially available over the term of the contract, for a single contract price, typically paid on an\nannual basis. The Company allocates the contract price among the performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone prices for each such\nperformance obligation and recognizes the revenue ratably on a monthly basis. A time-elapsed output method is used as the Company is providing a stand-\nready service for each of the performance obligations.\n◦ Installation, training and shipping: Consistent with the Company’s recognition of revenue for capital equipment and software sales as described above,\nfees for installation, training and shipping in connection with sales of capital equipment and software that have been preceded by customer evaluation\nperiods are recognized as revenue at the point in time the Company is in receipt of an executed purchase agreement or purchase order for the equipment and\nsoftware. Installation, training and shipping fees related to capital equipment and software sales not having been preceded by an evaluation period are\nrecognized as revenue concurrent with the recognition of revenue from sales of the related capital equipment.\n10\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company operates in one industry segment, and the predominance of its sales are to U.S.-based customers.\nPayment terms under contracts with customers generally are in a range of 30-60 days after the customers’ receipt of the Company’s invoices.\nThe Company’s terms and conditions do not provide for a right of return unless for: (a) product defects; or (b) other conditions subject to the Company’s approval.\nSee Note 3 for additional information regarding revenue recognition.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the\nsame because the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock equivalents, which comprise the Company’s outstanding common stock options and\nunvested restricted stock units, as described in Note 8, would be anti-dilutive, due to the reporting of a net loss for each of the periods in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nConcentration Risks and Other Risks and Uncertainties\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.\nThe Company may at times invest its excess cash in interest bearing accounts and U.S. government debt securities. It classifies all highly liquid investments with original\nstated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months but\nless than twelve months as short-term investments.\nThe Company holds the remainder of its cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions in the U.S. insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $1.1 million in bank balances that were in excess of the insured limits.\nAt September 30, 2024, there was one customer whose accounts receivable balance represented1 1% of accounts receivable at that date. At December 31, 2023, there were\nfour customers whose accounts receivable balances represented 80% of accounts receivable at that date.\nOne pharmaceutical customer, a related party who is a stockholder and whose chief executive officer is a member of the Company's Board of Directors, for whom the\nCompany provides hardware, software, clinical services and market development services in support of the customer's clinical trials, and from whom the Company earns a\nquarterly fee, accounted for 9% and 12% of total sales in both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was one additional\ncustomer, who comprised 13% of the total sales in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and another customer who comprised1 0% of the total sales in the\nthree-month period ended September 30, 2023.\nPrior to granting credit to a customer, the Company generally performs credit evaluations of the customer's financial condition. In general, the Company does not require\ncollateral from customers in connection with an extension of credit. The accounts receivable balance is reduced by an allowance for credit losses from the potential inability\nof the Company's customers to make required payments. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $0.9 million and $1.4 million,\nrespectively. The Company evaluates the historic loss experience on the accounts receivable balance and also considers separately customers with receivable balances that\nmay be negatively impacted by current economic developments and market conditions. The estimate is a result of the Company's ongoing evaluation of collectability,\ncustomer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses and future expectations.\nThe Company is subject to risks common to emerging companies in the medical device industry, including, but not limited to: new technological innovations; acceptance and\ncompetitiveness of its products; dependence on key personnel; dependence on key suppliers; its ability to maintain its third-party collaboration, license and joint development\npartners, and enter into new relationships; changes in general economic conditions and interest rates; its\n11\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nability to obtain additional funding to support its business; regulatory uncertainty; protection of proprietary technology; compliance with changing government regulations;\nuncertainty of widespread market acceptance of products; access to credit for capital purchases by customers; and intellectual property and product liability claims. Certain\ncomponents used in manufacturing have relatively few alternative sources of supply and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be\naccomplished quickly. The inability of any of these suppliers to fulfill the Company’s supply requirements may negatively impact future operating results.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The amendments improve\nreportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim\ndisclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for\nentities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for calendar year-end public business entities in 2024 annual\nreporting and in 2025 interim reporting. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2023-07 retrospectively in its 2024 annual financial reporting and\nits 2025 interim financial reporting, and is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\" which requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income\ntax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The provisions of the ASU are intended to enhance the transparency and decision\nusefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance may be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively and is effective for calendar\nyear-end public business entities in the 2025 annual period and in 2026 for interim periods with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of\nthis ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\n3.

In most cases, customers are billed upon shipment\nof such products or delivery of such services and the related contract assets, which represent an unconditional right to consideration, comprise the accounts receivable\nbalance. When revenue is recognized in advance of its right to bill and receive consideration, the Company records this unbilled receivable as a contract asset, which is\nclassified as other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts receivable, net $ 3,875 $ 3,211\nOther contract assets\nUnbilled receivables $ 662 $ 733\n• Contract liabilities – Contract liabilities consist of amounts that have been invoiced and for which the Company has the right to bill, but that have not been recognized as\nrevenue as the related goods or services have not been transferred. The Company's contract liabilities are generally comprised of the following: (1) capital equipment and\nsoftware-related service fees that are typically billed and collected at the inception of the service agreements, which have terms ranging from one to three years; (2)\nannual fees for agreements with customers that bundle the capital equipment and software-related service fees with software and hardware upgrades that are made\ncommercially available over the term of the contract; and (3) up-front payments from customers made in connection with consulting services. The unearned portion of all\nsuch fees is classified as deferred revenue.\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDeferred revenues $ 1,732 $ 3,154\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately $0.2 million and $2.2 million of revenue, respectively, which was\npreviously included in deferred revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue that will\nbe recognized as revenue in future periods. The majority of the remaining performance obligations relate to capital equipment and software-related service agreements and the\nupfront\n13\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\npayments discussed under the heading \"Contract Liabilities\" above, which amounted to approximately $1.7 million at September 30, 2024. The Company expects to\nrecognize 71% of this revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.\n4. Fair Value Measurement\nFair value measurements are based on a three-tier hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs\nsuch as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents of $21.6 million and $23.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, is derived using Level 1\ninputs. The cash equivalents are comprised of short-term bank deposits, money market funds, and U.S. Government debt securities with original maturities of three months or\nless, and the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n5. Inventory\nInventory consists of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nRaw materials and work in process $ 5,591 $ 6,466\nSoftware licenses 174 211\nFinished goods 1,294 1,234\nInventory, net, included in current assets 7,059 7,911\nSoftware licenses – non-current 198 386\nTotal $ 7,257 $ 8,297\n6. Note Payable\nIn January 2020, the Company completed a financing transaction with two investors (the \"2020 Convertible Noteholders\"), whereby the Company issued an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $17.5 million of secured convertible notes (the \"First Closing Notes\") pursuant to the SPA, which, unless earlier converted or redeemed, were to mature\non January 29, 2025, and bore interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the three (3)-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and (b) two percent\n(2%), plus (ii) a margin of 2% on the outstanding balance of the First Closing Notes, payable quarterly on the first business day of each calendar quarter. The First Closing\nNotes were convertible at a price of $6.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the SPA and the note agreement, and could not be pre-paid without the consent\nof the noteholder. In May 2021, one of the 2020 Convertible Noteholders (the \"Converting Noteholder\") converted the entire $7.5 million principal amount of such\nConverting Noteholder’s First Closing Note, and related accrued interest of approximately $0.04 million, into 1,256,143 shares of the Company’s common stock.\nIn December 2020, the Company issued the Second Closing Note (as defined in the SPA) to one of the 2020 Convertible Noteholders in an aggregate principal amount of\n$7.5 million. In November 2021, the holder of the Second Closing Note converted the entire $7.5 million principal amount of such note, along with related accrued and\npayment in-kind interest aggregating $0.3 million, into 773,446 shares of the Company's common stock.\nOn August 23, 2024, the Company repaid all amounts owing under the remaining First Closing Note, which included the principal amount of $10 million, and related\naccrued interest of $0.1 million. In connection with the prepayment, the noteholder waived all prohibitions on prepayment of the note, and all collateral securing the note was\nreleased.\n14\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n7. Leases\nThe Company subleases office space in Solana Beach, California, that serves as its corporate headquarters and houses certain management and personnel. The sublease term\ncommenced on December 15, 2020, is set to expire on December 31, 2026, and is renewable for an additional five-year period, at the Company’s option, provided that the\nCompany’s landlord has entered into an extension of its prime lease for the office space that encompasses the Company’s office space for at least five years.\nThe Company leases space in Carlsbad, California, that serves as office space and a manufacturing facility under a lease that commenced on June 1, 2023 and ends on May\n31, 2033. The Company has two options to extend the lease term for thirty-six or sixty months, at the then fair market rental value. Upon establishment of the new\nmanufacturing facility in Carlsbad, the Company terminated its prior manufacturing facility lease in Irvine, California, effective October 2023. The lease termination did not\nhave a material impact to the financial statements.\nThe aforementioned leases are classified as operating leases in conformity with GAAP. The aggregate lease costs, included in general and administrative expense, were $0.2\nmillion for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $0.7 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n8.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based\nupon current expectations and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties. You should review the section titled \"Risk Factors\" appearing in the 2023 Form 10-K and in Part II,\nItem 1.A of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis. In addition, historical results and trends that might appear in this Quarterly Report should not\nbe interpreted as being indicative of future operations.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and commercializes innovative platforms for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain.\nWe have deployed significant resources to fund our efforts to develop the capabilities for enabling neurosurgery interventions, building an intellectual property portfolio, and\nidentifying and building out commercial applications for the technologies developed by our company.\nThe foundational part of our business is providing medical devices for neurosurgery applications. Our primary medical device product, the ClearPoint system, is an integrated\nsystem comprised of hardware components, disposable components, and intuitive, menu-driven software, which is in commercial use globally. The primary applications for the\nClearPoint system are to target and guide the insertion of deep brain stimulation electrodes, biopsy needles, and laser catheters, as well as the delivery of pharmaceuticals into\nthe brain. The ClearPoint system was originally designed for use in an MRI setting. In 2021, we launched the SmartFrame Array Neuro Navigation System and Software, which\nallow for operating room placement of the ClearPoint system, and in 2024, we released the SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System, which allows for complete procedures to be\nperformed in the operating room. In 2022, we commercialized the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System as our first therapy product offering. We have exclusive\nglobal commercialization rights to the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System through our Swedish partner, CLS.\nThe second part of our business is focused on partnerships in the biologics and drug delivery space. Our services include protocol consultation and solutions for preclinical study\ndesign and execution for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents to the brain. We also partner with customers to develop devices used for administration of therapies into the\ncentral nervous system. Currently, we have more than 50 biologics and drug delivery customers who are evaluating or using our products and services in trials to inject gene and\ncell therapies directly into the brain. These partnerships involve drug development programs that are at various stages of development ranging from preclinical research to late-\nstage regulatory trials for multiple distinct disease states. This part of our business potentially represents the largest opportunity for growth; however, our ability to grow in this\nmarket is dependent on our ability to maintain and establish new relationships with customers, such customers' continuation of research and development plans, and such\ncustomers' achievement of success in completion of clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approvals of their biologics and drugs.\nSubstantially all our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relates to (i) sales of our ClearPoint system products and related services and (ii)\nproviding services to our customers in the biologics and drug delivery space. We have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through the sale of equity securities\nand the issuance of notes payable. We have incurred significant losses since our inception in 1998 as we have devoted substantial efforts to research and development. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had accumulated losses of $186.0 million. We may continue to incur operating losses as we expand our ClearPoint system platform, services to our\npharmaceutical and other medical technology customers, and our business generally.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nThe following is a description of factors that may influence our future results of operations, and that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of\noperations.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nWe continue to monitor the impact of various macroeconomic trends, such as global economic and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including instability\nresulting from military conflicts), labor shortages, inflationary\n19\nconditions, and legislative and political developments. Impacts from inflationary pressures, such as increasing costs for research and development of our products,\nadministrative and other costs of doing business, and our access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the future could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Additionally, these trends could adversely affect our customers, which could impact their willingness to spend on our products and services,\nor their ability to make payment, which could harm the Company's collection of accounts receivable and financial results. The continued development and fluidity of these\nsituations precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact they will have on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nRevenue\nIn 2010, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") to market our ClearPoint system in the U.S. for general neurosurgical\nprocedures; in February 2011 and May 2018, we also obtained CE marking for our ClearPoint system and SmartFlow cannula, respectively; and in June 2020, we obtained CE\nmarking for version 2.0 of our ClearPoint software and our Inflexion head fixation frame. In January 2021, we received 510(k) clearance for the SmartFrame Array Neuro\nNavigation System. In September 2022, the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, for which we have exclusive global rights to commercialize, received 510(k)\nclearance through our Swedish partner, CLS. The Prism laser represents the first therapy product we have commercialized. In January 2024, we received 510(k) clearance from\nthe FDA for the SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System.\nIn 2021, we started providing services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology customers for improving outcome predictability and optimizing preclinical and\nclinical workflows. Our expertise is concentrated in benchtop testing, preclinical studies, clinical trial support, regulatory consultation, and over-arching translation from the\npreclinical to the clinical setting to enhance accuracy and precision of drug delivery. In 2024, we expanded our services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology\ncustomers to include development of devices used for administration of therapies into the central nervous system.\nFuture revenue from sales of products and services is difficult to predict and may not be sufficient to offset our continuing research and development expenses and selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses.\nGenerating recurring revenue from the sale of products is an important part of our business model for our ClearPoint system. Our product revenue was approximately $5.5\nmillion and $14.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our service and other revenue was approximately $2.6 million and $9.6\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of which 89% and 92%, respectively, is related to the biologics and drug delivery service line.\nOur revenue recognition policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included above in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly\nReport.\nUnderlying the revenue from sales of products and services to our biologics and drug delivery customers is the number of direct customers and end users of our products and/or\nservices (\"Partners\"). Our Partners consist of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic institutions, and customer-sponsored contract research organizations that are\ndeveloping methods to deliver a wide variety of molecules, genes or proteins to targeted brain tissue or structures that would need to bypass the blood-brain barrier for the\ntreatment of a variety of disorders. This is a novel area in which commercialization must be preceded by FDA-mandated clinical trials, which are expensive and time consuming\nto conduct, and for which the commercial success is uncertain, pending, in part, the outcome of those trials. While our revenue from sales of products and services to our\nbiologics and drug delivery customers is indicative of growth, the number of Partner relationships is also of importance as we recognize the possibility that some Partners’\nresearch will reach commercial success, and others may not. To the extent our Partners achieve commercial success, our expectation is that we will share in such success\nthrough our Partners’ use of our products and services in their delivery of therapies. At September 30, 2024, we had more than 50 Partners, which is similar to the number of\nPartners as of the same date in 2023.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes the direct costs associated with the assembly and purchase of components for neurosurgery navigation products, biologics and drug delivery products,\nnon-neurosurgery therapy products, and ClearPoint capital equipment and software that we have sold, and for which we have recognized the revenue in accordance with our\nrevenue recognition policy, as well as labor hours and materials for the cost of providing preclinical, consulting, and service\n20\nrevenue. Cost of revenue also includes the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and depreciation of loaned systems installed under our ClearPoint placement program, as\nwell as provisions for obsolete, impaired, or excess inventory.\nResearch and Development Costs\nOur research and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the conceptualization, design, testing, and prototyping of our ClearPoint system products and\nenhancements. Such costs include salaries, travel, and benefits for research and development personnel; materials and laboratory supplies in research and development\nactivities; outside consultant costs; and licensing costs related to technology not yet commercialized. We anticipate that, over time, our research and development costs may\nincrease as we: (i) develop devices and services for delivery of therapeutics into the central nervous system; (ii) expand products into the operating room and therapeutics space;\nand (iii) expand the application of our technological platforms internationally.\nProduct development timelines, likelihood of success, and total costs can vary widely by product candidate. There are also risks inherent in the regulatory clearance and\napproval process. At this time, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in our efforts to expand the application of our technological platforms.\nSales and Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses\nOur sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, travel and benefits, including share-based\ncompensation; marketing costs; professional fees, including fees for outside attorneys and accountants; occupancy costs; insurance; and other general and administrative\nexpenses, which include, but are not limited to, corporate licenses, director fees, hiring costs, taxes, postage, office supplies, information technology and meeting costs. Our\nsales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to increase due to costs associated with the continued commercialization of our products and services and the increased\nheadcount necessary to support growth in operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical\naccounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nPercentage\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nProduct revenue $ 5,474 $ 2,410 127 %\nService and other revenue 2,648 3,352 (21) %\nTotal revenue 8,122 5,762 41 %\nCost of revenue 3,275 2,489 32 %\nGross profit 4,847 3,273 48 %\nResearch and development costs 3,315 2,429 36 %\nSales and marketing expenses 3,549 2,841 25 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 3,155 2,900 9 %\nOther income (expense):\nOther expense, net (11) (12) NM\nInterest income, net 209 100 109 %\nNet loss $ (4,974) $ (4,809) 3 %\nNM – The percentage change is not meaningful.\n21\nRevenue. Total revenue was $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an\nincrease of $2.4 million, or 41%.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nPercentage\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nBiologics and drug delivery\nDisposable products $ 2,062 $ 455 353 %\nServices and license fees 2,369 3,032 (22)%\nSubtotal – Biologics and drug delivery revenue 4,431 3,487 27 %\nNeurosurgery navigation and therapy\nDisposable products 2,860 1,874 53 %\nServices — 44 (100)%\nSubtotal – Neurosurgery navigation and therapy 2,860 1,918 49 %\nCapital equipment and software\nSystems and software products 552 81 581 %\nServices 279 276 1 %\nSubtotal – Capital equipment and software revenue 831 357 133 %\nTotal revenue $ 8,122 $ 5,762 41 %\nBiologics and drug delivery revenue, which includes sales of services and disposable products related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products,\nincreased 27% to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $3.5 million for the same period in 2023. Our overall revenue growth is attributable to a\n$1.6 million increase in product revenue resulting from higher demand for disposables as multiple partners progress in their trials, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million\nin service and other revenue due to a reduction in the number of preclinical studies performed, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period\nin 2023.\nNeurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 49%\nto $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is driven by higher product revenue of $1.0 million\nresulting from newly activated accounts, increased case count, and new product offerings, including the SmartFrame OR and Prism Laser Therapy, during the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\nCapital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, increased 133% to $0.8 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, from $0.4 million for the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the placements of ClearPoint navigation capital equipment and software\nand Prism laser units.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue was $3.3 million, resulting in gross profit of $4.8 million and gross margin of 60%, for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, and was $2.5 million, resulting in gross profit of $3.3 million and gross margin of 57% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross margin was\nprimarily due to lower costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the transition to the new manufacturing facility, occurring in 2023, and higher volumes for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024.\nResearch and Development Costs. Research and development costs were $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.4 million for the same\nperiod in 2023, an increase of $0.9 million, or 36%. The increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs and product and software development costs, each in the amount of\n$0.5 million, partially offset by lower trial costs of $0.1 million.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.8 million for the same period in\n2023, an increase of $0.7 million, or 25%. This increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, of $0.6 million resulting from\nincreases in headcount, and increased travel costs of $0.1 million.\n22\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.9 million for the\nsame period in 2023, an increase of $0.3 million, or 9%. This increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs and share-based compensation of $0.4 million, higher\noccupancy costs of $0.2 million, and higher professional fees of $0.1 million, partially offset by lower bad debt expense of $0.5 million mainly as a result of subsequent\nrecoveries.\nInterest Income (Expense). Net interest income was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2023, as a\nresult of increased investment in U.S. Government debt securities stemming from the capital raise in March 2024 as well as lower interest expense due to the early repayment of\nthe First Closing Note.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nPercentage\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nProduct revenue $ 14,053 $ 7,377 90 %\nService and other revenue 9,566 9,768 (2) %\nTotal revenue 23,619 17,145 38 %\nCost of revenue 9,259 7,544 23 %\nGross profit 14,360 9,601 50 %\nResearch and development costs 9,060 9,057 — %\nSales and marketing expenses 10,673 9,248 15 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 8,769 9,036 (3) %\nOther income (expense):\nOther expense, net (32) (25) NM\nInterest income, net 646 295 119 %\nNet loss $ (13,528) $ (17,470) (23) %\nNM – The percentage change is not meaningful.\nRevenue.

Our overall revenue growth is attributable to a\n$2.9 million increase in product revenue resulting from higher demand for disposables as multiple partners progress in their trials, and a $0.6 million increase in service and\nother revenue related to new preclinical trials and service agreements entered into with our Partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\nNeurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 14%\nto $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $6.5 million for the same period in 2023. Product revenue increased 33%, or $1.8 million, resulting from\nnewly activated accounts, increased case count, and new product offerings, including the SmartFrame OR and Prism Laser Therapy, during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This was partially offset by a decrease in service and other revenue of $0.9 million primarily as a result of pausing a\nco-development program with one of our Brain Computer Interface partners.\nCapital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, increased 180% to $3.2 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, from $1.1 million for the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the placements of ClearPoint navigation capital equipment and software\nand Prism laser units.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue was $9.3 million, resulting in gross profit of $14.4 million and gross margin of 61%, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and was $7.5 million, resulting in gross profit of $9.6 million and gross margin of 56% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in\ngross margin was primarily due to lower costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the transition to the new manufacturing facility, occurring in 2023, and\nhigher volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nResearch and Development Costs. Research and development costs were relatively flat at $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Personnel costs,\nincluding share-based compensation, were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by $0.7 million as compared to the same period in 2023. This was offset by\nlower product and software development costs of $0.7 million as a result of reprioritization of certain research and development initiatives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.2 million for the same period\nin 2023, an increase of $1.4 million, or 15%. This increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs, including share-based compensation, of $1.1 million resulting from\nincreases in headcount, and increased travel costs of $0.3 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.0 million for the\nsame period in 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3%. This decrease was due primarily to lower bad debt expense of $1.4 million mainly as a result of subsequent recoveries,\npartially offset by higher personnel costs and share-based compensation of $0.8 million and higher occupancy costs of $0.3 million.\nInterest Income (Expense). Net interest income was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2023, as a\nresult of increased investment in U.S. Government debt securities stemming from the capital raise in March 2024 as well as lower interest expense due to the early repayment of\nthe First Closing Note.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception, which has resulted in a cumulative deficit at September 30, 2024 of $186.0 million. In addition, our use of cash from operations\namounted to $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of notes payable. As discussed in Note 8, in March 2024, we\ncompleted a public offering of 2,653,848 shares of our common stock from which the net proceeds totaled approximately $16.2 million after deducting our payment of\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.\n24\nIn August 2024, we repaid in full the remaining $10 million outstanding under the SPA entered into in 2020, pursuant to which we issued secured convertible notes to two\ninvestors raising gross proceeds of $25 million, of which $15 million had been previously converted to common stock. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements included above in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report for additional information with respect to the secured convertible notes.\nAs a result of these transactions and our business operations, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $21.6 million at September 30, 2024. In management’s opinion, based on our\ncurrent forecasts for revenue, expense and cash flows, our existing cash and cash equivalent balances at September 30, 2024, are sufficient to support our operations and meet\nour obligations for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nCash activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash used in operating activities $ (7,707) $ (12,551)\nCash (used in) provided by investing activities (12) 9,137\nCash provided by financing activities 6,152 141\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,567) $ (3,273)\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $7.7 million, a decrease of $4.8\nmillion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a lower net loss of $3.9 million, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $1.1\nmillion, partially offset by a net decrease in non-cash items of $0.2 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to higher accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities, partially offset by lower deferred revenue. The change in the non-cash items results primarily from recoveries in the allowance for credit losses, partially\noffset by higher share-based compensation expense.\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were nominal and related to equipment\nacquisitions.\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $9.1 million and consisted of proceeds from the maturities of short-term\ninvestments, partially offset primarily by equipment acquisitions related to our new manufacturing site in Carlsbad, California.\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of proceeds, net of offering\ncosts, of $16.2 million received from the public offering of our common stock and $0.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock\npurchase plan. This is partially offset by the repayment of the 2020 secured convertible note of $10.0 million and payments of $0.3 million for taxes related to shares withheld\nin connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee\nstock purchase plan, partially offset by payments for taxes related to shares withheld in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nTo date, we have not achieved profitability. We could continue to incur net losses as we continue our efforts to expand the commercialization of our products and services and\npursue additional applications for our technology platforms. Our cash balances are primarily held in a variety of demand accounts with a view to liquidity and capital\npreservation.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of medical devices, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of\ncapital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to\n25\nsuccessfully commercialize our products and pursue additional applications for our technology platforms. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n• the ability of our Partners to achieve commercial success, including their use of our products and services in their preclinical studies, clinical trials and delivery of\ntherapies;\n• the ultimate duration and impact of macroeconomic trends, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including military\nconflicts), and legislative and political developments;\n• the ability to maintain our existing relationships with our Partners and to enter into new relationships;\n• the timing of broader market acceptance and adoption of our products;\n• the scope, rate of progress and cost of our ongoing product development activities relating to our products;\n• the cost and timing of expanding our sales, clinical support, marketing and distribution capabilities, and other corporate infrastructure;\n• the cost and timing of establishing inventories at levels sufficient to support our sales;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n• the cost of pursuing additional applications of our technology platforms under current collaborative arrangements, and the terms and timing of any future collaborative,\nlicensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n• the cost and timing of any clinical trials;\n• the cost and timing of regulatory filings, clearances and approvals; and\n• the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\n26\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk is limited primarily to interest income and expense sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.\nOur investments are in short-term bank deposits, short-term U.S. Government debt securities, and institutional money market funds. The primary objective of our investment\nactivities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. In the event we invest in short-term\ninvestments, due to the nature of our short-term investments and the Company's intent to hold such debt securities to maturity, we believe that we are not subject to any material\nmarket risk exposure.\nForeign Currency Risk\nTo date, we have not recorded a significant amount of sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and have only limited business transactions in foreign currencies. We do not\ncurrently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce our foreign currency risks, which at present, are not material. We do not believe we have material exposure to risk\nfrom changes in foreign currency exchange rates at this time. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our internal processes relating to foreign currency exchange, including\nthe potential use of hedging strategies.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our\ndisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\nby others within our organization. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,\nwe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us\nin the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nfile or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n27\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe are involved from time-to-time with various legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and legal proceedings are of a nature we believe are\nnormal and incidental to a medical device company, and may include product liability, intellectual property, employment matters, and other general claims.\nWe make provisions for liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such provisions are assessed at\nleast quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of any settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events\npertaining to a particular case. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claim that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse\neffect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\nNone.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNone.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.\nNot applicable.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company, incorporated in 1998 as a Delaware corporation, that develops and commercializes innovative platforms for\nperforming minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain. From our inception in 1998, we have deployed significant resources to fund our efforts to develop the\nfoundational capabilities for enabling magnetic resonance imaging (\"MRI\") guided interventions, building an intellectual property portfolio, and identifying and building out\ncommercial applications for the technologies we develop. In 2021, our efforts expanded beyond the MRI suite to encompass development and commercialization of\nneurosurgical device products for the operating room setting, as well as consulting services for pharmaceutical companies. Our products have been installed or used at over 75\ncenters globally.\nSince 2020, we have evolved to become a company comprised of two parts: (i) a business providing medical devices for neurosurgical applications, and (ii) a business\nfocused on partnerships in the biologics and drug delivery space.\nMedical Devices for Neurosurgical Application\nThe first foundational part of our business is focused on providing medical devices for neurosurgical applications.\nOur primary medical device product, the ClearPoint system, is an integrated system comprised of hardware components, disposable components, and intuitive, menu-\ndriven software. The primary applications for the ClearPoint system are to target and guide: (a) the insertion of deep brain stimulation electrodes, biopsy needles, and laser\ncatheters; and (b) the infusion of pharmaceuticals into the brain. The ClearPoint system was originally designed for use in an MRI setting. In 2021, we launched the SmartFrame\nArray Neuro Navigation System and Software, which allows for operating room placement of the ClearPoint system and completion of the procedure in the MRI suite. In 2024,\nwe commenced limited market release of the SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System, which allows for complete procedures to be performed in the operating room.\nIn 2022, we commenced commercialization of the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, a laser ablation system. The ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy\nSystem was developed and is manufactured for us by CLS. We have exclusive global rights to commercialize the system for neuro applications.\nBiologics and Drug Delivery\nThe second part of our business is focused on partnerships in the biologics and drug delivery space, supporting our customers from the earliest stages of their research\nthrough their clinical study and commercialization process. Since 2021, a growing part of the revenue from our business is derived from preclinical development services, which\ninclude protocol consultation and solutions for preclinical study design and execution. Our consulting services include a core competency of in vivo biology services in large\nand small research models to assist our customers with establishing drug safety prior to and in support of their human clinical trials.\nCurrently, we have more than 50 pharma/biotech, academic, and contract research organization partners who are evaluating or using our products and services in trials\nto inject gene and cell therapies directly into the brain. These\n3\nTable of Contents\npartnerships involve drug development programs that are at various stages of development ranging from preclinical research to late-stage regulatory trials for over 15 distinct\ndisease states. This part of our business potentially represents the largest opportunity for growth, which we estimate could have an approximately $7 billion market potential;\nhowever, our ability to grow in this market is dependent on our ability to maintain and establish new relationships with pharmaceutical company customers, such customers'\ncontinuation of research and product development plans, and such customers achieving success in completion of clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approvals of their\ndrugs and biologics.\nOur Products and Services\nThe ClearPoint System\nOur ClearPoint system is an integrated system comprised of hardware components, disposable components and intuitive, menu-driven software.\nClearPoint Hardware. Our hardware components consist primarily of a head fixation frame, computer workstation and in-room monitor. The head fixation frame\nimmobilizes the patient’s head during the procedure, and it is designed to optimize the placement of an imaging head coil in proximity to the patient’s head. When performed in\nthe MRI suite, the ClearPoint system software is installed on a computer workstation networked with an MRI scanner, for which we use a commercially available laptop\ncomputer. The in-room monitor allows the physician to view the display of our ClearPoint system workstation from the scanner room while performing the procedure.\nClearPoint Disposables. The disposable components of our ClearPoint system consist primarily of our SmartFrame trajectory device, a hand controller and related\naccessories, and our SmartFlow Cannula. Our SmartFrame device is an adjustable trajectory guide that attaches to the patient’s skull and holds the targeting cannula. The hand\ncontroller attaches to our SmartFrame device, and it is used by the physician to adjust the roll, pitch, and X and Y orientation of the targeting cannula while the patient is in the\nMRI scanner. The accessories include all other components necessary to facilitate the MRI-guided neurosurgical procedure, such as our SmartGrid patch, which is an MRI-\nvisible marking grid that enables rapid localization of the entry position into the brain, and our customized surgical draping, which creates a sterile field within the MRI scanner.\nThe SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System is a single use disposable that does not require MRI guidance. For drug delivery procedures, our SmartFlow cannula, which is an\nMRI-compatible injection and aspiration cannula, serves as the vehicle for the delivery of the compound.\nClearPoint Software. Our ClearPoint system software guides the physician in surgical planning, device alignment, navigation to the target and procedure monitoring.\nThe software uses image segmentation algorithms to help locate and identify our SmartFrame device and its targeting cannula, as well as the anatomical structures of the brain.\nThe software also performs geometric computations to provide the physician with information regarding the positioning of instruments inserted into the patient’s brain relative\nto the target anatomical structures. At the completion of the procedure, the software generates an automated report that includes the key metrics from the procedure. In 2022, we\nreceived FDA approval for the ClearPoint Maestro Brain Model, a software tool which we designed to automate the process of identifying, labelling, and quantifying the volume\nand shape of brain structures visible in MRI images.\nClearPoint Therapeutic Solutions\nOur ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System is indicated for use to necrotize or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy for neuro\napplications under 3.0T MRI guidance. The laser system can be used in conjunction with the ClearPoint navigation platform to refine the desired trajectory for the laser therapy\ncatheter and to confirm accurate laser catheter placement. The laser system consists of a mobile laser unit, Thermoguide software to monitor changes in tissue temperature\nduring therapy, and disposable laser applicator and magnetic resonance (\"MR\") introducer components.\nClearPoint Services\nWe provide consulting services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology partners for improving outcome predictability and optimizing preclinical and\nclinical workflows. Our expertise is concentrated in benchtop testing, preclinical studies, clinical trial support, regulatory consultation, and over-arching translation from the\npreclinical to the clinical setting to enhance accuracy and precision of drug delivery. In 2021, we expanded our expertise to include in vivo biology services in large and small\nresearch models to assist our customers with establishing drug safety prior to and in support of human clinical trials.\n4\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Status\nOur ClearPoint system 510(k) clearance from the FDA permits us to market and promote our ClearPoint system in the U.S. for use in general neurosurgical procedures,\nwhich includes procedures such as biopsies, laser catheter insertions, and deep brain stimulation lead and electrode insertions. This is the same general indication for use that\napplies to other devices that have traditionally been used in the performance of stereotactic neurosurgical procedures. In the EU, UK, Israel, and Brazil our approval carries a\nsimilar indication for use.\nOur SmartFlow cannula has received 510(k) clearance for injection of Cytarabine or for removal of cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles. It has also received CE\nmark for the injection of approved fluids into the brain. Delivery of other therapeutic agents using our SmartFlow cannula is investigational. The SmartFlow cannula is a\ndisposable device intended for single patient use only and is not intended for implant.\nOur development partner CLS received 510(k) clearance for its laser system to necrotize or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy in\nneuro applications under 3.0T MRI guidance. In the U.S., the laser system is commercialized by us as the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System.\nOur SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System received 510(k) clearance in 2024. SmartFrame OR is intended to provide stereotactic guidance for the placement and\noperation of instruments or devices during planning and operation of neurological procedures performed in conjunction with the use of a compatible optical stereotaxic\nnavigation system using preoperative MRI and/or Computed Tomography (\"CT\") imaging. These procedures include biopsies, catheter placement and electrode introduction,\nincluding the placement of deep brain stimulation (\"DBS\") leads. SmartFrame OR is a disposable device intended for single patient use only.\nMarket Discussion\nMedical Devices for Neurosurgical Application\nWe believe there are more than 140,000 potential neurosurgical procedures per year in the U.S. in which our ClearPoint products could be used as a navigational\nplatform for functional stereotactic neurosurgery in indications currently approved by the FDA or as a therapy device for performance of laser interstitial thermal therapy\n(\"LITT\"):\n• Electrode Placement – The current standard of care for the placement of the DBS or responsive neurostimulation (\"RNS\") electrodes in the operating room\nrequires the patient to be awake during surgery in order to verify proper placement. When DBS or RNS is performed in the MRI suite, our ClearPoint system can\nprovide intra-procedural navigation and visualization of the electrode placement and the patient may be placed under general anesthesia for the procedure. Three\nmanufacturers have received FDA clearances for DBS systems: Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories. All three have products that are indicated\nfor Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and drug resistant epilepsy. DBS is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, a degenerative condition that\naffects more than one million people in the U.S. and 10 million people worldwide. DBS works by stimulating a targeted region of the brain through implanted\nleads that are powered by a device called an implantable pulse generator. We estimate 120,000 Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor patients per year are\npotential candidates for the implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes utilizing our ClearPoint system. In addition, patients suffering from drug resistant\nepilepsy, refractory essential tremor, dystonia, severe obsessive compulsion disorder, severe major depressive disorder, paralysis, Huntington’s disease, auditory\nnerve implantation, Alzheimer’s disease and stroke rehabilitation may create additional potential procedure opportunities in the future. The only commercially\navailable RNS system on the market is manufactured by NeuroPace. Their brain-responsive neuromodulation system is currently approved for use in patients with\ndrug resistant epilepsy and refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy.\n• LITT – LITT is a minimally-invasive MRI-guided technique to treat primary and metastatic brain tumors, as well as patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The\ntreatment uses heat to treat and ablate the tumor or regions where seizures begin. In the U.S. approximately 35,000 patients have brain tumors that could benefit\nfrom LITT and up to one million suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy. Historically two manufacturers have FDA cleared laser therapy systems in North America –\nMedtronic’s Visualase system and Monteris Medical’s NeuroBlate system. In September 2022, our development partner CLS received 510(k) clearance for its\nMRI guided laser interstitial thermal therapy system for neuro applications, and we\n5\nTable of Contents\ncommenced commercialization of this laser system, marketed as the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, in the U.S.\n• Brain tumor biopsy – For smaller, harder to reach brain tumors or those near critical structures (the brain stem or large blood vessels), navigating the surgical field\nso that the biopsy needle reaches the brain tumor and accurately acquires a representative sample of the tumor is paramount. For small, deep-seated tumors,\nnavigating a device to the exact target is challenging and necessary to avoid the inadvertent destruction of healthy brain tissue. We estimate brain tumor\napplications represent the potential for approximately 15,000 procedures per year.\nBiologics and Drug Delivery\nThe blood-brain barrier prevents large-molecule, and nearly all small-molecule, neurotherapeutics from reaching the brain. Several pharmaceutical and biotech\ncompanies are developing methods to deliver a wide variety of molecules, genes or proteins to targeted brain tissue or structures that would need to bypass the blood-brain\nbarrier. This may enable the development of treatments for rare single-gene pediatric disorders, such as AADC Deficiency, Friedreich’s Ataxia and Angelman Syndrome, as\nwell as adult disorders including Parkinson’s disease, drug resistant epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and certain types of cancers, such as Glioblastoma. The\npotential addressable market by 2025 for these indications is estimated to be a $7 billion dollar market opportunity of more than 600,000 patients in the U.S. If our ClearPoint\nsystem and SmartFlow cannula are approved for these drug delivery treatments and become the standard approach to local drug delivery in the brain, we believe the impact on\nour financial performance could be significant. However, these treatments are subject to FDA-mandated clinical trial requirements, which are expensive and time consuming for\nour partners to conduct. Nonetheless, several of our biologics and drug delivery customers are pursuing preclinical and clinical trials for which we generate revenue through sale\nof products including our SmartFlow cannula, as well as a growing list of preclinical development services that we began offering in 2021. The first gene therapy submission\nwas approved by regulatory authorities in Europe in 2022.\nSales and Marketing\nMedical Devices for Neurosurgical Application\nCommercializing our ClearPoint products and services for neurosurgery applications, primarily involves marketing and selling directly to:\n• physicians who care for patients suffering from neurological disorders, including stereotactic or functional neurosurgeons, who perform the neurosurgical\nprocedures, and neurologists, who interact with patients prior to and following surgery and who refer patients for surgery; and\n• hospitals involved in the treatment of neurological disorders, including the opinion leaders at these hospitals.\nOur business model for the ClearPoint products includes producing high margin revenue from sales of the disposable components. Given that focus on disposable\nproduct sales, we sell our reusable components at lower margins in order to secure installations within hospitals. In addition, we may install the ClearPoint reusable components\nat a hospital, but retain title, either for an agreed-upon period of time while the hospital evaluates and processes the purchase opportunity, or for a rental fee. Our disposable and\nreusable ClearPoint products are tightly integrated, which allows us to leverage each new installation of a system to generate recurring sales of our disposable products.\nBiologics and Drug Delivery\nCommercializing our ClearPoint products and services for biologics and drug delivery primarily involves marketing and selling directly to pharmaceutical companies\nfocused on research and development of therapies for neurological indications.\nOur business model for our ClearPoint services includes providing preclinical studies, clinical trial support, regulatory consultation, surgical workflow guidance, and\nover-arching translation services to aid in the progression of our pharmaceutical customers’ drug delivery process. The ClearPoint services allow us to generate early technology\nintegration of our products into our customers’ delivery workflow.\n6\nTable of Contents\nManufacturing and Assembly\nOur ClearPoint system and SmartFlow cannula include off-the-shelf components and custom-made components produced to our proprietary specifications by various\nthird parties, and components that, prior to September 2023, we assembled in our Irvine, California facility. In September 2023, we completed the transition from our Irvine,\nCalifornia facility to fully operating in our Carlsbad, California facility. We use third parties to manufacture certain components to utilize their individual expertise, minimize\nour capital investment and help control costs. We purchase most custom-made components of our ClearPoint system from single-source suppliers due to quality considerations,\nlower costs and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements; however, we have identified alternative sources for certain components, and believe additional alternative\nsources are available, if needed, for other components. Generally, we purchase our components through purchase orders and do not have long-term contracts with most of our\nsuppliers.\nOur ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System is manufactured exclusively by CLS.\nOur facilities are structured to complete component processing, final assembly, packaging and distribution activities for our products. The assembly process is\nperformed in a controlled environment as required by applicable regulation for medical device assembly. Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA’s\nQuality System Regulation (\"QSR\"), which requires that manufacturers have a quality management system for the design and production of medical devices. To the extent we\nconduct such operations outside the U.S., we would be subject to international regulatory requirements.\nOur facilities are FDA-registered, and we believe they are compliant with the FDA’s QSR. We are also certified to ISO 13485 and the Medical Device Single Audit\nProgram (\"MDSAP\"). We have instituted a quality management system, under which we have established policies and procedures that control and direct our operations with\nrespect to design, procurement, manufacture, inspection, testing, installation, data analysis, training and marketing. We review and internally audit our compliance with these\npolicies and procedures, which provides a means for continued evaluation and improvement. As required by our quality management system, we undertake an assessment and\nqualification process for each third-party manufacturer or supplier that we use. Typically, our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are certified to ISO 9001 and/or 13485.\nWe also periodically perform audit procedures on our key third-party manufacturers and suppliers to monitor their activities for compliance with our quality management\nsystem. Our facilities, and the facilities of the third-party manufacturers and suppliers we use, are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities, including the FDA\nand other governmental agencies.\nCustomers\nMedical Devices for Neurosurgical Application\nA small number of our hospital customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of ClearPoint products. Our five largest hospital customers\naccounted for approximately 27% of our functional neurosurgery navigation disposable product revenues in 2023.\nBiologics and Drug Delivery\nAt March 5, 2024, we had commercial relationships with over 50 pharma/biotech, academic, and contract research organization partners who have either evaluated or\nused our SmartFlow cannula or our consulting services.\nOne of these companies, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. and its affiliates (\"PTC\"), a related party who is a significant stockholder with a Board representative, accounted for\napproximately 21% of our biologics and drug delivery revenues in 2023. On May 7, 2019, we entered into a supply agreement with PTC (the “PTC Supply Agreement”)\npursuant to which we supply certain products and engage in performance of certain services under the terms of mutually agreed upon Statements of Work. Certain products\nsupplied under the PTC Supply Agreement are subject to limited favored pricing terms for such products intended for human use in clinical or commercial settings.\nOn November 20, 2020, we entered into an Addendum to the PTC Supply Agreement pursuant to which PTC agreed to purchase products in exchange for a minimum\nquarterly payment in consideration for our commitment to supply such products and provide services consisting of training, preclinical and clinical case support and regulatory\nsupport. In January 2023, the Addendum to Supply Agreement was further amended and restated to allow for the Company to provide regulatory support to PTC in additional\nagreed geographies.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe also entered into a Second Source Manufacturing Agreement in connection with the PTC Supply Agreement (the “Second Source Manufacturing Agreement”).\nUnder the Second Source Manufacturing Agreement, PTC may, at its expense, request that we appoint a backup contract manufacturer to supply products in the event of a\nsupply interruption or a bankruptcy event. The exercise by PTC of its second source manufacturing rights may be subject, in certain cases, to payment by PTC to us of a per-\nproduct royalty payment. The Second Source Manufacturing Agreement shall continue for the term of the PTC Supply Agreement, subject to certain early termination rights.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on\na combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property.\nOur patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications that we own or that we license from others. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for\nour products and technologies where and when we believe it is appropriate. U.S. patents are granted generally for a term of 20 years from the earliest effective priority date of\nthe patent application. The actual protection afforded by a foreign patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its claims and the\navailability of legal remedies in the country.\nWe also rely on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary\naspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting\nrelationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement\nwhich relate to our business.\nPatents\nWe have a significant patent portfolio in the field of neurosurgical and MRI-guided interventions. As of March 5, 2024, we own or license over 100 issued patents. Our\nowned and issued patents expire at various dates beginning in 2023. Some of our patents and patent applications are subject to licensing and cross-licensing arrangements in\nplace with third parties.\nTrademarks\nWe have over 25 registered trademarks in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China.\nCertain License and Royalty Arrangements\nPhilips\nDuring 2020, we entered into a worldwide license and research agreement with Philips, under which Philips has licensed to us the use of the technology underlying its\nPhilips Brain Model in our ClearPoint Maestro Brain Model (“Maestro”), the first generation of which received 510(k) clearance in 2022. We believe that Maestro will have use\nacross all our product lines through automatic pathway and trajectory planning and confirmation of device placement, while identifying eloquent structures of the brain so as to\navoid crucial anatomy. In consideration for the license, we paid a fee upon execution of the agreement and are committed to pay royalties based on (a) sales of systems, and (b)\nprocedures in which the licensed technology is used. In early 2022, we expanded our collaboration with Philips to include additional technology to allow use of the Philips\nBrain Model with CT imaging. In early 2023, we further expanded our collaboration with Philips further to include additional technology regarding subnuclei segmentation to\nthe Maestro MRI and CT functionality.\nUCB\nIn March 2023, we entered into a multi-year license agreement with UCB to partner on drug delivery platforms for UCB's gene therapy portfolio. Under the terms of\nthe license agreement, UCB will utilize our technology and services in connection with the development and commercialization of UCB's gene therapy products. Certain fees\nunder the agreement will be paid to us as success-based milestones.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCLS\nIn October 2018, and as amended in August 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and a distribution agreement with CLS that provides us the\nexclusive global rights to commercialize and sell CLS’s portfolio of products and to collaborate with CLS on the development and commercialization of new products in the\nneurosurgical field. Pursuant to these agreements, we began commercialization of the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System in the U.S. in 2022.\nUCSF\nIn 2013, we entered into a license agreement with UCSF that provides for our use of design features developed by UCSF, which we incorporated into our SmartFlow\ncannula, and for which we are committed to pay royalties based on our sales of the SmartFlow cannula.\nIn 2023, we entered into a license agreement with UCSF to use technology developed by UCSF to develop and commercialize a radially branching cellular delivery\ndevice, for which we are committed to pay royalties based on the sales of any future commercialized device.\nNE Scientific\nIn 2022, we entered into a development and license agreement with NE Scientific to incorporate NE Scientific’s GPU-accelerated software solution for modeling of\ntherapies administered to the brain into our products. In consideration of the foregoing, we paid fees for development of the software solution, and are committed to pay\nroyalties based on (a) per hospital activations of the software solution, and (b) offline applications in which the licensed technology is used.\nSoftware License Arrangements\nIn connection with the development of our software products, which includes ClearPoint Software, ClearPoint Array Software, and ClearPoint Maestro Brain Model\nSoftware, we entered into several agreements with third party software providers under which we receive worldwide, non-exclusive licenses to software code related to certain\nfunctional elements of these software products, and for which we are committed to pay royalties for each copy of software product sold, or in certain cases, loaned by us to end-\nusers.\nCompetition\nMedical Devices for Neurosurgical Application\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities\nof other participants. Therefore, our currently marketed products are, and future products we commercialize will be, subject to competition.\nCurrently, we are aware of two companies, Monteris Medical, Inc. and Medtronic, which offer devices for laser ablation under direct MRI guidance. In addition,\ncompanies such as Brainlab, Medtronic, Elekta, FHC Inc., Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and Neurologica Corporation, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co.,\noffer devices and systems for use in conventional stereotactic neurosurgical procedures, such as surgical navigation workstations, frame-based and frameless stereotactic\nsystems, portable computer tomography scanners and computer-controlled guidance systems. These devices and systems are competitive with our ClearPoint system. Also,\nZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.’s ROSA® robot is an operating room alternative to the ClearPoint system. Additionally, we could also face competition from other medical\ndevice, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have the technology, experience and capital resources to develop alternative therapy methods, including MRI-guided\ntechnologies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and technical resources than we have.\nBiologics and Drug Delivery\nDrug delivery can be divided into two categories, those that use image-guidance and those that do not. Our main area of focus and expertise is on image-guided drug\ndelivery, in particular as it relates to the use of MRI technology. Other companies, such as Brainlab and Renishaw plc, also offer systems such as navigational platforms and\ncannulas useful for drug delivery under MRI. These offerings are competitive with ClearPoint’s products. These companies have substantially\n9\nTable of Contents\ngreater marketing, manufacturing, technical, and financial resources than we have. Our preclinical development services business encounters a broad range of competitors of\ndifferent sizes and capabilities, such as clinical research organizations or government funded not-for profit entities and industry experts.\nRegulatory Requirements of the United States Food and Drug Administration\nOur research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other\ncountries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the U.S. are subject to regulation as medical devices under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"), as\nimplemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that the medical devices we\nmanufacture, promote and distribute domestically or export internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:\n• product design, preclinical and clinical development and manufacture;\n• product premarket clearance and approval;\n• product safety, testing, labeling and storage;\n• record-keeping procedures;\n• product marketing, sales and distribution; and\n• post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of\nproducts.\nFDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance,\nauthorization through the de novo classification process, or approval of a premarket approval application (\"PMA\") from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one\nof three classes. Class I devices, considered to have the lowest risk, are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory\ncontrols for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s QSR, facility registration and product listing, medical device reporting (which\nrequire that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or\ncontribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), reports of corrections and removals (which require manufacturers to report recalls or removals and field corrections to\nthe FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA) and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling (\"General\nControls\"). Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of\nthe device (\"Special Controls\"). Manufacturers of most Class II and some Class I devices are required to submit to the FDA and obtain clearance for a premarket notification\nunder Section 510(k) of the FDCA prior to commercially distributing the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the\ngreatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices that are not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in\nClass III, requiring approval of a PMA unless they can be reclassified into Class I or II via the de novo classification process.\n510(k) Clearance Pathway\nWhen a 510(k) clearance is required, we will be required to submit a 510(k) premarket notification demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent\nto a legally marketed device, referred to as the “predicate device.” A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a Class III device that was in commercial\ndistribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications, or a product previously placed in Class II or Class I through the de novo\nclassification process. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological\ncharacteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.\nThe FDA has a user fee goal to apply no more than 90 calendar review days to 510(k) submissions. During the process, the FDA may issue an Additional Information\nrequest, which stops the clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 270 days or more.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, or any change that could significantly affect the safety or\neffectiveness of the device, requires a new 510(k) clearance and may\n10\nTable of Contents\neven, in some circumstances, require a de novo authorization or PMA, if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues or the product has a new intended use. The FDA\nrequires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s\ndecision. If the FDA were to disagree with any of our determinations that changes to a device did not require a new 510(k) submission, it could require us to cease marketing\nand distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or PMA approval is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance,\nde novo authorization, or PMA approval for any modifications to a device, we may be required to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device, if already in distribution,\nuntil 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or PMA approval is obtained and we could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nDe Novo Classification\nDevices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To\navoid requiring PMA review of novel low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted a provision that allows the FDA to classify a\nnovel low- to moderate-risk device into Class I or II in the absence of a predicate device that would support 510(k) clearance. The FDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of\ndevices submitted for review under the de novo pathway and devices determined to be Class II through this pathway can serve as predicate devices for future 510(k) applicants.\nThe de novo pathway can require clinical data.\nThe FDA has a user fee goal to review a de novo request in 150 calendar review days. During the process, the FDA may issue an Additional Information request,\nwhich stops the clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be as long as 330 days or more.\nPMA Approval Pathway\nA PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process or classified through the de novo process or is not otherwise exempt\nfrom the FDA’s premarket clearance and approval requirements. A PMA must generally be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical,\nclinical trial, manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. During the review period, the\nFDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be\nconvened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s\nrecommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of our or our third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities\nto ensure compliance with the QSR. Once a PMA is approved, the FDA may require that certain conditions of approval be met, such as conducting a post market clinical trial.\nThe FDA has a user fee goal to review a PMA in 180 calendar review days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 320 review days if the\nsubmission does require advisory committee input. During the process, the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter, which stops the review clock. The applicant has up to 180\ndays to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 360 days or more, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 500 days or more if the\nsubmission does require advisory committee input.\nIf the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally\nsought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including,\namong other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement\naction, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval and/or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.\nNew PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of\nmodifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a\nPMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical\ndata or the convening of an advisory panel. We could seek to add new indications for use of our existing products that require the approval of a PMA, although we do not have\nany current plans to do so.\n11\nTable of Contents\nClinical Trials\nClinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and also may be required for 510(k) clearance andd e novo authorization. Such trials generally\nrequire an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which is approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the\nproduct is exempt from the IDE requirements or deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. A significant risk device is one that\npresents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in\ndiagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject.\nAn IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the\ntesting protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. During\nthe study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain\npatient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping\nrequirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application\nfor compliance with IDE requirements.\nClinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard intended\nto protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the\ntrial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial\nsites and are designed to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device when\nconsidering whether a device satisfies the statutory standard for commercialization.\nClinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board, or IRB, for the relevant clinical trial sites. We, the FDA, or the IRB could\nsuspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results\nof clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance, authorization or\napproval to market the product in the U.S. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high-\nrisk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country.\nAlthough the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must\nmanufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose\nwith respect to manufacturing.\nPervasive and Continuing Regulation\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. In addition to the requirements below, the Medical Device Reporting\nregulations require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product\nmalfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Additional regulatory requirements include:\n• product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;\n• QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance\nprocedures during all aspects of the design, manufacturing, and distribution process;\n• labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;\n• clearance, authorization, or approval of product modifications;\n• post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;\n12\nTable of Contents\n• post-market surveillance regulations, which apply, when necessary, to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the\ndevice;\n• the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of\ngoverning laws and regulations;\n• regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and\n• notices of corrections or removals.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDA’s QSR and other\nregulations. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with the QSR\nand other regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with QSR and other regulations.\nAdvertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the United States Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"),\nand by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement actions\nbrought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. Furthermore, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can\ninitiate litigation relating to advertising claims. In addition, we are required to meet regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S., which can change rapidly with\nrelatively short notice. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we\nmodify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities\nmight take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under\nother statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nFailure by us or by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other\nregulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to:\n• untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n• customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our marketed products;\n• operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n• refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;\n• rescinding 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n• refusal to grant export approval for our marketed products; or\n• criminal prosecution.\nInternational Marketing Approvals\nInternational sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain\napproval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ.\nThe EU has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices.\nEach EU member state has implemented legislation applying these directives and standards at a national level. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted\nlaws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of the laws of the relevant member state applying\nthe applicable EU directive are entitled to bear a CE mark and, accordingly, can be distributed throughout the member states of the EU as well as in other countries, such as\nSwitzerland and Israel, that have mutual recognition agreements with the EU or have adopted the EU’s regulatory standards.\nThe method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the classification of the medical device, which may be Class I, Class\nIIa, Class IIb or Class III. Normally, the method involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device, and a third-party\nassessment by a Notified Body, usually of the design of the device and of the manufacturer’s quality system. A Notified Body is a private commercial entity that is designated\nby the national government of a member state as being competent to make independent judgments about whether a device complies with applicable regulatory requirements. An\nassessment by a Notified Body in one country with the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the device\n13\nTable of Contents\nthroughout the EU. In addition, compliance with ISO 13485 issued by the International Organization for Standardization, among other standards, establishes the presumption of\nconformity with the essential requirements for CE marking. Certification to the ISO 13485 standard demonstrates the presence of a quality management system that can be used\nby a manufacturer for design and development, production, installation and servicing of medical devices and the design, development and provision of related services.\nOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the previous EU medical\ndevices directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, without the need\nfor adoption of EU member state laws implementing them, in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among\nEU member states. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework\nacross the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.\nThe Medical Devices Regulation went into effect as of May 26, 2021, which:\n• Strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n• Establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n• Improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n• Set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n• Strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nHealthcare Laws and Regulations\nThird-Party Reimbursement\nIn the U.S. and elsewhere, healthcare providers that perform surgical procedures using medical devices such as ours generally rely on third-party payors, including\ngovernmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payors, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products. Consequently, sales of medical devices are\ndependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the customer from third-party payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon\nthe type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. In general, third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for medically\nreasonable and necessary procedures and tests that utilize medical devices. Third-party payors may provide separate payments for implanted or disposable devices themselves,\nalthough no such separate payments are currently provided for our ClearPoint disposable products. Most third-party payors will not pay separately for capital equipment.\nInstead, payment for the cost of using the capital equipment is considered to be covered as part of payments received for performing the procedure. In determining payment\nrates, third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing the prices charged for medical products and services in comparison to other therapies.\nIn many foreign markets, including the countries in the EU, pricing of medical devices is subject to government reimbursement. In the U.S., there have been, and we\nexpect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical\ndevices are used.\nMedicare and Medicaid\nThe Medicare program is a federal health benefit program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, that covers and pays for certain\nmedical care items and services for eligible elderly and certain disabled individuals, and individuals with end stage renal disease. The Medicaid program is a federal-state\npartnership under which states receive matching federal payments to fund healthcare services for the poor. Because some private commercial health insurers and some state\nMedicaid programs may follow the coverage and payment policies for Medicare, Medicare’s coverage and payment policies are significant to our business.\n14\nTable of Contents\nMedicare coverage for the procedures in which our ClearPoint products are used currently exists in the hospital inpatient setting, which falls under Part A of the\nMedicare program. Under Medicare Part A, Medicare reimburses acute care hospitals a prospectively determined payment amount for beneficiaries receiving covered inpatient\nservices in an acute care hospital. This method of payment is known as the prospective payment system, or PPS. Under PPS, the prospective payment for a patient’s stay in an\nacute care hospital is determined by the patient’s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the inpatient stay using a classification system known as\nMedicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups, or MS-DRGs. Payments also are adjusted to reflect other factors, such as regional variations in labor costs and indirect medical\neducation expenses. Medicare pays a fixed amount to the hospital based on the MS-DRG into which the patient’s stay is classified, regardless of the actual cost to the hospital of\nfurnishing the procedures, items and services that the patient’s condition requires. Accordingly, acute care hospitals generally do not receive direct Medicare reimbursement\nunder PPS for the specific costs incurred in purchasing medical devices. Rather, reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the MS-DRG-based payments\nmade to hospitals for the services furnished to Medicare-eligible inpatients in which the devices are utilized. For cases involving unusually high costs, a hospital may receive\nadditional “outlier” payments above the pre-determined amount. In addition, there is a mechanism by which new technology services can apply to Medicare for additional\npayments above the pre-determined amount, although such requests have not been granted frequently.\nBecause PPS payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital’s actual costs in furnishing care, and due to payment reforms enacted\nrelatively recently, acute care hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing products, devices and supplies that will reduce the length of inpatient\nstays, decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs. For each MS-DRG, a relative weight is calculated representing the average resources required to care for cases grouped in\nthat particular MS-DRG relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG relative weights are recalculated every year to reflect changes in\ntechnology and medical practice in a budget neutral manner. Under the MS-DRG payment system, there can be significant delays in obtaining adequate reimbursement amounts\nfor hospitals for new technologies such that reimbursement may be insufficient to permit broad acceptance by hospitals.\nIn addition to payments to hospitals for procedures using our technology, Medicare makes separate payments to physicians for their professional services. The\nAmerican Medical Association, or AMA, has developed a coding system known as the Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which has been adopted by the\nMedicare program to describe and develop payment amounts for certain physician services.\nThe Medicare physician fee schedule uses CPT codes (and other codes) as part of the determination of allowable payment amounts to physicians. In determining\nappropriate payment amounts for surgeons, CMS receives guidance from the AMA regarding the relative technical skill level, level of resources used, and complexity of a new\nsurgical procedure. Generally, the designation of a new procedure code for a new procedure using a new product does not occur until after FDA clearance or approval of the\nproduct used in the procedure. Codes are assigned by either the AMA (for CPT codes) or CMS (for Medicare-specific codes), and new codes usually become effective on\nJanuary 1st of each year.\nOne result of the current Medicare payment system, which is also utilized by most non-governmental third-party payors, is that a patient’s treating physician orders a\nparticular service and the hospital (or other facility in which the procedure is performed) bears the cost of delivery of the service. Hospitals have limited ability to align their\nfinancial interests with that of the treating physician because Medicare law generally prohibits hospitals from paying physicians to assist in controlling the costs of hospital\nservices, including paying physicians to limit or reduce services to Medicare beneficiaries even if such services are medically unnecessary. As a result, hospitals have\ntraditionally stocked supplies and products requested by physicians and have had limited ability to restrict physicians’ choice of products and services.\nSince the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the\n\"Affordable Care Act\"), there have been a number of legal challenges as well as other legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could limit the acceptance\nand availability of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results and business. The full effects of the Affordable Care Act may be unknown until all\noutstanding legal issues are resolved, the statutory provisions are fully implemented, and CMS, the FDA, and other federal and state agencies issue final applicable regulations\nor guidance. These developments could result in increased coordination between hospitals and physicians and alignment of financial incentives between hospitals and physicians\nto control hospital costs. Such payment reform efforts and increased coordination among hospitals and physicians may lead to voluntary reductions in the array of choices\ncurrently available to physicians with respect to diagnostic services, medical supplies and equipment, which could result in hospitals reducing the overall number\n15\nTable of Contents\nof vendors from which they purchase supplies, equipment and products. The Affordable Care Act remains subject to potential legal and constitutional challenges in the United\nStates Supreme Court.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, or the Medicare Access Act, removed the sustainable growth rate or SGR, methodology applicable to fees for\nphysician services. The Medicare Access Act also replaced the previous fee-for-service payment system with a more value-based system. As a result, reimbursements from the\nMedicare program may be reduced. As noted above, failure by hospitals and physicians to receive an amount that they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in\nwhich our products are used may deter them from purchasing or using our products and will limit our sales growth.\nCommercial Insurers\nIn addition to the Medicare program, many private payors look to CMS policies as a guideline in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts. The current\ncoverage policies of these private payors may differ from the Medicare program, and the payment rates they make may be higher, lower, or the same as the Medicare program.\nIf CMS or other agencies decrease or limit reimbursement payments for hospitals and physicians, this may affect coverage and reimbursement determinations by many private\npayors. Additionally, some private payors do not follow the Medicare guidelines, and those payors may reimburse only a portion of the costs associated with the use of our\nproducts, or none at all.\nFraud and Abuse Laws\nBecause of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce a number of laws whose\npurpose is to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws.\nAnti-Kickback Laws\nIn the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the\nreferral of patients or other health-related business. The U.S. federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute makes it unlawful for individuals or entities to knowingly and\nwillfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for\nor recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering, any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program\nsuch as Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute covers “any remuneration,” which has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example\ngifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted\nthe statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the\narrangement can be found to violate the statute. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from\nMedicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, several courts have permitted kickback cases brought under the federal False Claims Act to proceed, as\ndiscussed in more detail below.\nBecause the Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly written and encompasses many harmless or efficient arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General\nof the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"OIG\"), to issue a series of regulations, known as “safe harbors.” For example, there are regulatory safe harbors\nfor payments to bona fide employees, properly reported discounts, and payments for certain investment interests. Although an arrangement that fits into one or more of these\nexceptions or safe harbors is immune from prosecution, arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the statute. The\nfailure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more of the exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be\npursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that arguably implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute but do not fully satisfy all the elements of an exception or safe harbor\nmay be subject to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. The Affordable Care Act increased the investigatory authority of the OIG,\nclarified that Anti-Kickback Statute claims can be brought under the federal civil False Claims Act, and provided for enhanced civil monetary penalties and expanded\npermissible exclusion authority.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMany states have laws that implicate anti-kickback restrictions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply regardless of\nwhether federal healthcare program business is involved, such as for self-pay or private pay patients.\nGovernment officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases\nagainst companies, and certain sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure\ntheir business.\nFederal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws\nThe federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a\nfalse or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act\nallow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in\nany monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. Medical device companies,\nlike us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government where they are deemed to have caused submission of false claims by,\namong other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that\nfile claims.\nThe False Claims Act also has been used to assert liability on the basis of misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered and in connection with alleged off-\nlabel promotion of products. Our activities relating to the manner in which we sell our products and document our prices such as the reporting of discount and rebate information\nand other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, may be subject to scrutiny under these\nlaws.\nThe Affordable Care Act may increase the number of cases asserting civil False Claims Act violations since it removes a significant defense to such claims and\nclarifies that a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the retention of a federal healthcare program overpayment are both actionable under the civil False Claims Act.\nWhen an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus\ncivil penalties for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. A number of states have enacted false claim laws analogous\nto the federal civil False Claims Act and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any state or private third-party payor.\nHIPAA Fraud and Other Regulations\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") created a class of federal crimes known as the “federal healthcare offenses,” including\nhealthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or\nattempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or to obtain by means of false of fraudulent pretenses, any money under the control of any\nhealthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored\nprograms. The Affordable Care Act also provides for civil monetary penalties for knowingly participating in certain federal healthcare offenses and enhances sentences under\nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines for such offenses. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or\ncovering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare\nbenefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Entities that are found to have aided or abetted in a violation of the\nHIPAA federal healthcare offenses are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal.\nWe are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions that generally prohibit\ncompanies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the\npredominance of government sponsored healthcare systems around the world, we expect that many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. will be with governmental\nentities and therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws.\n17\nTable of Contents\nHIPAA and Other Privacy & Security Laws\nAs a part of HIPAA, Congress enacted the Administrative Simplification provisions, which are designed to require the establishment of uniform standards governing\nthe conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by\nhealthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as “covered entities.” Several regulations have been promulgated under HIPAA,\nincluding: the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or the Privacy Rule, which restricts the use and disclosure of certain individually\nidentifiable health information; the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establishes standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan\neligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures; and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, or the Security\nRule, which requires covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information. Although we do not believe we are\na covered entity and therefore are not currently subject to these standards directly, we expect that our customers generally will be covered entities and may ask us to\ncontractually comply with certain aspects of these standards by entering into confidentiality agreement or, when appropriate, business associate agreements. While the\ngovernment intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the healthcare industry, our compliance with certain provisions of these standards could\nentail significant costs for us.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\"HITECH\"), was enacted to strengthen and expand the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules\nand the restrictions on use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information. HITECH also fundamentally changed a business associate’s obligations by imposing a\nnumber of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities.\nHITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging patient identifiable health information for remuneration (directly or indirectly), restrictions on marketing to\nindividuals and obligations to agree to provide individuals an accounting of virtually all disclosures of their health information. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to\nreport any unauthorized use or disclosure of patient identifiable health information that compromises the security or privacy of the information, known as a breach, to the\naffected individuals, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), and depending on the size of any such breach, the media for the affected market.\nBusiness associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach.\nHITECH has increased civil penalty amounts for violations of HIPAA by either covered entities or business associates up to an annual maximum of $1.5 million for\neach uncorrected violation based on willful neglect. HITECH requires HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and to investigate any violation that involves\nwillful neglect. Additionally, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA Privacy and\nSecurity Rules that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nIn addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent\nthan those issued under HIPAA. Further, the majority of states have enacted state data breach laws, which also require notification of certain alleged breaches of the privacy or\nsecurity of personal information.\nFederal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the FTC and state attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure\nof personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of web site content. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information\npractices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Numerous other countries have or are developing laws governing the collection,\nuse, disclosure and transmission of personal or patient information.\nHIPAA, as well as other federal and state laws, will apply to our receipt of patient identifiable health information in connection with any clinical trials we conduct. In\naddition, we collaborate with other individuals and entities in conducting research and all involved parties must comply with applicable laws. Therefore, the compliance of the\nphysicians, hospitals or other providers or entities with which we collaborate affects our company.\nRegulations Related to Our Preclinical Development Services\nThe Animal Welfare Act (\"AWA\") governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the U.S. For these regulated species, the AWA and the\nassociated regulations promulgated thereunder require those working with regulated species to provide veterinary care and to follow specific husbandry practices such as cage\nsize, shipping conditions, sanitation and environmental enrichment to ensure the welfare of these animals. Licensing and registration\n18\nTable of Contents\nrequirement standards set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\"), and similar applicable international agencies also apply to the\ncare, handling and oversight of regulated species.\nThe import and export of animals and operations in foreign countries are subject to applicable international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of\nnational, regional and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care, handling and transport of animals by dealers and research\nfacilities.\nNon-clinical safety assessment studies used to support the submission for approval of pharmaceutical products must comply with national statutory or regulatory\nrequirements for Good Laboratory Practice (\"GLP\"). GLP regulations describe a quality system for the scientific, operational and quality process and the conditions under which\nnon-clinical studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived. GLP compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the FDA, European\nMedicines Agency and similar monitoring authorities in other countries where we operate.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of March 5, 2024, we had 107 full time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As a small, innovative company\nfocused on the development and commercialization of technology, we believe that cultural fit and energy are important considerations in recruiting employees. We assess the\nlikelihood that a particular candidate will contribute to our overall goals, and beyond their specifically assigned tasks. We aim to provide market-based compensation to retain\nour employees. New employees are provided industry-relevant compliance training and are introduced to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and all information\ncontained in this Annual Report before you decide whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects would likely suffer, possibly materially. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks\nor uncertainties, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by general economic and financial market conditions and current and\nfuture social and geopolitical instability.\nChanges in domestic and global economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher\ninflation, which is likely to lead to increased costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy. The world’s financial markets remain susceptible to significant stresses,\nresulting in reductions in available credit and government spending, economic downturn or stagnation, foreign currency fluctuations and volatility in the valuations of securities\ngenerally. As a result, our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources in the future may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Impacts from\ninflationary pressures, such an increasing costs for research and development of our products, administrative and other costs of doing business, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our customers could experience financial and operational pressures as a result of macroeconomic conditions, such as labor shortages, supply chain\ndisruptions, and increased inflation, any of which could impact their ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, increase cost of funding, cause cash flow\nproblems, or impede their ability to comply with debt covenants, which in turn could impede their ability to provide patient care, conduct further research and development,\nmarketing and commercialization efforts, or impact their profitability. To the extent that our customers continue to face such financial pressures, it could impact their\nwillingness to spend on our products and services or their ability to make payment, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe global economy has been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the ongoing conflict resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, uncertainty in\nthe Middle East region, or the increasing tensions between China and Taiwan. The negative impacts arising from the conflict and sanctions and export restrictions imposed by\nvarious countries, including those imposed by Russia, may include reduced consumer demand, supply chain disruptions, increased\n19\nTable of Contents\ncybersecurity risks, and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. Although the majority of our operations do not take place in Russia, Ukraine, Israel, China,\nor Taiwan, further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough, to date, our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflation, supply chain disruptions or labor shortages, it is\nimpossible to predict the extent to which our operations could be impacted in the short or long term, or the ways in which such matters may impact our business.\nIf we cannot maintain our current relationships, or enter into new relationships, with drug delivery customers, our revenue prospects could be reduced.\nWe collaborate with pharma/biotech, academic, and contract research organization customers (collectively “drug delivery customers”) to provide products and services\nin connection with preclinical and clinical studies. The revenue attributable to our drug delivery customers may fluctuate in the future, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the termination of these relationships could result in a temporary or permanent loss of revenue.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to maintain these relationships and to establish new relationships. Many factors have the potential to impact such\ncollaborations, including the ability to deliver therapies to our drug delivery customers’ satisfaction, regulatory approval, perceptions in connection with the safety of therapies\nor delivery mechanisms, our customers’ ability to access adequate and sustainable financing, and other factors that may be beyond our control. Furthermore, our drug delivery\ncustomers may decide to decrease or discontinue their use of our products and services due to changes in research and product development plans, failures in their clinical trials,\nfinancial constraints, utilization of internal resources or services performed by other parties. In addition to reducing our revenue, the loss of one or more of these relationships\nmay reduce our exposure to research and clinical trials that further our business objectives.\nWe engage in conversations with drug delivery customers regarding potential opportunities on an ongoing basis. There is no assurance that any of these conversations\nwill result in an agreement, or if an agreement is reached, that the resulting relationship will be successful or that preclinical, clinical, or research studies conducted as part of\nthe engagement will be continued or will produce successful outcomes.\nThe sizes of the markets for our products and services and any future products and services may be smaller than we estimate and may decline.\nOur estimates of the total addressable market for our products and services are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates and assumptions, including,\nwithout limitation, the assumed prices at which we can sell our products and services in the market. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are\nreasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the\npredictive accuracy of these underlying factors.\nAs a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our products and services in different market segments may prove to be incorrect. If the actual\nnumber of patients with indications who would benefit from our products, the price at which we can sell our products or the annual total addressable market for our products is\nsmaller than we have estimated, it may impair our prospective market and revenue opportunity.\nOur ClearPoint system may not achieve broad market adoption.\nTo date, a substantial majority of the sales of our ClearPoint System have been derived from a limited number of hospitals. Our future growth depends on our ability to\nincrease physician and patient awareness of our products, and on the willingness of hospitals to adopt our products for their neurosurgical procedures. Our ClearPoint system\nmay not gain broad market adoption unless we continue to convince physicians, hospitals and patients of its benefits. Moreover, even if physicians and hospitals understand the\nbenefits of our ClearPoint system, they still may elect not to use our ClearPoint system for a variety of reasons, such as:\n• the shift in location of the procedure from the operating room to the MRI suite;\n• demand for the MRI suite within the hospital, which may result in limited or no MRI scanner availability for procedures in which our ClearPoint system would be\nused;\n20\nTable of Contents\n• the familiarity of the established physician with other devices and surgical approaches;\n• lack of exposure to the ClearPoint system in the fellowship training period where preferences for surgical methods are formed;\n• the physician’s perception that there are insufficient benefits of our ClearPoint system relative to those other devices and surgical approaches;\n• budgetary constraints with respect to the purchase of our ClearPoint system hardware and software;\n• hospital infection control procedures;\n• the price of our ClearPoint system disposable products, which may be higher than devices used with other surgical approaches; and\n• the physician’s perception that there is a lack of clinical data on the use of our ClearPoint system.\nOur ability to execute our growth strategy and become profitable depends upon the adoption by physicians and hospitals of the ClearPoint system for use in\nneurosurgical procedures. Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from sales of the disposable products utilized with our ClearPoint system, and we are\ntherefore highly dependent on growing the installed base of the ClearPoint system for our success. We cannot provide assurance that our ClearPoint system will achieve broad\nmarket acceptance among hospitals, physicians, or patients. Any failure of the ClearPoint system to achieve meaningful market acceptance and penetration will harm our future\nprospects and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our future business growth is dependent upon marketing and selling our ClearPoint system, and other new products, in the operating room, and if we\nare unable to expand, manage and maintain our marketing and sales capabilities in this environment, we may be unable to generate significant growth in our product\nrevenues.\nWe started selling our ClearPoint system in August 2010, and to date, sales of the ClearPoint system have been primarily focused on its use for neurosurgical\nprocedures in the MRI suite. In 2021, we launched the SmartFrame Array Neuro Navigation System and Software, and in 2024, we commenced limited market release of the\nSmartFrame OR Stereotactic System. Both SmartFrame Array and SmartFrame OR allow for operating room placement of our technology. We have relatively limited\nexperience marketing and selling our ClearPoint system and products for use with neurosurgical procedures in the operating room. If our team fails to adequately promote,\nmarket and sell the ClearPoint system, and other new products that we may develop in the future, in this new environment, our sales could suffer.\nAdditionally, our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to manage the anticipated growth of our business. To achieve our business objectives,\nwe must continue to grow. However, continued growth presents numerous challenges, including:\n• expanding our sales, clinical support, product development and marketing infrastructure and capabilities;\n• expanding our assembly capacity and increasing production;\n• implementing appropriate operational and financial systems and controls;\n• improving our information systems;\n• identifying, attracting and retaining qualified personnel in our areas of activity; and\n• hiring, training, managing and supervising our personnel.\nWe cannot be certain that our systems, controls, infrastructure and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to effectively manage our\ngrowth could impede our ability to successfully develop, market and sell our products and our business will be harmed.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in the neurosurgery market by developing and commercializing new products and services\nthrough our research and development efforts, independently and through third-party collaborations.\nOur future business prospects depend in part on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services, such as the Maestro Brain Model, the ClearPoint\nPrism Neuro Laser Therapy System, SmartFrame OR, and preclinical development and device development services for pharmaceutical partners. New technologies, techniques\nor products could emerge from competitors that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our products and services. It is important that we anticipate\nchanges in technology and market demand, as well as customer preferences and practices, to successfully commercialize new technologies to meet our prospective customers’\nneeds on a timely and cost-effective basis.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe might be unable to successfully commercialize our marketed products or services or obtain authorization to market new products. The success of any new product\noffering will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n• properly identify and anticipate customer needs;\n• identify, retain, and manage third-party design and development firms, where appropriate, to accelerate development;\n• develop and introduce new products or services in a timely manner;\n• adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n• obtain and retain third-party licenses required for the development, commercialization, and/or utilization of new products;\n• demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products;\n• obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations to market new products or product enhancements;\n• deliver products and services at a price point that is both profitable and acceptable to the market; and\n• secure our supply chain to ensure we can continue to deliver products in a timely fashion to all geographies.\nIf we do not develop and obtain regulatory authorization to market new products in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products,\nour results of operations will suffer. Our internal research and development efforts and our outsourced third-party design and development initiatives may require a substantial\ninvestment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition,\neven if we are able to develop enhancements or new generations of our products successfully, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in\nexcess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying\nnew technologies or features.\nIn the ordinary course of our development and commercialization of new products and services, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint\ndevelopment, distribution, or other commercial arrangements. Proposing, negotiating and implementing such arrangements may be a lengthy, expensive, and complex process.\nWe may not identify, secure, or complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We have limited\ninstitutional knowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or\narrangement. In particular, these arrangements may not result in the development of products or services that achieve commercial success or result in significant revenues and\ncould be terminated prior to achieving their desired objectives.\nA growing part of our revenue from the biologics and drug delivery business is derived from providing consultancy to our pharmaceutical and other medical\ntechnology partners for preclinical development services, on-site clinical support and training, regulatory consultation, protocol consultation, customized device development,\nand other solutions to optimize preclinical and clinical workflows. In certain cases, these services support a novel area in which commercialization must be preceded by\npreclinical studies and FDA-mandated clinical trials, which are expensive and time consuming to conduct, and for which the commercial success is uncertain, pending, in part,\nthe outcome of those studies and trials. The maintenance and growth of our revenue from our biologics and drug delivery services is dependent on our pharmaceutical and other\nmedical technology partners continuing their development process and achieving commercial success with their therapeutic products.\nSome of our customers and partners may elect to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us for various reasons, including force majeure clauses, unexpected or\nundesired study results, dissatisfaction with our performance under the agreement, the loss or limitation of funding for research and development, or general convenience.\nCancellation or renegotiation of a large agreement could adversely affect our business and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results .In addition, we may enter into\nagreements with customers to provide services on a fixed fee basis. We may also enter into agreements with customers for which we are paid a lump sum conditioned upon the\nachievement of our customer’s development milestones. Accordingly, in these cases, we bear the risk if we underprice our contracts, overrun our cost estimates, or if there is a\nfailure by our customer to achieve the development milestones. Such events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIf coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures utilizing our products are inadequate, adoption of our products will be adversely affected\nand our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nOur products are purchased by hospitals, which bill various third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and private insurance\nplans, for procedures in which our products are used. Reimbursement is a significant factor considered by hospitals in determining whether to acquire and utilize medical\ndevices. Therefore, our ability to successfully commercialize our products depends significantly on the adequacy of coverage and reimbursement from these third-party payors.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In\naddition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and\nreimbursement for medical device products and services can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible\ncoverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly\nprocess that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate\nreimbursement will be obtained or maintained if obtained.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on\na country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many\ninternational markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance\nsystems as well as government-managed systems.\nBecause in most cases, hospitals are reimbursed for the procedures in which our products are used and our products are not separately reimbursed, the additional cost\nassociated with the use of our products could impact hospital profit margins. Some hospitals could believe third-party reimbursement levels are not adequate to cover the cost of\nour products. Furthermore, some physicians could believe third-party reimbursement levels are not adequate to compensate them for performing the procedures in which our\nproducts are used. Failure by hospitals and physicians, whether in the U.S. or abroad, to receive an amount that they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in\nwhich our products are used will deter them from purchasing or using our products and will limit our revenues and prospects for profitability.\nWe currently have significant customer concentration, so economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies or patterns of our key customers could have\na significant impact on our business and operating results.\nA small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues. In 2023, one pharmaceutical customer, a related party as described in Note 2 to the\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for whom we provide clinical services in support of the customer’s clinical trials and earn a\nquarterly fee, accounted for 12% of our total revenues, and 21% of our biologics and drug delivery revenue. Our five largest hospital customers account for approximately 27%\nof our functional neurosurgery navigation revenues. Revenues from almost all our customers are not based on long-term, committed volume purchase contracts, and we may\nnot continue to generate a similar level of revenues from our largest customers, or any other customer. Because of our current customer concentration, our revenues could\nfluctuate, possibly significantly, due to a reduction or delay in our biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers’ preclinical studies or clinical trials, or in orders from any of our\nsignificant hospital customers, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur internal manufacturing operations are generally conducted at a single location, which may limit our ability to provide an adequate supply of our products,\nand any disruption at our manufacturing facility could render us unable to produce our products, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue.\nCurrently, final assembly of many of our products’ components occurs at our Carlsbad, California facility, in an area that is at risk of experiencing serious fires and\npower outages and is considered to lie in an earthquake risk zone. If our facility experiences a disruption, we would have no other means of assembling those components until\nwe are able to restore the manufacturing capability at our current facility or develop the same capability at an alternative facility. We do not maintain a backup manufacturing\nfacility, making us dependent on our current facility for the continued operation of our business. A natural or other disaster could damage or destroy our manufacturing\nequipment and cause substantial delays in our manufacturing operations, which could lead to additional expense and decreased revenue due to lack of supply. The insurance we\nmaintain may not cover, in whole or in part, our losses in any particular case. With or without\n23\nTable of Contents\ninsurance, damage to our facility or our other property due to a natural disaster or casualty event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOur reliance on single-source suppliers for components, finished products and services could harm our ability to meet demand for our products or services in a\ntimely manner or within budget.\nMany of our components, component assemblies, and finished products are provided to us by single-source suppliers. We generally purchase components and\ncomponent assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements. We generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory for components, component\nassemblies, or finished products. We have not identified alternative suppliers for some of the finished products that we commercialize. While alternative suppliers exist and\nhave been identified for substantially all components, the disruption or termination of the supply of components and component assemblies could cause a significant increase in\nthe cost of these components, which could affect our operating results. We also depend on single-source service providers for many of the services that we perform for our\ncustomers. Our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers and service providers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies and services\ninvolve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. A disruption or termination in the supply of components or finished\nproducts could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our\nreputation. Disruptions in the global supply chain could negatively affect our single-source suppliers and could further exacerbate the risk that we are unable to meet the\ndemand for our products. Furthermore, if we are required to change the supplier of a key component or component assembly of our products, we may be required to verify that\nthe new supplier maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. Disruptions to our service providers\ncould impact our ability to provide critical services to our customers, damage our customer relationships, and cause material adverse impacts to our financial results. The delays\nassociated with the verification of a new supplier or service provider could also adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and services.\nTo the extent we seek a new indication for use of, or new claims for, our products, the FDA may not grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of such new use or\nclaims, which may affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe received 510(k) clearance to market our ClearPoint system for use in general neurosurgery interventional procedures, including DBS. We could seek to obtain\nadditional, more specific indications for use of our ClearPoint system beyond the general neurosurgical intervention claim. To the extent we seek expanded claims for our\nClearPoint system, such claims could, depending on their nature, require 510(k) clearance or FDA approval of a PMA. Moreover, some specific ClearPoint system claims could\nrequire clinical trials to support regulatory clearance or approval. In the event we seek a new indication for use of, or new claims for, the ClearPoint system that we believe are\nnecessary or desirable for successful commercialization, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Likewise, to the extent clinical trials are\nnecessary, we may not successfully complete or have the funds to initiate such clinical trials.\nOur SmartFlow Cannula has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for use in the U.S. for the aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”), or injection of Cytarabine\ninto the ventricles. It has also been CE marked for use in the EU for the delivery of approved fluids into the brain or aspiration of CSF. The SmartFlow Cannula is being utilized\nin approved combination product clinical and preclinical studies by pharmaceutical companies and academic research customers for various research and clinical trials in\nconnection with delivery of therapeutic agents. The growth of our drug delivery and biologics business is dependent upon our pharmaceutical company customers’ ability to\nobtain regulatory approval for the use of the SmartFlow Cannula for delivery of their therapeutic agent, and/or our ability to expand the cleared indications for our SmartFlow\nCannula to include delivery of our pharmaceutical company customers’ therapeutic agents. To the extent that our pharmaceutical partners are not successful in obtaining\nregulatory approval, or if we are unable to expand the cleared indications for use of our SmartFlow Cannula, we may not be able to grow our business.\nClinical trials necessary to support 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for any new indications for use of our products would be expensive and could require the\nenrollment of large numbers of suitable patients, who could be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in any necessary clinical trials would prevent us from\ncommercializing any modified product or new product candidate and could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for our existing products or any other product candidates that we may\ndevelop, or additional safety and efficacy data that the FDA may require for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for any new specific indications of our products that we may\nseek, would be time consuming and expensive with an uncertain outcome. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily\n24\nTable of Contents\npredictive of future results, and any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical trials could require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients could be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient\nenrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial\nprotocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators\nand support staff, the proximity to clinical sites of patients that are able to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial, and patient\ncompliance. For example, patients could be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or\nfollow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve\nunacceptable risks or discomforts. In addition, patients participating in clinical trials may die before completion of the trial or suffer adverse medical events unrelated to our\nproduct candidates.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy will be required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to\nsupport clearance or approval. Further, the FDA could require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up\nperiod or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a\nclinical trial could cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our product candidates or result in the failure of the clinical trial.\nSuch increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we fail to obtain the necessary clearances, certifications or approvals for our new products, our ability to grow our business globally could be harmed.\nOur business growth is dependent upon our ability to market and sell new products, including new therapy devices and devices to allow us to expand our business into\nthe operating room. Unless and until we obtain FDA clearance, authorization or approval for the new products in our pipeline, we will not be able to sell or promote them in the\nU.S. Under FDA regulations, unless exempt, a new medical device may only be commercially distributed after it has received 510(k) clearance, is authorized through the de\nnovo classification process, or is the subject of an approved PMA. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the\nnew product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product not subject to a PMA. Sometimes, premarket submissions must be supported by clinical data.\nClinical trials are expensive, time consuming, and their outcomes are uncertain. The PMA process typically is more costly, lengthy and stringent than the 510(k) process and\nusually requires more substantial clinical studies.\nThe FDA may not authorize marketing via de novo classification or clear our 510(k) applications on a timely basis or at all. For example, during the peak of the COVID-\n19 outbreak, the FDA experienced delays in the review of applications and concentrated their focus on products which addressed the COVID-19 outbreak. Such delays or\nrefusals, regardless of the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The FDA may also change its clearance and\nauthorization policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay authorization or clearance of our products.\nSimilar restrictions exist outside of the U.S.\nTo sell our products in member countries of the EU, our products must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council\nDirective 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in\nthe EU. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device\nand its (risk) classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its\nproducts with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited or\nlicensed by a member state of the EU to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body\nwould typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a certificate\nof conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with\nthe essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of\nConformity.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAs a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the\nevaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device\nachieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed\nagainst the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. If we fail to\nremain in compliance with applicable European laws and directives and national member states laws, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE mark to our products,\nwhich would prevent us from selling them within the EU.\nThere is no assurance that future clearance or approval of our new products will be granted, or that we will be able to continue selling our products in any geography.\nSuch failures could hurt our ability to maintain and grow our business.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or any additional claims we may seek for our products and may result in the\ndiscovery of adverse side effects.\nEven if any clinical trial that we need to undertake is completed as planned, we cannot be certain that its results will support our product candidate claims or any new\nindications that we may seek for our products or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding the results of those trials. The clinical trial process\nmay fail to demonstrate that our products or a product candidate is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use, which could cause us to stop seeking additional clearances\nor approvals for our products or abandon or delay development of other product candidates. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our regulatory\nsubmissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize a product candidate. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that\nare not currently part of the product candidate’s profile.\nThe markets for medical devices are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively against the larger, well-established companies in our\nmarkets or emerging and small innovative companies that may seek to obtain or increase their share of the market.\nWe will continue to face competition from products and techniques already in existence in the marketplace. The markets for medical devices used in neurosurgical\nprocedures is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors are much larger and have substantially more financial and human resources than we do. Many have long\nhistories and strong reputations within the industry, and a relatively small number of companies dominate these markets. Examples of such large, well-known companies\ninclude Medtronic, Abbott, Elekta and Brainlab.\nThese companies enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including:\n• broad product offerings, which address the needs of physicians and hospitals in a wide range of procedures and allow for price bundling;\n• greater experience in, and resources for, launching, marketing, distributing and selling products, including strong sales forces and established distribution networks;\n• existing relationships with physicians and hospitals;\n• more extensive intellectual property portfolios and resources for patent protection;\n• greater financial and other resources for product research and development;\n• greater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements;\n• established manufacturing operations and contract manufacturing relationships; and\n• significantly greater name recognition and more recognizable trademarks.\nWe may not succeed in overcoming the competitive advantages of these large and established companies. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be\nsignificant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may introduce products that compete\neffectively against our products in terms of performance, price or both.\nWe sell our products outside of the U.S., and we are subject to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks relating to international operations, which\ncould harm our revenue and profitability.\nWe sell our products in several countries outside of the U.S. Our business strategy includes plans for expansion in countries where we currently operate as well as the\nintroduction of our products to other international markets. Doing\n26\nTable of Contents\nbusiness outside of the U.S. exposes us to risks distinct from those we face in our domestic operations. For example, our operations outside of the U.S. are subject to different\nregulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where we operate or have sales. Our failure, or the failure of our distributors, to comply with current or future foreign regulatory\nrequirements, or the assertion by foreign authorities that we or our distributors have failed to comply, could result in adverse consequences, including enforcement actions, fines\nand penalties, recalls, cessation of sales, civil and criminal prosecution, and the consequences could be disproportionate to the relative contribution of our international\noperations to our results of operations.\nEngaging in business outside of the U.S. inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including, but not limited to:\n• export restrictions and controls relating to technology;\n• pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n• difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n• political and economic instability;\n• consequences arising from natural disasters and other similar catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis;\n• potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n• the need to hire additional personnel to promote our products outside of the U.S.;\n• international terrorism and anti-American sentiment;\n• fluctuations in exchange rates for future sales denominated in foreign currency;\n• difficulty in obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights; and\n• changing regulatory environments such as the European Medical Device Regulation.\nIn addition, our business practices in foreign countries must comply with U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We have a compliance\nprogram in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of the FCPA and other U.S. and foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. If violations were to\noccur, they could subject us to fines and other penalties as well as increased compliance costs.\nOur exposure to each of these risks may increase our costs and require significant management attention.\nDisruptions of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations and financial\ncondition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our\ncustomers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees on our networks, and on third party-controlled applications.\nThe secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. The information technology and infrastructure which\nwe rely upon may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and\nthe information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or\nproceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to customers,\nand damage to our reputation and loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, operating margins, revenues and competitive\nposition. In addition, the regulatory environment regarding data security and privacy evolves frequently and has become increasingly restrictive.\nWe also rely in part on third-party information technology systems to store information, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy, secure our data and\naccurately produce our financial statements. If our information technology systems do not effectively and securely collect, store, process and report relevant data for the\noperation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, human error or cyber incident, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and\nexecute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations would be materially impaired. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and the timeliness in which we report our operating results.\nOur insurance coverage related to information risks, breaches, and business interruption is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to\nmaintain our current insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. If we are unable to\nobtain insurance at an\n27\nTable of Contents\nacceptable cost or on acceptable terms or otherwise protect against such information risks and breach claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities.\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures, or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our\nstockholders’ ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions or investments in other companies or technologies. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint\nventures that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. We have no experience with acquiring or investing in other\ncompanies and limited experience in forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition or investment candidates, and we\nmay not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our\nexisting business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and\ncontingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also\nmay disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may experience losses related to\ninvestments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely\nmanner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance, or joint venture.\nTo finance any investments, acquisitions or joint ventures, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds\nmay not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe need to hire and retain additional qualified personnel to grow and manage our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, including\nour senior management team, our sales, clinical support and marketing team and our engineering team, our business and growth could be seriously harmed.\nOur performance depends on the talents and efforts of our employees. Our future success will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization, but particularly as part of our sales, clinical support, product development and marketing teams. We plan to continue to grow our\nbusiness and will need to hire additional personnel to support this growth. It is often difficult to hire and retain these persons, and we may be unable to replace key persons if\nthey leave or fill new positions requiring key persons with appropriate experience, particularly in light of current labor market conditions. If we experience difficulties locating\nand hiring suitable personnel in the future, our growth may be hindered. Qualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the medical device industry, and we may incur\nsignificant costs to attract and retain them. If we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to succeed, our business and growth could be harmed.\nAll our employees, including the members of our senior management team, are at-will employees, and therefore they may terminate employment with us at any time.\nAccordingly, there are no assurances that the services of any of our employees will be available to us for any specified period of time. The loss of members of our senior\nmanagement team, our sales, clinical support and marketing team or our engineering team, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If the need to replace any of our key employees arises, the search and recruiting process likely\nwould involve significant time and costs, and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, and we may continue to incur losses. If we fail to generate significant revenue from sales of our products and\nservices, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 1998 that have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our sales and marketing\nactivities, research and development efforts, manufacturing activities and other general and administrative expenses associated with our operations, and we may continue to\nincur losses as we continue to invest capital in the sales and marketing of our ClearPoint platform products and services, and growth of our business generally.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medical devices and with our biologic and drug delivery customers’ development of safe\nand effective drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Our profitability will depend on revenues from the sale\nof our products and services. Additionally, increases in our various costs that may be the result of inflationary pressures could further reduce our sales and profitability. We\ncannot provide any assurance that we will ever achieve profitability and, even if we achieve profitability, that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or\nannual basis. Further, because of our relatively limited commercialization history in our biologics and drug delivery business, we have limited insight into the trends that may\nemerge and affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business and financial condition. Any failure\nto achieve and maintain profitability would continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital and could result in a decline in our stock price or\ncause us to cease operations.\nWe expect to need additional funding for our business, and we may not be able to raise capital when needed or on terms that are acceptable to us, which could\nforce us to delay, reduce or eliminate our commercialization efforts or our product development programs.\nThe cumulative net loss from our inception through December 31, 2023 was approximately $172 million. Net cash used in operations was $13.7 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023. Since our inception, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of notes payable. At\nDecember 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalent balances aggregating $23.1 million, resulting primarily from a 2021 public offering and note issuances pursuant to the\n2020 Financing Transaction as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We also completed a public common\nstock offering in March 2024 providing net proceeds of approximately $14.0 million.\nOur plans for the next twelve months reflect our anticipation of increases in revenues from sales of our hardware products and related disposable products as a result of\ngreater utilization at existing installed sites and the installation of our products at new sites, as well as payments from strategic partnerships, consulting services and sales of\nsystems and disposables to our pharmaceutical partners for gene and stem cell therapy trials. We also anticipate increases over the next twelve months in operating expenses to\nsupport the expected increase in revenues, with resulting decreases in loss from operations and in cash flow used in operations. However, there is no assurance that we will be\nable to achieve anticipated results, and even in the event such results are achieved, we expect to continue to consume cash in operations over at least the next twelve months.\nAs a result of the foregoing, it is uncertain whether or not it will be necessary to seek additional sources of funds from the sale of equity or other debt securities, which\nlikely would result in dilution to existing ownership interests, from the establishment of a credit facility, or from entry into an agreement with a strategic partner or some other\nform of collaborative relationship. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and there\nis no assurance that any additional financing we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we may be\nunable to achieve anticipated results, and may not be able to meet other obligations as they become due. An inability to obtain a sufficient amount of additional funding would\ncreate substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe funding requirements for our business will depend on many factors, including:\n• the timing of broader market acceptance and adoption of our ClearPoint platform products and services;\n• the scope, rate of progress and cost of our ongoing product development activities relating to our ClearPoint system;\n• the cost and timing of expanding our sales, clinical support, marketing and distribution capabilities and other corporate infrastructure;\n• the cost and timing of establishing inventories at levels sufficient to support our sales;\n• the scope, rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities relating to new products;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n• the costs, terms and timing of any future investments or acquisitions, or collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n• the cost and timing of any clinical trials;\n• the cost and timing of regulatory filings, clearances and approvals; and\n• the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\n29\nTable of Contents\nRaising additional funds may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms may\ninclude liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect such existing stockholders’ rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants\nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we secure additional funds\nthrough arrangements with a strategic or other collaboration partner, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, products or product candidates or grant\nlicenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our commercialization and/or product development goals and\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are subject to economic risk.\nThe Company may invest its cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities in domestic bank deposits, money market funds, U.S. Government debt\nsecurities, corporate debt, and certificates of deposit. Certain types of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. In the event these\nrisks caused a decline in value of any of the Company’s investments, it could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition.\nWe currently, and may in the future, have assets held at financial institutions that may exceed the insurance coverage offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\"FDIC\"), and the loss of such assets could have a negative effect on our operations and liquidity.\nIn early 2023, multiple banks were closed by regulatory agencies and swept into receivership. We currently have our cash and cash equivalents held in deposit in\naccounts at certain FDIC-insured financial institutions, some of which include amounts in excess of the insurance coverage offered by the FDIC. In the future, we may maintain\nour cash assets at financial institutions in the United States in amounts that may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. Though to date, we have experienced no\nloss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts, in the event of a failure of any of these financial institutions where we maintain our deposits or other assets, we may\nincur a loss to the extent such deposits or assets exceeds the FDIC insurance limitation, which could have a material adverse effect upon our liquidity, financial condition and\nour results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we, or the third parties from whom we license intellectual property, are unable to secure and maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for the\nintellectual property covering our marketed products or our product candidates, our ability to compete will be harmed.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in our products and product\ncandidates. The patent positions of medical device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. Our patent\nposition is uncertain and complex, in part, because of our dependence on intellectual property that we license from others. If we, or the third parties from whom we license\nintellectual property, fail to obtain adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for intellectual property covering our products or product candidates, or if any\nprotection is reduced or eliminated, others could use the intellectual property covering our products or product candidates, resulting in harm to our competitive business\nposition. In addition, patent and other intellectual property protection may not provide us with a competitive advantage against competitors that devise ways of making\ncompetitive products without infringing any patents that we own or to which we have rights.\nU.S. patents and patent applications may be subject to interference proceedings and U.S. patents may be subject to inter partes proceedings (“IPRs”), reissue and\nreexamination proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding\nforeign patent offices. Any of these proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the\nclaims of the patent or patent application. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the\nscope of our protection. Interference, IPRs, reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly and time consuming, and we, or the third parties from whom we license\nintellectual property, may be unsuccessful in such proceedings. Thus, any patents that we\n30\nTable of Contents\nown or license may provide limited or no protection against competitors. In addition, our pending patent applications and those we may file in the future may not result in\npatents being issued or may have claims that do not cover our products or product candidates. Even if any of our pending or future patent applications are issued, they may not\nprovide us with adequate protection or any competitive advantages. Our ability to develop additional patentable technology is also uncertain.\nNon-payment or delay in payment of patent fees or annuities, whether intentional or unintentional, may also result in the loss of patents or patent rights important to\nour business. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third\nparties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the\npatent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual\nproperty rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S., particularly in the field of medical devices and procedures.\nOthers may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to engage in costly disputes and, if we are not successful in\ndefending ourselves, could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our marketed products.\nThere may be U.S. and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to our business. Some of these patents may be broad enough to cover one or more aspects of\nour present technologies and/or may cover aspects of our future technologies. We do not know whether any of these patents, if they exist and if asserted, would be held valid,\nenforceable and infringed. We cannot provide any assurance that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we may have concerning\ninvalidity, unenforceability or non-infringement of any third-party patent. The medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative\nproceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed such actions to gain a competitive advantage. If third parties assert\ninfringement or other intellectual property claims against us, our management personnel will experience a significant diversion of time and effort and we will incur large\nexpenses defending our company. If third parties in any patent action are successful, our patent portfolio may be damaged, we may have to pay substantial damages and we\nmay be required to stop selling our products or obtain a license which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. We cannot be certain that we will have the\nfinancial resources or the substantive arguments to defend our products from infringement or our patents from claims of invalidity or unenforceability, or to defend our products\nagainst allegations of infringement of third-party patents. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us, or initiated or\nthreatened against us, could negatively impact our business.\nIf the combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate, our ability to successfully\ncommercialize our marketed products and product candidates will be harmed, and we may not be able to operate our business profitably.\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent,\ncopyright, trademark and trade secret law and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. However, such methods may not be adequate to protect us or permit\nus to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. Our patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us, or at all. Our issued patents, and those\nthat may issue in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products.\nTo protect our proprietary rights, we may in the future need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property. There can be no\nassurance that we will be successful on the merits in any enforcement effort. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual\nproperty rights. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights or trademarks is highly unpredictable, expensive and time consuming and would\ndivert human and monetary resources away from managing our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\neven if we were to prevail in such litigation. In the event of an adverse judgment, a court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed,\nor that they are invalid or unenforceable, and could award attorney fees.\nDespite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this\nregard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technologies or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our\nproducts, technologies or other information that we regard as proprietary. Additionally, third parties may be able to design around\n31\nTable of Contents\nour patents. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Our inability to adequately protect our\nintellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technologies, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.\nWe have entered into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and consultants as one of the ways we seek to protect our\nintellectual property and other proprietary technologies. However, these agreements may not be enforceable, or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or\nother proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements.\nOur employees and consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide\nan adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our proprietary know-\nhow is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect know-how than courts in the\nU.S. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection could\nadversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe rely on patent rights and licenses from third parties which are subject to termination or expiration.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest\nUnited States non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited.\nEven if patents covering our products are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, as our ability to\nprevent competitors from copying our technology may be limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of potential new\nmedical technologies, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Additionally, should any patent licenses be\nprematurely terminated for any reason, or if the patents and intellectual property assigned to us or owned by third parties that we have licensed are challenged or defeated, our\nresearch efforts could be materially and adversely affected. There is also the related risk that we may not be able to make the required payments under any patent license, in\nwhich case we may lose to ability to use one or more of the licensed patents. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to\nexclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThird parties may attempt to commercialize competitive products in foreign countries where we do not have any patents or patent applications and/or where legal\nrecourse may be limited. This may have a significant commercial impact on our foreign business operations.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may\nnot protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all\ncountries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection. In particular, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against\ncertain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately\nbe sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection\nin certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. Even in foreign jurisdictions that enforce intellectual property rights to the same or a\nsimilar extent as do the laws of the United States, uneven enforcement and procedural barriers may exist in such countries, and proceedings to enforce our intellectual property\nrights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\nnarrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not being issued and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we\ninitiate, and the damages or other\n32\nTable of Contents\nremedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to\nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we lose access to third-party software that is integrated into our products, our costs could increase and new installations of our products could be delayed,\npotentially hurting our competitive position.\nWe have received licenses from third parties to certain software that is integrated into the software components of our products. In return, we have agreed to pay\nlicense fees and royalties subject to commercial arrangements with such third-party licensors. A loss of any of the licenses could impede our ability to offer and sell our\nproducts to customers until equivalent software could be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our products. These delays, if they occur, would harm our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our products are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe rely, in part, upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our products\nand technology. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology, and we may not have intellectual property rights\nthrough such licenses in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future. As a result, we may not be able to prevent\ncompetitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories included in all of our licenses.\nIn addition, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of patents and patent applications covering\nthe technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained,\nenforced and defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend such patents, or lose rights\nto those patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our right to develop and commercialize any of our products that are\nsubject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nOur licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not in sole and exclusive control or\nmay not be the sole owners of the patents we in-license. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be\nsusceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to\nthe relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. In spite of our best efforts, our\nlicensors might also conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements and terminate the license agreements, thereby removing our ability to develop and\ncommercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory\napproval of, and to market, products identical to ours. In addition, we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors and, in connection with obtaining such licenses,\nwe may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more favorable to the licensors, including by agreeing to larger financial commitments. Any of these\nevents could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nWe operate in a highly-regulated industry and any failure to comply with the extensive government regulations may subject us to fines, injunctions and other\npenalties that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Government regulations and foreign\nrequirements specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things:\n• design, development and manufacturing;\n• preclinical and clinical testing;\n33\nTable of Contents\n• testing, labeling and storage;\n• product safety;\n• marketing, sales and distribution;\n• premarket clearance, authorization, or approval;\n• recordkeeping procedures;\n• advertising and promotions;\n• recalls and field corrective actions;\n• post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; and\n• product export.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including: required submissions of safety and other post-market information; manufacturing facility registration\nand device listing requirements; compliance with medical device current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, as codified in the QSR; requirements regarding field\ncorrections and removals of our marketed products; reporting of adverse events and certain product malfunctions to regulatory bodies; and numerous recordkeeping\nrequirements. If we or any of our collaborators or suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may take action against us, including\nany of the following sanctions:\n• untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n• customer notifications or orders for the repair or replacement of our products or refunds;\n• recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n• operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n• refusing or delaying requests for regulatory approvals of new products or modified products;\n• withdrawing regulatory submissions that have already been granted; or\n• refusing to grant export approval for our products.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation, administrative, or executive action, either in the\nU.S. or abroad. For example, the Biden administration has taken and will continue to take executive actions, some of which could impact us and our business. The\nimplementation of new policies and priorities by future administrations are unknown and could materially impact the regulation of our products. If executive actions impose\nconstraints on the FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, our biologics and drug delivery business may be subject to regulations and guidance concerning the procurement and use of research animals for research\npurposes. Such regulations and guidance are evolving and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and\ninternational basis. Our failure to comply with these regulations and guidance could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFederal legislation and other payment and policy changes may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSince enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, there have been a number of legal challenges as well as other legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare\nsystem that could limit the acceptance and availability of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results and business. The full effects of the\nAffordable Care Act may be unknown until all outstanding legal issues are resolved, the statutory provisions are fully implemented, and CMS, the FDA, and other federal and\nstate agencies issue final applicable regulations or guidance. These developments could result in increased coordination between hospitals and physicians and alignment of\nfinancial incentives between hospitals and physicians to control hospital costs. Such payment reform efforts and increased coordination among hospitals and physicians may\nlead to voluntary reductions in the array of choices currently available to physicians with respect to diagnostic services, medical supplies and equipment, which could result in\nhospitals reducing the overall number of vendors from which they purchase supplies, equipment and products. The Affordable Care Act may continue to be periodically subject\nto legal challenges or a continuing political effort to limit its scope. While we do not expect the Biden Administration to modify or repeal the Affordable Care Act, we cannot\noffer assurances that the political situation regarding the Affordable Care Act will not change in the future in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business or\nresults of operations.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, or the Medicare Access Act, removed the sustainable growth rate or SGR, methodology applicable to fees for\nphysician services. The Medicare Access Act also replaced the previous fee-for-service payment system with a more value-based system. As a result, reimbursements from the\nMedicare\n34\nTable of Contents\nprogram may be reduced. As noted above, failure by hospitals and physicians to receive an amount that they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in which our\nproducts are used may deter them from purchasing or using our products and will limit our sales growth.\nThe Affordable Care Act also imposes, among other things, an annual excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S.\nIn December 2019, President Trump signed into law a permanent repeal of the medical device tax under the Affordable Care Act, but there is no guarantee that such repeal will\nnot reverse course in the future. If such an excise tax on sales of our products in the U.S. is enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\"), aimed at curbing inflationary pressures, may have direct and indirect consequences for pharmaceutical and biotech companies in\nthe context of their research and development expenditures. In particular, the IRA measures to control inflation have implications for future drug pricing. Our pharmaceutical\nand biotech customers rely on predictable pricing to fund research and development efforts. If pricing flexibility is constrained, these companies may limit spending on their\npipeline, which may adversely affect the future revenue of our biologics and drug delivery business.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state\nlevel, or the effect any recently promulgated or future legislation or regulation will have on us. However, an expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may\nlower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business, possibly materially.\nOur products may be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business operating results and financial condition. Likewise, products that are\nmanufactured and sold by third parties and that are needed for procedures in which physicians use our products also may be subject to recalls, which could adversely\nimpact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or\ndefects in design, manufacture or labeling. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that\nthe device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material\ndeficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-\nmandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any\nof our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may initiate certain\nvoluntary recalls involving our products in the future. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. If we determine\nthat certain of those recalls do not require notification to the FDA, the FDA may disagree with our determinations and require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall\nannouncement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement actions against us, which could impair\nour ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner to meet our customers’ demands. Regulatory investigations or product recalls could also result in our\nincurring substantial costs, losing revenues and implementing a change in the design, manufacturing process or the indications for which our products may be used, each of\nwhich would harm our business.\nIn addition, products that are manufactured and sold by other companies and that are needed for procedures in which physicians use ClearPoint devices also could\nbecome subject to a recall. ClearPoint devices are designed to enable a range of minimally invasive procedures in the brain. Those procedures involve insertion of a catheter,\nprobe, electrode or other similar device into a target region of the brain, and most of those devices are manufactured and sold by other companies. Any of those devices may\nbecome the subject of a recall, whether required by the FDA or a foreign governmental body or initiated by the third-party manufacturer. The shortage or absence of any of\nthose devices in the marketplace could adversely impact the number of procedures performed by physicians using our ClearPoint devices, which would adversely impact our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations,\nwhich can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\n35\nTable of Contents\nUnder the FDA’s Medical Device Reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a\ndeath or serious injury or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In the future, we\nmay experience events that may require reporting to the FDA pursuant to the medical device reporting regulations. In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices in EU\nmarkets are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the relevant authority in whose jurisdiction the incident\noccurred. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as\ninspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the\ndedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. In addition, failure to report such\nadverse events to appropriate government authorities on a timely basis, or at all, could result in an enforcement action against us.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting off-label uses of our products in violation of federal and state regulations in the U.S. or\nelsewhere.\nWe have obtained 510(k) clearance of the products that we commercialize for defined indications. Promotion or marketing of our products for any indications for use\nother than that cleared by the FDA would be considered off-label use.\nUnder the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other similar laws, we are prohibited from labeling or promoting our products, or training physicians, for such off-\nlabel uses. The FDA defines labeling to include not only the physical label attached to the product, but also items accompanying the product. This definition also includes items\nas diverse as materials that appear on a company’s website. As a result, we are not permitted to promote off-label uses of our products, whether on our website, in product\nbrochures or in customer communications. However, although manufacturers are not permitted to promote for off-label uses, in their practice of medicine, physicians may\nlawfully choose to use medical devices for off-label uses. Therefore, a physician could use our products for uses not covered by the cleared labeling.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing\nclearance or approval has not been obtained. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we\nmodify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure,\ncivil fine and criminal penalties. We could be enjoined from selling some or all of our products for any unapproved uses. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign\nenforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant\nfines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and market adoption\nof our products would be impaired. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims.\nProduct liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management’s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nIf we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with the FDA’s QSR or any applicable state equivalent, our manufacturing operations could be interrupted, and\nour potential product sales and operating results could suffer.\nWe and some of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA’s QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production,\ncontrol, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products and product candidates. We and our suppliers will also be subject to the\nregulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process to the extent we market our products in these jurisdictions. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic\nand unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Our facilities were last subject to an ISO 13485 surveillance audit and MDSAP surveillance audit in April 2023. We\nanticipate that we and certain of our third-party suppliers will be subject to future inspections. The failure by us or one of our third-party suppliers to comply with applicable\nstatutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations, could\nresult in enforcement actions against us, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner to meet our customers’ demands. If we fail\nto comply with the FDA’s QSR or any applicable state equivalent, we would be required to incur the costs and take the actions necessary to bring our operations into\ncompliance, which may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate a profit.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are\nunable to fully comply with such laws.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products or the procedures in\nwhich our products may be used, many state and federal healthcare laws and regulations governing financial relationships between medical device companies and healthcare\nproviders apply to our business and we could be subject to enforcement by both the federal government, private whistleblowers and the states in which we conduct our business.\nThe healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n• The federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting,\nreceiving, offering or providing any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the purchase, lease or order, or\narranging for or recommending of, any item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid\nprograms.\n• Federal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment\nto Medicare, Medicaid or other federally-funded healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services not provided as claimed, and which\nmay apply to entities like us to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices. Changes to the federal false claims law\nenacted as part of the Affordable Care Act will likely increase the number of whistleblower cases brought against providers and suppliers of health care items and\nservices.\n• The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which established new federal crimes for knowingly and\nwillfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare\nbenefits, items or services.\n• State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as: (i) anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services\nreimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; and (ii) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may apply to interactions with foreign\ngovernment officials, including physician employees of a foreign government entity, by our employees and third-party business partners.\n• The Affordable Care Act, which imposes certain reporting obligations on manufacturers of drugs, devices and biologics. Specifically, such manufacturers are\nrequired to report payments or other transfers of value to or on behalf of physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance care nurses or teaching hospitals\nby such manufacturers, as well as any ownership or investment interest held by physicians in such manufacturers. Violations of the reporting requirements are\nsubject to civil monetary penalties.\n• The Affordable Care Act also grants the Office of Inspector General additional authority to obtain information from any individual or entity to validate claims for\npayment or to evaluate the economy, efficiency or effectiveness of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, expands the permissible exclusion authority to include\nany false statements or misrepresentations of material facts, enhances the civil monetary penalties for false statements or misrepresentation of material facts, and\nenhances the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for those convicted of federal healthcare offenses.\nThe medical device industry has been under heightened scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and government enforcement or private whistleblower\nactions under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act involving manufacturers who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an\nattempt to procure their business, including specifically arrangements with physician consultants.\nWe may from time to time have agreements with physicians that could be scrutinized or could be subject to reporting requirements in the future, including consulting\ncontracts in which we compensate physicians for various services, which could include:\n• providing training and other similar services on the proper use of our products;\n• advising us with respect to the commercialization of products in their respective fields;\n• keeping us informed of new developments in their respective fields of practice;\n• advising us on our research and development projects related to their respective fields;\n• advising us on improvements to methods, processes and devices related to their respective fields (such as advice on the development of prototype devices); and\n37\nTable of Contents\n• assisting us with the technical evaluation of our methods, processes and devices related to their respective fields.\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates increased transparency of arrangements between physicians and medical device companies. We believe that this increased\ntransparency may also result in a heightened level of government scrutiny of the relationships between physicians and medical device companies. While we believe that all of\nour arrangements with physicians comply with applicable law, the increased level of scrutiny, coupled with the expanded enforcement tools available to the government under\nthe Affordable Care Act, may increase the likelihood of a governmental investigation. If we become subject to such an investigation, our business and operations would be\nadversely affected even if we ultimately prevail because the cost of defending such investigation would be substantial. Moreover, companies subject to governmental\ninvestigations could lose both overall market value and market share during the course of the investigation.\nIn addition, we may provide customers with information on products that could be deemed to influence their coding or billing practices, and may have sales,\nmarketing or other arrangements with hospitals and other providers that could also be the subject of scrutiny under these laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of\nany of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines,\nexclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is\nincreased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we\nsuccessfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. If the physicians or\nother providers or entities with which we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative\nimpact on our business.\nWe are subject to various laws protecting the confidentiality and security of certain personal information, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and\nreputational damage.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations protecting the confidentiality and security of certain patient health information, and our failure to comply with such\nlaws and regulations could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWithin the U.S., numerous federal and state laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information may apply to us, including, without\nlimitation, HIPAA, state data privacy laws (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act), state data breach notification laws, state\nhealth information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. In addition, in certain cases, we may be a business associate of our HIPAA covered entity\ncustomers by virtue of receiving individually identifiable health information (referred to as “Protected Health Information” or “PHI”) from these customers. In these business\nassociate relationships, we must comply with applicable HIPAA requirements, state data privacy and security requirements, and the contractual terms of our business associate\nagreements that govern its permitted uses and disclosures of PHI received from the covered entity counterparty. Our failure to comply with any of these laws may result in\ncriminal and civil liability. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations which may adversely affect our business.\nOutside the U.S., numerous countries in which we operate, manufacture, and sell our products have, or are developing, laws protecting data privacy and the\nconfidentiality of certain personal data. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) introduced new data protection requirements in the European\nEconomic Area and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules. The GDPR applies extraterritorially, and we may be subject to the GDPR because of our EU\nsubsidiaries and potential data processing activities that involve the personal data of individuals located in the EU, such as in connection with any EU customers, EU clinical\ntrials or related to any employees in the EU. The GDPR imposes strict obligations and restrictions on controllers and processors of personal data, which could cause our costs of\ncompliance to increase, potentially leading to harm to our business and financial condition.\nGlobally, the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data\nprotection issues that may affect our business. There is a degree of uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws,\nwhich continue to develop in ways we cannot predict. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose\ninconsistent or conflicting requirements. Varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business\npractices in a manner adverse to our business.\n38\nTable of Contents\nA determination that we have violated privacy or data protection laws could result in significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the\naggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the U.S. will be the\nexclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes\nwith us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction,\nanother State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum (to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable\njurisdictional requirements) for claims in the right of the corporation that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder in\nsuch capacity, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the U.S. will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring\nany interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such\nprovisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings. It is possible that a\ncourt could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our Fourth Amended and Restated\nBylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm\nour business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and a stockholder may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which the shares were\npurchased.\nCompanies trading in the stock market in general have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating\nperformance. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the\nfollowing:\n• Failure to successfully develop our products;\n• Changes in laws or regulations applicable to future products;\n• Inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n• Adverse regulatory decisions;\n• Introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n• Failure to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public;\n• Inability to obtain additional funding;\n• Failure to meet or exceed the financial projections of the investment community;\n• Disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our\ntechnologies;\n• Additions or departures of key personnel;\n• Significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n• Changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n• Purchases and sales of our common stock resulting from, related to or arising out of (i) recent stock run-ups or recent divergences in valuations relative to those\nseen during traditional markets, (ii) high short interest or reported short squeezes, or (iii) reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest (whether on social\nmedia or otherwise);\n• Sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n39\nTable of Contents\n• Trading volume of our common stock.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to\nlimitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to substantial limitations\narising from previous ownership changes. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change\nunder Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs. Furthermore, our\nability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal taxable income. We have incurred net losses since our inception and\nanticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income\nnecessary to utilize our NOLs.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business\nand, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and\nwill depend on our results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, contractual arrangements, any limitations on payments of dividends present in any\nof our future debt agreements and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, a return on our stockholders’ investment will only occur\nif our stock price appreciates.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control.\nWe have 90,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, and 26,976,289 shares outstanding as of March 5, 2024. As a result, our Board will be able to issue a\nsubstantial number of additional shares of common stock, without seeking stockholder approval. In addition, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as\nprovisions of Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it\nmore difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions:\n• permit our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve\nan acquisition or other change in our control;\n• provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors;\n• provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n• require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written\nconsent;\n• provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of\nstockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice;\n• do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors\nto elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose);\n• provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or by the Board of\nDirectors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and\n• provide that stockholders will be permitted to amend our bylaws only upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding\nshares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any broad\nrange of business combinations with any stockholder who owns, or at any time in the last three years owned, 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, for a period of three\nyears following\n40\nTable of Contents\nthe date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is\ndesired by or beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause a decline in our\nstock price.\nWe publicly provide financial guidance about our business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, our management makes certain assumptions and\njudgments about our future operating performance, including projected hiring of personnel, continued increase of our revenue, and continued stability of the macro-economic\nenvironment in our key markets. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our\nfuture performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and\nwhich could adversely affect our operations and operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly\nannounced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors, or other interested parties, the market price of our common stock could\ndecline.\nSecurities analysts may not continue, or additional securities analysts may not initiate, coverage for our common stock or may issue negative reports. This may\nhave a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nSecurities analysts provide research coverage of our common stock. Some analysts may publish statements that do not portray our technology, products or procedures\nusing our product in a positive light. If we are unable to educate those who publicize such reports about the benefits we believe our business provides, or if one or more of the\nanalysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could\nlose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports\nthat industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If sufficient securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely\naffect the market price of our common stock. It may be difficult for companies such as ours, with smaller market capitalizations, to attract and maintain sufficient independent\nfinancial analysts that will cover our common stock. This could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock. We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance\nor other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause a decline in our stock price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nDamage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, suppliers, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources,\nincluding employee misconduct, security and privacy breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, and scrutiny in connection with federal and state\nhealthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations. Such harm could also, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or\nsubject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.\nThe preclinical services that our biologics and drug delivery business provides to our customers are essential to drug discovery and development processes, and a\nsignificant number of these services are mandated by law. Notwithstanding, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes.\nHistorically, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt such services, impacting the\nindustry. This may, in the future, include periodic demonstrations near facilities operated or utilized by us. Any negative attention, threats, acts of vandalism or legal action\ndirected against our preclinical service activities, or our third-party service providers could harm our reputation and impair our ability to operate our business efficiently.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe could become subject to product liability or professional liability claims that could be expensive, divert management’s attention and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical devices. We may be held liable if our\nproducts cause injury or death or are found otherwise unsuitable or defective during usage. Our ClearPoint system, ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, and other\nproducts may incorporate mechanical and electrical parts, complex computer software and other sophisticated components, any of which can have defective or inferior parts or\ncontain defects, errors or failures. Complex computer software is particularly vulnerable to errors and failures, especially when first introduced.\nBecause our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, defects could result in a number of complications, some of which could be\nserious and could harm or kill patients. The adverse publicity resulting from any of these events could cause physicians or hospitals to review and potentially terminate their\nrelationships with us.\nWe may also be subject to professional liability for errors in the clinical support that we provide to clinicians in connection with our products or for a misunderstanding\nof, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide.\nThe medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability and professional liability claims. A product liability or\nprofessional liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. Although we maintain liability insurance that we believe\nis appropriate, this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations, and may not be adequate to protect us against any future liability claims. Additionally,\nwe may be unable to maintain our existing liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts. A liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual\noutcome, could result in:\n• decreased demand for our products;\n• injury to our reputation;\n• diversion of management’s attention;\n• significant costs of related litigation;\n• payment of substantial monetary awards by us;\n• product recalls or market withdrawals;\n• a change in the design, manufacturing process or the indications for which our marketed products may be used;\n• loss of revenue; and\n• an inability to commercialize product candidates.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters, power loss and other events beyond our control, which would adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nTo date, we do not have redundant facilities. We conduct many of our activities, including research and development, component processing, final assembly,\npackaging and distribution activities for most of our products, at our facility located in Southern California, which is a seismically active area that has experienced major\nearthquakes in the past, as well as other natural disasters, including wildfires. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facility, including obtaining business interruption\ninsurance. However, any future natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a wildfire, pandemics, or other unanticipated catastrophes, such as telecommunications failures,\ncyberattacks, or terrorist attacks, at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers and customers do business, could significantly disrupt our operations, and\ndelay or prevent product assembly and shipment during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our facility, which could be lengthy and result in significant expenses.\nFurthermore, the insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates\nand terms. In addition, our facility may be subject to shortages of electrical power, natural gas, water and other energy supplies. Any future shortage or conservation measure\ncould disrupt our operations and cause expense, thus adversely affecting our business and financial results.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). We are also subject to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”).\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial\n42\nTable of Contents\ncondition. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt certain rules and regulations relating to our public disclosures, corporate governance and executive compensation,\namong other things, and such rules and regulations require significant attention from management. Compliance with all of these laws, rules and regulations may from time to\ntime divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and management is\nrequired to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. To maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight is required. If we are not successful in maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, there could be inaccuracies or omissions in the consolidated financial information we are required to file with the SEC. Additionally,\neven if there are no inaccuracies or omissions, we will be required to publicly disclose the conclusion of our management that our internal control over financial reporting or\ndisclosure controls and procedures are not effective.\nThese events could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, adversely impact our stock price, result in increased costs to remediate any\ndeficiencies, or attract regulatory scrutiny or lawsuits that could be costly to resolve and distract management’s attention.\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and\ninvolve risks, assumptions and uncertainties. You should review the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and commercializes innovative platforms for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures in\nthe brain. We have deployed significant resources to fund our efforts to develop the foundational capabilities for enabling MRI-guided interventions, building an intellectual\nproperty portfolio, and identifying and building out commercial applications for the technologies developed by our company.\nThe first foundational part of our business is a medical device company providing medical devices for neurosurgery applications. Our primary medical device product,\nthe ClearPoint system, is an integrated system comprised of hardware components, disposable components, and intuitive, menu-driven software, which is in commercial use\nglobally. The primary applications for the ClearPoint system are to target and guide the insertion of deep brain stimulation electrodes, biopsy needles, and laser catheters, as\nwell as the infusion of pharmaceuticals into the brain. The ClearPoint system was originally designed for use in an MRI setting. In 2021, we launched the SmartFrame Array\nNeuro Navigation System and Software, which allows for operating room placement of the ClearPoint system, and in 2024, we commenced limited market release of the\nSmartFrame OR Stereotactic System, which allows for complete procedures to be performed\n45\nTable of Contents\nin the operating room. In 2022, we commercialized the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System as our first therapy product offering. We have exclusive global\ncommercialization rights to the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System through our Swedish partner, CLS.\nThe second part of our business is focused on partnerships in the biologics drug and delivery space. Our services include protocol consultation and solutions for\npreclinical study design and execution. Currently, we have more than 50 biologics and drug delivery customers who are evaluating using our products and services in trials to\ninject gene and cell therapies directly into the brain. These partnerships involve drug development programs that are at various stages of development ranging from preclinical\nresearch to late-stage regulatory trials for multiple distinct disease states. This part of our business potentially represents the largest opportunity for growth; however, our ability\nto grow in this market is dependent on our ability to maintain and establish new relationships with customers, such customers' continuation of research and development plans,\nand such customers achieving success in completion of clinical trials and subsequent regulatory approvals of their drugs and biologics.\n2023 Developments\n• We entered into multiple multi-year agreements with pharmaceutical partners to partner on drug delivery platforms for gene therapy, earning success-based milestones\nbased on the successful progression of a drug candidate through the clinical and regulatory process.\n• We further expanded our worldwide license and research agreement with Philips to add subnuclei segmentation applied to MRI, and potentially CT scans, for use in the\noperating room.\n• We signed an exclusive multi-year licensing agreement with UCSF to develop and commercialize a radially branching cellular delivery device for use in both the\noperating room under fluroscopy/CT guidance and under MRI guidance.\n• We received FDA clearance for ClearPoint Array Software 1.2 and ClearPoint Neuro Navigation Software 2.2.\n• As a result of increased investment in the biologics and drug delivery business to add new clinical, development, regulatory, and preclinical contract research\norganization services, we successfully completed multiple preclinical studies.\n• We exited our manufacturing site in Irvine, California, and are fully operational out of our new Carlsbad, California facility.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations\nThe following is a description of factors which may influence our future results of operations, and that we believe are important to an understanding of our business\nand results of operations.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nWe continue to monitor the impacts of various macroeconomic trends, such as global economic and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including\ninstability resulting from military conflicts), labor shortages, instability of financial institutions and inflationary conditions. Changes in domestic and global economic\nconditions, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which is likely to lead to increased costs and\nmay cause further changes in fiscal and monetary policy. Impacts from inflationary pressures, such as increasing costs for research and development of our products,\nadministrative and other costs of doing business, the potential for instability of the financial institutions where we maintain our deposits or other assets, and our access to capital\nmarkets and other sources of funding in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these trends could adversely\naffect our customers, which could impact their willingness to spend on our products and services, or their ability to make payments, which could harm our collection of accounts\nreceivable and financial results. The rapid development and fluidity of these situations precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact they will have on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operation and cash flows, which will depend largely on future developments.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\nIn 2010, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our ClearPoint system in the U.S. for general neurosurgical procedures; in February 2011 and May\n2018, we also obtained CE marking for our ClearPoint system and SmartFlow cannula, respectively; and in June 2020 we obtained CE marking for version 2.0 of our\nClearPoint software and our Inflexion head fixation frame. In January 2021, we received 510(k) clearance for the SmartFrame Array Neuro Navigation System. In September\n2022, the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, for which we have exclusive global right to commercialize, received 510(k) clearance through our Swedish partner,\nCLS. The Prism laser represents the first therapy product we have commercialized. In January 2024, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the SmartFrame OR\nStereotactic System.\nIn 2021, we started providing consulting services to our pharmaceutical and other medical technology customers for improving outcome predictability and optimizing\npreclinical and clinical workflows. Our expertise is concentrated in benchtop testing, preclinical studies, clinical trial support, regulatory consultation, and over-arching\ntranslation from the preclinical to the clinical setting to enhance accuracy and precision of drug delivery.\nFuture revenue from sales of our ClearPoint platform products and services is difficult to predict and may not be sufficient to offset our continuing research and\ndevelopment expenses and our increasing selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGenerating recurring revenue from the sale of products remains an important part of our business model for our ClearPoint system. Our product revenue was\napproximately $10.6 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was almost entirely related to our ClearPoint system. Our\nservice revenue was approximately $13.4 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which 86% and 70%, respectively, related\nto the biologics and drug delivery service line.\nOur revenue recognition policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nUnderlying the revenue from sales of products and services to our biologics and drug delivery customers is the number of direct customers and end users of our\nproducts and/or services (“Partners”). Our Partners consist of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic institutions, or customer-sponsored contract research\norganizations that are developing methods to deliver a wide variety of molecules, genes or proteins to targeted brain tissue or structures that would need to bypass the blood-\nbrain barrier for the treatment of a variety of disorders. This is a novel area in which commercialization must be preceded by FDA-mandated clinical trials, which are expensive\nand time consuming to conduct, and for which commercial success is uncertain, pending, in part, on the outcome of those trials. While our revenue from sales of products and\nservices to our biologics and drug delivery customers is indicative of growth, the number of Partner relationships is also of importance as we recognize the possibility that some\nPartners’ research will reach commercial success, and others may not. To the extent our Partners achieve commercial success, our expectation is that we will share in such\nsuccess through our Partners’ use of our products and services in their delivery of therapies. At December 31, 2023, we had more than 50 Partners, which is similar to the\nnumber of Partners as of the same date in 2022.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes the direct costs associated with the assembly and purchase of components for functional neurosurgery navigation products, biologics and drug\ndelivery products, non-neurosurgery therapy products, and ClearPoint capital equipment that we have sold, and for which we have recognized revenue in accordance with our\nrevenue recognition policy, as well as labor hours for the cost of providing preclinical, consulting, and service revenue. Cost of revenue also includes the allocation of\nmanufacturing overhead costs and depreciation of loaned systems installed under our ClearPoint placement program, as well as provisions for obsolete, impaired, or excess\ninventory.\nResearch and Development Costs\nOur research and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the conceptualization, design, testing, and prototyping of our ClearPoint system products\nand enhancements. Such costs include salaries, travel, and benefits for research and development personnel; materials and laboratory supplies in research and development\nactivities; outside consultant costs; and licensing costs related to technology not yet commercialized. We anticipate that, over time, our research and development costs may\nincrease as we: (i) develop devices and services for delivery of therapeutics into\n47\nTable of Contents\nthe central nervous system, (ii) expand products into the OR and therapeutics space, and (iii) expand the application of our technological platforms internationally.\nProduct development timelines, likelihood of success, and total costs can vary widely by product candidate. There are also risks inherent in the regulatory clearance and\napproval process. At this time, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in our efforts to expand the application of our technological platforms.\nSales and Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses\nOur sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, travel and benefits, including related\nshare-based compensation; marketing costs; professional fees, including fees for outside attorneys and accountants; occupancy costs; insurance; and other general and\nadministrative expenses, which include, but are not limited to, corporate licenses, director fees, hiring costs, taxes, postage, office supplies, information technology and meeting\ncosts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult and\nsubjective judgments are discussed below. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we\nbelieve that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when control of our products and services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive from our customers in exchange for those products and services, in a process that involves identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the\nperformance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing\nrevenue when or as the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require\nsignificant judgment. We evaluate each product or service promised in a contract to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. A performance obligation\nis considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available\nto the customer and is separately identified in the contract. When a contract calls for the satisfaction of multiple performance obligations for a single contract price, we typically\nallocate the contract price among the performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling prices for each such performance obligation customarily charged by us.\nWe consider a performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of a good or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and\nobtain the benefit of the good or service. Product revenue is generally recognized at a point in time, generally upon shipment, however, it may be recognized upon delivery\nbased on the contractual terms with certain customers. Service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method used to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the\nnature of the products or services to be provided. Depending on which better depicts the transfer of control to the customer, we may use output methods, such as time elapsed, or\ninput methods, such as labor hours expended or costs incurred, to measure our progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. We recognize revenue for\nsatisfied performance obligations only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control.\nUnder certain agreements, we are entitled to receive event-based payments subject to our customer's achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones.\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\n48\nTable of Contents\njudgment, it is probable that these milestones will be achieved and a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. At the end of each\nreporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones, and if necessary adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. The probability\nassessment is largely based on communications with our customers and historical, current, and forecasted information that is reasonably available. A revenue reversal is\npossible if it is determined that achievement of a milestone which was previously deemed probable, will not occur.\nInventory. Inventory is carried at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Items in inventory relate predominantly to our functional\nneurosurgical products, drug delivery and biologic products, therapy products and ClearPoint capital equipment. Software license inventory related to ClearPoint systems\nundergoing on-site customer evaluation is included in inventory in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All other software license inventory is classified as a non-\ncurrent asset. We periodically review our inventory for excess and obsolete items and provide a reserve upon giving consideration to factors such as its physical condition, sales\npatterns, and expected future demand in order to estimate the amount necessary to write down any slow moving, obsolete, or damaged inventory. These estimates could vary\nfrom actual amounts based upon future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the estimated write-\ndowns were made.\nShare-Based Compensation. We account for compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or other equity instruments\n(including options) based on fair value. The fair value of each award is estimated as of the grant date and amortized as compensation expense over the requisite vesting period.\nThe fair values of our share-based awards are estimated on the grant dates using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This valuation model requires the input of highly subjective\nassumptions, including the expected stock volatility, estimated award terms and risk-free interest rates for the expected terms. To estimate the expected terms, we utilize the\nsimplified method for “plain vanilla” options discussed in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, or SAB 107. We believe that all factors listed within SAB 107 as\nprerequisites for utilizing the simplified method apply to us and to our share-based compensation arrangements. We intend to utilize the simplified method for the foreseeable\nfuture until more detailed information about exercise behavior becomes available. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock. We utilize risk-free\ninterest rates based on U.S. treasury instruments, the term of which is consistent with the expected term of the share-based award. We have not paid, and do not anticipate\npaying, cash dividends on shares of our common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that\nthere will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to determine share-based compensation expense.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2023 to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, Percentage\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nProduct revenue $ 10,603 $ 12,789 (17) %\nService and other revenue 13,352 7,762 72 %\nTotal revenue 23,955 20,551 17 %\nCost of revenue 10,341 7,020 47 %\nGross profit 13,614 13,531 1 %\nResearch and development costs 11,709 10,894 7 %\nSales and marketing expenses 12,595 9,358 35 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 11,756 9,611 22 %\nOther income (expense):\nOther expense, net (29) (22) NM%\nInterest income (expense), net 386 (81) 577 %\nNet loss $ (22,089) $ (16,435) 34 %\nNM - The percentage change is not meaningful.\nRevenue.

This increase is attributable to a $6.0 million\nincrease in service revenue related to new preclinical studies and services entered into with our partners for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in\n2022, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in product revenue.\nFunctional neurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue, which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint\nsystem, decreased 7% to $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, from $9.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease is driven by lower service revenue\nof $0.6 million as a result of pausing a co-development program with one of our Brain Computer Interface partners for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the\nsame period in 2022.\nCapital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software and related services, decreased 21% to $1.8 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, from $2.3 million for the same period in 2022, due primarily to a decrease in the placements of ClearPoint capital and software.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue was $10.3 million, resulting in gross profit of $13.6 million and gross margin of 57%, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to $7.0 million, resulting in gross profit of $13.5 million and gross margin of 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease in gross\nmargin was primarily due to an increase in biologics and drug delivery preclinical services, which, to date, have had a lower margin than in prior years, as we launch new\nservices and increase our presence in this space. Increased costs related to the transition to the new manufacturing facility also contributed to the decrease in gross margin\ncompared to the prior year.\nResearch and Development Costs. Research and development costs were $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $10.9 million for the same\nperiod in 2022, an increase of $0.8 million, or 7%. The increase was due primarily to increases in personnel costs, including share-based compensation expense, of $1.2 million\ndue to growth in headcount, partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in research costs as a result of reprioritization of certain initiatives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9.4 million for the same period\nin 2022, an increase of $3.2 million, or 35%. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs, including share-based compensation expense, of $3.0 million\nresulting from increases in headcount in our clinical and marketing teams, and increases in travel expense of $0.2 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9.6 million for\nthe same period in 2022, an increase of $2.1 million, or 22%. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $1.4 million and increased\nshare-based compensation of $0.8 million.\n50\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.4 million, compared with $0.1 million in net interest expense for the same period in\n2022. The increase in interest income was due to higher interest rates and our investment in U.S. Government debt securities, offset partially by the higher amount of interest\npaid on the 2020 Secured Convertible Note, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Additional information with respect to the 2020\nSecured Convertible Note is in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception, which has resulted in a cumulative deficit at December 31, 2023 of approximately $172 million. In addition, our use\nof cash from operations amounted to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since inception, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity\nsecurities and the issuance of notes payable. In 2021, we completed a public offering of 2,127,660 shares of our common stock from which the net proceeds totaled\napproximately $46.8 million. In 2020, we issued secured convertible notes to two investors which raised gross proceeds of $25 million, of which $15 million has been\nconverted to common stock and $10 million remains outstanding.\nAdditional information with respect to the 2020 Secured Notes is in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAs a result of these transactions and our business operations, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, on March 4, 2024 we completed a public offering of\n2,307,694 shares of our common stock. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $14.0 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other\nestimated offering expenses payable by us.\nIn management’s opinion, based on our current forecasts for revenue, expense and cash flows, our existing cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2023,\nare sufficient to support our operations and meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months.\nWe may, in the future, offer and sell additional equity or issue additional notes payable to raise funds for working capital, capital expenditures, or other general\ncorporate purposes. Our primary uses of cash and operating expenses relate to paying employees and consultants, marketing our products, and supporting our research and\ndevelopment of future product offerings. Our short- and long-term liquidity requirements include the following obligations:\n• We have a $10 million secured convertible note payable due in January 2025. Future interest payments associated with the note are variable based on the greater of (i)\nthree (3)-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or (ii) 2%, plus a margin of 2%. At current interest rates, we expect the interest expense for the next 12\nmonths to be approximately $0.8 million.\n• We have lease arrangements related to our office and manufacturing facilities under non-cancellable operating leases. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n• We typically enter into short-term agreements with vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of business through purchase orders, which are\nsettled in cash upon delivery of such goods or services. We may also at times enter into long-term commitments or license and collaboration agreements which require\ncommitments that are noncancellable. The total amount as of December 31, 2023 for unfulfilled purchase orders and long-term purchase commitments is $3.0 million, of\nwhich approximately 40% is expected to be paid in 2024.\n51\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nCash activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is summarized as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCash used in operating activities $ (13,720) $ (16,167)\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities 8,949 (10,736)\nCash provided by financing activities 296 409\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,475) $ (26,494)\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $13.7 million, a decrease of $2.4\nmillion from the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease consisted of a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million, and a net increase in non-cash items\nof $4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in net loss of $5.7 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to lower inventory purchases in 2023,\nfollowing a ramping up of inventory stock in previous years in response to supply chain disruptions, which were partially offset by increased use of cash in 2023 to pay down\naccounts payables and accrued expenses. The change in the non-cash items results primarily from increases in share-based compensation and allowance for credit losses.\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash flows provided by investing activities in 2023 were $8.9 million and consisted of proceeds from the maturities of\nshort-term investments, partially offset by equipment acquisitions related to our new manufacturing site in Carlsbad, California, and acquisition of licensing rights.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2022 were $10.7 million and consisted primarily of the purchase and maturities of short-term investments and acquisition\nof equipment licensing rights.\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2023 consisted of proceeds of $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock\nunder the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments of $0.2 million for taxes related to shares withheld in connection with vesting of restricted stock awards.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2022 consisted of proceeds of $0.7 million from the exercise of common stock options and warrants and purchases made\nunder the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments of $0.3 million for taxes related to shares withheld in connection with vesting of restricted stock awards.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nTo date, we have not achieved profitability. We could continue to incur net losses as we continue our efforts to expand the commercialization of our products and\nservices and pursue additional applications for our technology platforms. Our cash balances are primarily held in a variety of demand accounts with a view to liquidity and\ncapital preservation.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of medical devices, we are unable to estimate the exact\namounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to successfully commercialize our products and pursue additional applications for our technology platforms.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• the ultimate duration and impact of macroeconomic trends, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including military\nconflicts), and instability of financial institutions;\n• the timing of broader market acceptance and adoption of our products;\n• the scope, rate of progress and cost of our ongoing product development activities relating to our products;\n• the ability of our Partners to achieve commercial success, including their use of our products and services in their preclinical studies, clinical trials and delivery of\ntherapies;\n• the cost and timing of expanding our sales, clinical support, marketing and distribution capabilities, and other corporate infrastructure;\n• the cost and timing of establishing inventories at levels sufficient to support our sales;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n52\nTable of Contents\n• the cost of pursuing additional applications of our technology platforms under current collaborative arrangements, and the terms and timing of any future\ncollaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n• the cost and timing of any clinical trials;\n• the cost and timing of regulatory filings, clearances and approvals; and\n• the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nITEM 7A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer by others within our organization. Under their supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, to ensure that the information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in\nthe reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent\nlimitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of\nchanges in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance that\nthe objectives of the internal control system are met.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that\nour internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s assessment was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only\nmanagement’s assessment in this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nEmphasis of Matter\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses since its inception which has resulted in a cumulative deficit as of December 31, 2023. Note 1 describes\nmanagement’s plans in regard to these matters, including the closing of an equity offering in March 2024, which raised approximately $14 million of net proceeds.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich it relates.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company had $23,955,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue is derived from (1) product revenue resulting from the sale of functional\nneurosurgery, navigation, therapy, and biologics and drug delivery disposable products; (2) product revenue resulting from the sale of ClearPoint capital equipment and\nsoftware; (3) consultation revenue and clinical case support revenue in connection with customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials; (4) license revenue for the granting of\nlicenses to develop and commercialize the Company's SmartFlow Cannula devices with our customers' proprietary biologics as a combination product; and (5) revenue resulting\nfrom the service, installation, training, and shipping related to ClearPoint capital equipment and software. As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany recognizes revenue when control of the Company’s products and services is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company\nexpects to receive from its customers in exchange for those products and services in a process that involves identifying the contract with the customer, determining the\nperformance obligation in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing\nrevenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nDue to the nature of the Company’s customer agreements, management exercises judgment in the following areas in determining appropriate revenue recognition:\na. Determination of which products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined;\nb. Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each performance obligation;\nc. Estimation of contract price and allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations;\nd. The pattern and timing of delivery for each distinct performance obligation; and\ne. The identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\nAs a result, a degree of auditor judgment was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s judgments. Changes in these judgments\ncan have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nBased on our knowledge of the Company, we determined the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue as discussed above, including the determination of\nthe revenue streams over which those procedures were performed. Our audit procedures included the following for service and other revenue:\na. Obtained an understanding of the internal controls and processes in place over the Company’s revenue recognition processes;\nb. Analyzed the significant assumptions and estimates made by management as discussed above; and\na. Assessed the recorded revenue by selecting a sample of transactions, analyzing the related contract, testing management’s identification of distinct performance\nobligations, and comparing the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation.\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditors since 2008.\nTampa, Florida\nMarch 12, 2024\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nCLEARPOINT NEURO, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Dollars in thousands, except for share and per share data)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 23,140 $ 27,615\nShort-term investments — 9,874\nAccounts receivable, net 3,211 2,665\nInventory, net 7,911 9,303\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,910 1,723\nTotal current assets 36,172 51,180\nProperty and equipment, net 1,389 806\nOperating lease rights of use 3,564 1,895\nSoftware license inventory 386 450\nLicensing rights 1,041 1,028\nOther assets 109 131\nTotal assets $ 42,661 $ 55,490\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 393 $ 272\nAccrued compensation 2,947 2,824\nOther accrued liabilities 1,053 2,065\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion 424 561\nDeferred product and service revenue, current portion 2,613 1,066\nTotal current liabilities 7,430 6,788\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion 3,568 1,532\nDeferred product and service revenue, net of current portion 541 390\n2020 senior secured convertible note payable, net 9,949 9,893\nTotal liabilities 21,488 18,603\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 8)\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value;

Description of the Business and Financial Condition\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (the “Company”) is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative platforms for\nperforming minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain. From the Company’s inception in 1998, the Company deployed significant resources to fund its efforts to\ndevelop the foundational capabilities for enabling MRI-guided interventions, building an intellectual property portfolio, and identifying and building out commercial\napplications for the technologies it develops. In 2021, the Company’s efforts expanded beyond the MRI suite to encompass development and commercialization of new\nneurosurgical device products for the operating room setting, as well as consulting services for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic institutions, and contract\nresearch organizations. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 1998, and has headquarters located in Solana Beach, California. The Company\nestablished ClearPoint Neuro (Canada) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Canada, in August 2013, primarily for the purpose of performing software\ndevelopment, and established ClearPoint Neuro U.K. Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in the United Kingdom, in October 2020, ClearPoint Neuro Germany\nGmbH., a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Germany, in May 2023, and ClearPoint Neuro Italy, S.r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Italy, in August\n2023, primarily for the purpose of employing the Company’s clinical services representatives serving the Company’s customers in the United Kingdom and the EU. The\nactivities of all subsidiaries are reflected in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s initial product offering, the ClearPoint system, is an integrated system comprised of capital equipment and disposable products, designed to allow minimally\ninvasive procedures in the brain to be performed in an MRI suite. The ClearPoint Array Neuro Navigation System and its principal disposable component, introduced in\n2021, is designed to be deployed in an operating room setting while also being usable in an MRI suite. Both systems provide guidance for the placement and operation of\ninstruments or devices during the planning and operation of neurosurgical procedures. The Company received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”) in 2010 to market the ClearPoint system in the United States for general neurosurgical interventional procedures; in February 2011, the Company also obtained CE\nmarking for its ClearPoint system. In 2011 and 2018, the Company received 510(k) clearance and CE marking, respectively, for its SmartFlow cannula which is being used,\nor is under evaluation, along with the Company's services, by more than 50 pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic institutions, or contract research organizations\nhaving a focus on biologics and drug delivery. In September 2022, the ClearPoint Prism Neuro Laser Therapy System, for which the Company has exclusive global\ncommercialization rights, received 510(k) clearance through the Company’s Swedish partner CLS. The Prism laser represents the Company's first therapy product offering.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nThe Company continues to monitor the impact of various macroeconomic trends, such as global economic and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability (including\ninstability resulting from military conflicts), labor shortages, instability of financial institutions and inflationary conditions. Changes in domestic and global economic\nconditions, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which is likely to lead to increased costs\nand may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy. Impacts from inflationary pressures, such an increasing costs for research and development of the Company's products,\nadministrative and other costs of doing business, the potential for instability for the financial institutions where the Company maintains its deposits or other assets, and the\nCompany's access to capital markets and other source of funding in the future could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, these trends could adversely affect the Company's customers, which could impact their willingness to spend on the Company's products and services, or their\nability to make payment, which could harm the Company's collection of accounts receivable and financial results. The rapid development and fluidity of these situations\nprecludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact they will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, which will depend\nlargely on future developments.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred net losses since its inception which has resulted in a cumulative deficit at December 31, 2023 of approximately $172 million. In addition, the\nCompany’s use of cash from operations amounted to $13.7\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since inception, the Company has financed its operations principally from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of\nnotes payable.\nIn 2021, the Company completed a public offering of 2,127,660 shares of its common stock from which the net proceeds totaled approximately $46.8 million. In 2020,\npursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), the Company issued secured convertible notes to two investors which raised gross proceeds of $25\nmillion, of which $15 million has been converted to common stock and $10 million remains outstanding (the \"Outstanding First Closing Note\"). Additional information with\nrespect to these notes is found in Note 7.\nAs discussed in Note 11, on March 4, 2024 the Company completed a public offering of2 ,307,694 shares of its common stock. Net proceeds from the offering were\napproximately $14.0 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\nAs required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the Company has evaluated its ability to continue as a going concern and has\ndetermined that based on current forecasts, existing cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2023 are sufficient to support the Company’s operations and meet its\nobligations for at least the next twelve months.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. As of December 31, 2023, cash\nequivalents consisted of U.S. Government debt securities.\nShort-term investments\nShort-term investments are investments with original maturities greater than three months but less than twelve months from the date of purchase, and consist of U.S.\nGovernment debt securities. The Company classifies the short-term investments as held-to-maturity in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Section\n320, \"Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\" Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity and are\nrecorded at amortized cost on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, adjusted for the accretion of discounts using the effective interest method.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Items in inventory relate predominantly to the Company’s ClearPoint system.\nSoftware license inventory related to ClearPoint systems undergoing on-site customer evaluation is included in inventory in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAll other software license inventory is classified as a non-current asset. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for obsolete items and provides a reserve upon\nidentification of potential obsolete items.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company is a party to a license agreement which provides rights to the Company for the development and commercialization of products. Under the term of the license\nagreement, the Company paid an aggregate $1.1 million\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nto the licensor upon execution of the license agreement for access to the underlying technology and will make future payments based on the achievement of regulatory and\ncommercialization milestones as defined in the license agreement. In 2022, the Company made a payment of $0.6 million to the licensor for the achievement of a regulatory\nmilestone, which acts as a prepayment for future royalties.\nIn conformity with ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” the Company amortizes its investment in the upfront license rights described above over an expected\nuseful life of up to five years, or as commercial sales occur for the royalty prepayment. In addition, the Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its investment in\nthe license rights and records an impairment charge in the event such evaluation indicates that the Company's investment is not likely to be recovered.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, principallyt hree to seven years. Leasehold\nimprovements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets (finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment). Whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the expected undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the net book value\nof the related assets. If the net book value of the related assets were to exceed the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the assets, the carrying amount would be\nreduced to the present value of the expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue is comprised primarily of: (1) product revenue resulting from the sale of functional neurosurgery, navigation, therapy, and biologics and drug\ndelivery disposable products; (2) product revenue resulting from the sale of ClearPoint capital equipment and software; (3) consultation revenue and clinical case support\nrevenue in connection with customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials; (4) license revenue for the granting of licenses to develop and commercialize the Company's\nSmartFlow Cannula devices with the Company's customers' proprietary biologics as a combination product, and (5) revenue resulting from the service, installation, training,\nand shipping related to ClearPoint capital equipment and software. The Company recognizes revenue when (i) control of the Company’s products is transferred to its\ncustomers or (ii) services are provided to customers, each in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive from its customers in exchange for\nthose products and services, in a process that involves identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the\ntransaction price, allocating the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligations have\nbeen satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together\nwith other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. When a contract calls for the satisfaction of multiple performance\nobligations for a single contract price, the Company typically allocates the contract price among the performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling prices\nfor each such performance obligation customarily charged by the Company. The Company considers a performance obligation satisfied once it has transferred control of a\ngood or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the good or service. The Company recognizes revenue for satisfied\nperformance obligations only when it determines there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control.\nLines of Business; Timing of Revenue Recognition\n• Functional neurosurgery navigation product, biologics and drug delivery systems product, and therapy product sales: Revenue from the sale of functional\nneurosurgery navigation products (consisting of disposable products sold commercially and related to cases utilizing the Company's ClearPoint system), biologics\nand drug delivery systems (consisting primarily of disposable products related to customer-sponsored clinical trials utilizing the ClearPoint system), and therapy\nproducts (consisting primarily of disposable laser-related products used in neurosurgical and non-neurosurgical procedures) is generally based\nF-11\nTable of Contents\non customer purchase orders, the predominance of which require delivery within one week of the order having been placed, and are generally recognized at the\npoint in time of shipping to the customer, which is the point at which legal title, and risks and rewards of ownership, transfer to the customer. For certain customers,\nlegal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer upon delivery to the customer as stated in their respective contracts, in which case revenue is recognized upon\ndelivery.\n• Capital equipment and software sales:\n◦ Capital equipment and software sales preceded by evaluation periods: The predominance of capital equipment and software sales (consisting of integrated\ncomputer hardware and software that are integral components of the Company's ClearPoint system) are preceded by customer evaluation periods. During\nthese evaluation periods, installation of, and training of customer personnel on, the systems have been completed and the systems have been in operation.\nAccordingly, revenue from capital equipment and software sales following such evaluation periods is recognized at the point in time that the Company is in\nreceipt of an executed purchase agreement or purchase order.\n◦ Capital equipment and software sales not preceded by evaluation periods: Revenue from sales of capital equipment and software not having been\npreceded by an evaluation period is recognized upon delivery to the customer and installation. For capital equipment that does not require installation,\nrevenue is recognized upon shipment, however, for those customers where legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer upon delivery, revenue is\nrecognized at such time.\nFor both types of capital equipment and software sales described above, the determination of the point in time at which to recognize revenue represents that point at\nwhich the customer has legal title, physical possession, and the risks and rewards of ownership, and the Company has a present right to payment.\n• Functional neurosurgery navigation and therapy services: The Company recognizes revenue for such services over time as the services are delivered to the\ncustomer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation.\n• Biologics and drug delivery services and other revenue:\n◦ Consultation Services: The Company recognizes consultation revenue over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company may use output methods, such as time elapsed, or input methods, such as labor\nhours expended or costs incurred, to measure progress depending on which better depicts the transfer of control to the customer.\n◦ Clinical Service Access Fees: For contracts in which the Company receives a periodic fixed fee, irrespective of the number of cases attended by the\nCompany's personnel during such periods, revenue is recognized ratably over the period covered by such fees. A time-elapsed output method is used for\nsuch fees because the Company transfers control evenly by providing a stand-ready service.\n◦ Clinical Service Procedure-Based Fees: The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time a case is attended by Company personnel.\n◦ License fees: License fees represent the use of functional intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted and does not\nrequire any significant development or customization. Accordingly, the Company recognizes license revenue at the point in time in which the license\nbecomes effective and the intellectual property is made available to the customer.\n◦ Milestone fees: Event-based payments which are subject to the customer's achievement of specified development or regulatory milestones are included in\nthe transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that these milestones will be achieved and a significant future reversal of cumulative\nrevenue under the contract will not occur. The Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such milestone at the end of each reporting period\nand adjusts the transaction price as necessary.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\n• Capital equipment-related services:\n◦ Equipment service: Revenue from service of ClearPoint capital equipment and software previously sold to customers is based on agreements with terms\nranging from one to three years and is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the service agreement. A time-elapsed output method is used\nfor service revenue because the Company transfers control evenly by providing a stand-ready service.\nThe Company may also enter into contracts with customers who own ClearPoint capital equipment, which bundle maintenance and support services and\naccess to software and hardware upgrades made commercially available over the term of the contract, for a single contract price, typically paid on an\nannual basis. The Company allocates the contract price among the performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone prices for each such\nperformance obligation and recognizes the revenue ratably on a monthly basis. A time-elapsed output method is used as the Company is providing a stand-\nready service for each of the performance obligations.\n◦ Installation, training, and shipping: Consistent with the Company's recognition of revenue for capital equipment and software sales as described above,\nfees for installation, training, and shipping in connection with sales of capital equipment and software that have been preceded by customer evaluation\nperiods are recognized as revenue at the point in time the Company is in receipt of an executed purchase order for the equipment and software. Installation,\ntraining, and shipping fees related to capital equipment and software sales not having been preceded by an evaluation period are recognized as revenue\nconcurrent with the recognition of revenue of the related capital equipment.\nThe Company operates in one industry segment, and the predominance of its sales are to U.S.-based customers.\nPayment terms under contracts with customers generally are in a range of 30-60 days after the customers’ receipt of the Company’s invoices.\nThe Company's terms and conditions do not provide for a right of return unless for: (a) product defects; or (b) other conditions subject to the Company's approval.\nSee Note 3 for additional information regarding revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts related to research, design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Such assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income or loss in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period\nthat includes the enactment date. The Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets unless, based upon available evidence, it is more likely\nthan not the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the\nsame because the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock equivalents, which comprise the entire amount of the Company’s outstanding common\nstock options and unvested RSUs as described in Note 9, and the potential conversion of the First Closing Note, as described in Note 7, would be anti-dilutive, due to the\nreporting of a net loss for each of the periods in the accompanying\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 4 million and 3 million shares, respectively, of common stock\nequivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because their effect was anti-dilutive.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for compensation for all arrangements under which employees, directors and others receive shares of stock or other equity instruments (i.e. options)\nbased on fair value. The fair value of each award is estimated as of the grant date and amortized as compensation expense over the requisite vesting period. Forfeitures are\nrecognized as they occur. The fair values of the Company’s share-based awards are estimated on the grant dates using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This valuation\nmodel requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock volatility, estimated award terms and risk-free interest rates for the expected terms. To\nestimate the expected terms, the Company utilizes the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options discussed in the Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (“SAB 107”) issued by the\nSEC. The Company believes that all factors listed within SAB 107 as pre-requisites for utilizing the simplified method apply to the Company and its share-based\ncompensation arrangements. The Company intends to utilize the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior\nbecomes available. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company utilizes risk-free interest rates based on U.S. treasury\ninstruments, the terms of which are consistent with the expected terms of the equity awards. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its\nshares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.\nFair Value Determination of Share-Based Transactions\nThe Company’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CLPT.” Quoted closing stock prices are used as a key input in determining the fair\nvalue for share-based transactions.\nConcentration Risks and Other Risks and Uncertainties\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.\nThe Company holds substantially all its cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions in the U.S. that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or in U.S. government debt securities. At December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $1.4 million in bank balances that were in excess of the insured\nlimits.\nAt December 31, 2023, there were four customers whose accounts receivable balances represented 28%, 26%, 16%, and 10% of accounts receivable at that date. At\nDecember 31, 2022, one customer accounted for 19% of accounts receivable at that date.\nOne pharmaceutical customer, a related party who is a stockholder, a noteholder, and whose chief executive officer is a representative on the Company's Board of Directors\n(see Note 7), for whom the Company provides hardware, software, clinical services, and market development services in support of the customer's clinical trials, and from\nwhom the Company earns a quarterly fee, accounted for 12% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, and of 15% total revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. There were no outstanding receivables from this customer at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nPrior to granting credit, the Company generally performs credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition. In general, the Company does not require collateral from\ncustomers with an extension of credit. The accounts receivable balance is reduced by an allowance for credit losses from the potential inability of the Company's customer to\nmake required payments. The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Company evaluates the historic\nloss experience on the accounts receivable balance and also considers separately customers with receivable balances that may be negatively impacted by current economic\ndevelopments and market conditions. The estimate is a result of the Company's ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit\nlosses and future expectations.\nThe Company is subject to risks common to emerging companies in the medical device industry, including, but not limited to: new technological innovations; acceptance and\ncompetitiveness of its products; dependence on key personnel; dependence on key suppliers; dependence on third-party collaboration, license and joint development\nF-14\nTable of Contents\npartners; changes in general economic conditions and interest rates; protection of proprietary technology; compliance with changing government regulations; uncertainty of\nwidespread market acceptance of products; access to credit for capital purchases by customers; and product liability claims. Certain components used in manufacturing have\nrelatively few alternative sources of supply and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly. The inability of any of\nthese suppliers to fulfill the Company’s supply requirements may negatively impact future operating results.\nRecent Accounting Standards Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" which replaces the previous incurred\nloss impairment methodology for most financial assets with the current expected credit loss, or CECL, methodology. The new guidance requires entities to use a forward-\nlooking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The\nCompany adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2023, which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The amendments improve\nreportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim\ndisclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for\nentities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for calendar year-end public business entities in the 2024\nannual period and in 2025 for interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2023-07 for the 2024 annual period and 2025 interim periods,\nretrospectively, and is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\" which requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income\ntax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The provisions of the ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness\nof income tax disclosures. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively and is effective for calendar year-end\npublic business entities in the 2025 annual period and in 2026 for interim periods with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU\non its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nRevenue by Service Line\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nBiologics and drug delivery\nDisposable products $ 2,154 $ 3,690\nServices and license fees 11,448 5,430\nSubtotal – Biologics and drug delivery revenue 13,602 9,120\nFunctional neurosurgery navigation and therapy\nDisposable products 7,589 7,587\nServices 931 1,537\nSubtotal – Functional neurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue 8,520 9,124\nCapital equipment and software\nSystems and software products 860 1,512\nServices 973 795\nSubtotal – Capital equipment and software revenue 1,833 2,307\nTotal revenue $ 23,955 $ 20,551\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nContract Balances\n• Contract assets – The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to the Company's customers. In most cases, customers are billed upon\nshipment of such products or delivery of such services and the related contract assets, which represent an unconditional right to consideration, and comprise the\naccounts receivable balance. When revenue is recognized in advance of its right to bill and receive consideration, the Company records this unbilled receivable as a\ncontract asset, which is classified as other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, at December 31, 2022 the Company had\ndeferred contract costs related to up-front costs for direct materials incurred to fulfill a customer contract. These costs were classified as other current assets and\nwere recognized as expense in 2023.\n(in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAccounts receivable, net $ 3,211 $ 2,665\nOther contract assets\nUnbilled receivables $ 733 $ 43\nDeferred contract costs $ — $ 327\n• Contract liabilities – Contract liabilities consist of amounts that have been invoiced and for which the Company has the right to bill, but that have not been\nrecognized as revenue as the related goods or services have not been transferred. The Company's contract liabilities are generally comprised of the following (1)\ncapital equipment and software-related service fees that are typically billed and collected at the inception of the service agreements, which have terms ranging from\none to three years; (2) annual fees for agreements with customers that bundle the capital equipment and software-related service fees with software and hardware\nupgrades that are made commercially available over the term of the contract; and (3) up-front payments from customers made in connection with consulting\nservices. The unearned portion of all such fees is classified as deferred revenue. At December 31, 2022, the Company also had a $0.5 million refund liability\nresulting from an up-front customer payment which was potentially refundable if the parties did not enter into the ensuing agreement. In 2023, the uncertainties\nunderlying this amount were resolved and the amount was recognized as revenue.\n(in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDeferred revenues $ 3,154 $ 1,457\nRefund Liability $ — $ 500\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized capital equipment and software-related service revenue of approximately $1.1 million and\n$0.5 million, respectively, which was previously included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue that will\nbe recognized as revenue in future periods. The majority of the remaining performance obligations relate to capital equipment and software-related service agreements and the\nupfront payments discussed under the heading “Contract Balances” above, which amounted to approximately $2.9 million at December 31, 2023. The Company expects to\nrecognize approximately 80% of this revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.\n4. Fair Value Measurement\nFair value measurements are based on a three-tier hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs\nsuch as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nindirectly; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents of $23.1 million and $27.6 million as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, is derived using Level 1\ninputs. The cash equivalents are comprised of short-term bank deposits, money market funds, and U.S. Government debt securities with original maturities of three months or\nless, and the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had $9.9 million of short-term investments, consisting of twelve-month U.S. Government debt securities, which were classified as held\nto maturity and carried at amortized cost, adjusted for the accretion of discounts using the effective interest method. The carrying value of the debt securities approximates fair\nvalue based on Level 1 inputs. The Company held the investments to maturity, which occurred in 2023.\n5. Inventory\nInventory consists of the following as of December 31:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nRaw materials and work in process $ 6,466 $ 6,513\nSoftware licenses 211 210\nFinished goods 1,234 2,580\nInventory included in current assets 7,911 9,303\nSoftware licenses – non-current 386 450\n$ 8,297 $ 9,753\nInventory balances are presented net of an excess and obsolete reserve totaling $2.0 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n6. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following as of December 31:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nEquipment $ 1,108 $ 1,511\nFurniture and fixtures — 112\nLeasehold improvements 485 201\nComputer equipment and software — 150\nLoaned systems 741 601\n2,334 2,575\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (945) (1,769)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 1,389 $ 806\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.2 million and $0.1 million,\nrespectively. Loaned systems are ClearPoint systems that are in operation at customer sites on an evaluation basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, as part of the transition to the new manufacturing facility, the Company disposed of certain fully depreciated property and\nequipment no longer in use.\n7. Note Payable\nIn January 2020, the Company completed a financing transaction with two investors (the “2020 Convertible Noteholders”) whereby the Company issued an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $17.5 million of the First Closing Notes pursuant to the SPA, which, unless earlier converted or redeemed, mature on the fifth anniversary of the issuance\nand\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nbear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the three (3)-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and (b) two percent2 ()%, plus (ii) a margin of\n2% on the outstanding balance of the First Closing Notes, payable quarterly on the first business day of each calendar quarter. The First Closing Notes may be converted at a\nprice of $6.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the SPA and note agreement, and may not be pre-paid without the consent of the noteholder.\nIn May 2021, one of the 2020 Convertible Noteholders (the \"Converting Noteholder\") converted the entire $7.5 million principal amount of such Converting Noteholder's\nFirst Closing Note, and related accrued interest, amounting to approximately $0.04 million, into 1,256,143 shares of the Company's common stock.\nIn December 2020, the Company issued the Second Closing Notes to one of the 2020 Convertible Noteholders in an aggregate principal amount of $7.5 million. In\nNovember 2021, the holder of the Second Closing Note converted the entire principal amount of such note, along with related accrued and payment in-kind interest\naggregating $0.3 million, into 773,446 shares of the Company's common stock.\nAt December 31, 2023, the amount outstanding under the First Closing Notes is an aggregate principal amount of $10 million.

Commitments\nOperating Leases\nThe Company subleases office space in Solana Beach, California that serves as its corporate headquarters and houses certain management and personnel. The sublease term\ncommenced on December 15, 2020, is set to expire on December 31, 2026, and is renewable for an additional five-year period, at the Company’s option, provided that the\nCompany’s landlord has entered into an extension of its prime lease for the office space that encompasses the Company’s office space for at least five years.\nThe Company also leases space in Carlsbad, California, that houses office space and a manufacturing facility under a lease that commenced on June 1, 2023 and ends on\nMay 31, 2033. The Company has two options to extend the lease term for thirty-six or sixty months, at the fair market rental value. Upon establishment of the new\nmanufacturing facility in Carlsbad, the Company terminated its prior manufacturing facility lease in Irvine, California, effective October 2023. The lease termination did not\nhave a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nThe optional renewal periods for both leases are not considered in the determination of the right-of-use asset or the lease liability as the Company does not consider it\nreasonably certain that it would exercise either of such options. The lease arrangements contain lease components and non-lease components which are accounted for as a\nsingle lease component as the Company has elected the practical expedient to group lease and non-lease components for all leases.\nOperating lease liabilities are based on the net present value of the remaining lease payments over the remaining lease term. In determining the present value of lease\npayments, the Company used the published U.S. High Yield CCC corporate bond rates at the lease commencement date of the Solana Beach lease and the current estimate of\nthe Company's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date of the Carlsbad lease. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term of\nthe Company's operating leases was 7.38 years and the weighted average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability was1 1.8%.\nThe lease cost, included in general and administrative expense, was $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, future minimum lease payments are as follows:\nYears ending December 31, (in thousands)\n2024 $ 869\n2025 954\n2026 985\n2027 502\n2028 520\nThereafter 2,519\nTotal minimum payments 6,349\nLess: Discount to present value of lease payments (2,357)\nDiscounted present value of lease payments $ 3,992\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company is a party to various purchase arrangements related to our manufacturing and research and development activities. At December 31, 2023 there was\napproximately $0.9 million of open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, the majority of which are due withino ne year.\nAdditionally, the Company is also a party to license and collaboration agreements which require minimum purchase commitments for a five-year period starting in 2022. The\ntotal remaining minimum purchase commitment related to these agreements is $2.1 million over the next four years.\n9.

RSAs are grants that entitle the holder to acquire shares of the Company's\ncommon stock at zero cost. The shares covered by a RSA cannot be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of until the award vests. A RSU is a promise\nby the Company to issue a share of its common stock upon vesting of the unit. Both RSAs and RSUs vest in annual installments over a two to three-year period, contingent\non the holder's continued employment with the Company. Annual grants of restricted stock to the Board of Directors typically vest in one year.\nRSA activity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is summarized below:\nWeighted - Average\nRestricted Stock Grant\nAwards Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 684,389 $ 11.10\nVested (298,480) $ 9.92\nForfeited or expired (8,995) $ 12.17\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 376,914 $ 12.02\nRSU activity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is summarized below:\nWeighted - Average\nGrant\nRestricted Stock Units Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 13,146 $ 11.41\nGranted 773,526 $ 8.08\nVested (18,533) $ 7.76\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 768,139 $ 8.15\nThe estimated fair value of the restricted stock is based on the closing market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\"). A total of 400,000 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock are available for issuance pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. The ESPP provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of common\nstock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value on either the first day or the last day of the applicable offering period, by having withheld from their salary an amount up to\n15% of their compensation. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of common stock (calculated at the time the purchase right is granted) in any\nF-22\nTable of Contents\ncalendar year, nor may any employee purchase more than 3,500 shares in any six-month purchase period. The initial six-month purchase period commenced in July 2021.\nThe ESPP is deemed to be compensatory, and therefore, ESPP expense has been included in share-based compensation expenses in the consolidated statement of operations\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, 84,430 shares were purchased at an average per share price of $6.00. On December 31, 2023, 236,091 shares of common stock\nwere available for issuance under the ESPP.\nThe fair value of the purchase options under the ESPP are estimated at the beginning of the purchase period using the Black-Scholes valuation model utilizing the following\nassumptions:\n2023 2022\nRisk-free interest rate 4.77% - 5.53% 0.22% - 2.25%\nExpected life (in years) 0.5 0.5\nEstimated volatility 61.41% - 62.37% 61.29% - 78.23%\nExpected dividends None None\nThe weighted-average fair value per ESPP purchase right during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2.57 per share and $4.14 per share, respectively.\nWarrants\nWarrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock were issued in connection with financing transactions in 2015 and 2017. These warrants contained net exercise\nprovisions giving the holder the option of acquiring a number of shares having a value equal to the difference between the exercise price and the current stock price, in lieu of\npaying the exercise price to acquire the full number of stated shares. All of the remaining outstanding warrants expired in 2023.\nCommon stock warrant activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nWeighted - Average\nExercise\nShares Price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 36,554 $ 16.23\nExpired (36,554) $ 16.23\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 — $ —\n10. Income Taxes\nThe Company had no income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of its deferred income tax assets\nin future periods, the Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets. If it is determined in the future that it is more likely than\nnot that any deferred income tax assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced by the estimated net realizable amounts.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 (1)\nIncome tax benefit at federal statutory rate $ (4,584) $ (3,472)\nAdjustments for tax effects of:\nState income tax, net of federal benefit (1,191) (913)\nPermanent adjustments 49 17\nBenefit state rate change (23) 646\nOther 152 877\nShare-based compensation 520 111\nNet operating loss write-off (574) 1,903\nChange in valuation allowance 5,659 831\nIncome tax expense $ 8 $ —\n(1) The 2022 amounts presented in the table above have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.\nThe tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of the deferred income tax assets are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred income tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 30,145 $ 26,574\nShare-based compensation 2,193 1,591\nAccrued expenses 319 349\n174 Capitalization 3,026 1,584\nOther 170 97\n35,853 30,195\nLess valuation allowance (35,815) (30,156)\nTotal deferred income tax assets 38 39\nDeferred tax liability - depreciation (38) (39)\nNet deferred tax assets $ — $ —\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. Generally, the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary\ndifferences become deductible. Based on all relevant factors, a valuation allowance of $35.8 million has been established against deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023\nas management determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to realize those temporary differences.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $120 million and $72 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any,\nfor federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforward began expiring in 2023, and the state net operating loss carryforward\nbegins expiring in 2028. It is possible that the Company will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration. In\naddition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (as defined in the Code), the\ncorporation’s ability to use its pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative\nchange in a “loss corporation’s” (as defined in the Code) ownership by 5% shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.\nManagement has evaluated the effect of guidance provided by GAAP regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and determined the Company has no uncertain tax\npositions that could have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company’s federal income tax return for 2020 and subsequent years remain open\nfor examination.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\n11. Subsequent Event\nOn March 4, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 2,307,694 shares of our common stock offered at a public price of $6.50 per share. Pursuant to the\nUnderwriting Agreement, the Company granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 346,154 shares of common stock at the public offering price,\nless any underwriting discounts and commissions, for use solely in covering any over-allotments.\nNet proceeds from the offering totaled approximately $14.0 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses\npayable by the Company.\nThe underwriting agreement contains representations, warranties, agreements and indemnification obligations by the Company that are customary for this type of transaction.\nF-25\nEXHIBIT 4.4\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES\nREGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (“ClearPoint,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”): our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”).\nAuthorized Shares of Capital Stock\nClearPoint’s authorized capital stock consists of 115,000,000 shares, consisting of 90,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par\nvalue $.01 per share (“Preferred Stock”).\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following description of Common Stock is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms and provisions contained in our Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended from time\nto time (the “Bylaws”), each of which is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.[7] is a part and incorporated by reference herein. We\nencourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), for additional\ninformation.\nDividends\nSubject to preferential rights that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably those dividends,\nif any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds.\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of our Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Under\nour Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. Because of this, the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock\nentitled to vote in any election of directors can elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose.\nLiquidation Rights\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any liquidation preference\ngranted to the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution\nto stockholders.\nFully Paid and Nonassessable\nThe outstanding shares of our Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.\nAbsence of Other Rights\nHolders of Common Stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common\nStock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of Common Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series\nof preferred stock that we may designate in the future.\nListing\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CLPT.”\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK\nUnder our Certificate of Incorporation, we have 25,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share. Our board of directors has the authority,\nwithout further action by the stockholders, to issue up to that number of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be\nincluded in each such series, to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon,\nand to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. The board of directors may\nauthorize the issuance of Preferred Stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The\nissuance of Preferred Stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the ClearPoint and may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and the voting and other rights of the\nholders of our Common Stock. As of the date hereof, we have no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.\nCERTAIN MATTERS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a publicly\nheld Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such person or entity\nbecame an interested stockholder, unless:\n• prior to such date, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming\nan interested stockholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the\nvoting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding specified shares; or\n• at or subsequent to such date of the transaction that resulted in a person or entity becoming an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by the\nboard of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the\noutstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe application of Section 203 may limit the ability of stockholders to approve a transaction that they may deem to be in their best interests. In addition, Section 203\nmakes it more difficult for an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period, although the stockholders may, by\nadopting an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, elect not to be governed by this section, effective 12 months after adoption.\nIn general, Section 203 defines “business combination” as:\n• any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder;\n• any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation to or with the interested stockholder;\n• subject to certain exceptions, any transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder;\n• any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially\nowned by the interested stockholder; or\n• the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation.\nIn general, Section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any person that is:\n• the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation;\n• an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within three years\nimmediately prior to the relevant date; or\n• an affiliate or associate of the above.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws do not exclude us from the restrictions imposed under Section 203. We anticipate that the provisions of Section 203 may\nencourage companies interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if a majority\nof the directors then in office approve either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws:\n• permits our board of directors to issue shares of Preferred Stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve an\nacquisition or other change in our control;\n• provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n• provides that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n• requires that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written\nconsent;\n• provides that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of\nstockholders must provide notice in writing to our Secretary in a timely manner, not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the\nimmediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders, provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or delayed more than\n30 days after such anniversary date, no proxy statement was delivered in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting, or there was no annual meeting in the\npreceding year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be given, not earlier than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of\nbusiness on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual\nmeeting was first made. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice for nominations to be made at a special meeting must be made not earlier than the 120th day prior to\nsuch special meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to such special meeting or, if later, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the\ndate of such special meeting was first made. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice;\n• does not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors\nto elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose);\n• provides that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, our chief executive officer or by the board of\ndirectors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and\n• provides that stockholders will be permitted to amend our Bylaws only upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding\nshares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nThese and other provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could delay or discourage some types of transactions involving an actual or\npotential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current\nprices, and may limit the ability of stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that stockholders may deem to be in their best interests and, therefore,\ncould adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\n\nClearPoint Neuro, Inc.

Questions regarding the Policy should be directed\n\n2 Actions taken by the Company, the General Counsel, or any other Company personnel do not constitute legal advice, nor do they insulate you from the consequences of noncompliance witht his Policy. II. Statement of Policies Prohibiting Insider Trading No officer, director, or employee (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy) shall purchase or sell any type of security while in possession of material nonpublic information relating to the security or the issuer of such security, whether the issuer of such security is the Company or any other company.A dditionally, no officer, director or employee shall purchase or sell any security of theC ompany during the period beginning at market close on the 15th day of the third month of the fiscal quarter of the Company and ending upon completion of the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter or during any othbeerin tgrpa rdeicnlge asruesdp einn saidovna pnecrei opdud resculaanret dto b tyh itsh eP oCloicmyp. aFnoyr .m Tohree sine fporromhaibtiiotino nabs oduot nRout laep p1l0yb t5o-:1 • tpruardcihnags pesla onfs ,t hsee eC Soemctpioanny V’sI sbeecluorwit.i esF frroomm t itmhee Ctoo mtimpaen, ye voern stasl wesi lol fo tchceu r Cthoamt apraen my’ast esericaul rtioti eths et oC tohme pCaonmy paanndy c; au• seex ceercrtiasiens ooff fsitcoecrks, odpirteiocntosr os,r oort heemr pelqouyietye sa twoa brde si no rp tohses essusriroenn doef rm oaft eshriaarle ns oton ptuhbe liCco imnfpoarmnya tiino np.a yWmheennt tohfa tth hea epxpeerncsis, eth per iCceo morp iann ysa wtisilfla creticoonm omf eanndy tthaxat wthiothsheo ilnd ipnogs soebslsiigoanti oonf sth ien ma amtearninale rn opnerpmubitltiecd by the applicable equity award agreement, or vesting of equity-based awards that, in each case, do not involve a market sale of the Company’s securities (the “cashless exercise” of a Company stock option through a broker does involve a market sale of the Company’s securities, and therefore would not qualify under this exception); or • purchases or sales of the Company’s securities made pursuant to any bindingc ontract, specific instruction or written plan entered into while the purchaser ors eller, as applicable, was unaware of any material nonpublic information and whichc ontract, instruction, or plan (i) meets all requirements of the affirmative defense provided by Rule 10b5-1 (“Rule 10b5-1”) promulgated under the SecuritiesE xchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), (ii) was precleared in advance pursuant to this Policy and (iii) has not been amended or modified in any respect after such initial preclearance without such amendment or modification\n\n3 information suspend all trading in the Company’s securities until the information is no longer material or has been publicly disclosed.

These definitions extend to a broad range of transactions, including conventional cash-for-stock transactions, conversions, the exercise of stock options, and acquisitions and exercises of warrants or puts, calls, or other derivative securities.A .

Note that, depending on the Company’s previous disclosure history, simply posting information to the Company’s website may not be sufficient disclosure to make the information public. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, does not constitutee ffective public dissemination. In addition, even after a public announcement, a reasonable period of time must lapse in order for the market to react to the information. Generally, one should allow at least two\n\n5 the Company’s securities are directed by you, or subject to your influence and control. This Policy also applies to any entities you control, including any corporations, partnerships, or trusts, andt ransactions by these entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. D. Trading by Persons Other Than InsidersI nsiders may be liable for communicating or tipping material nonpublic information to a third party (“tippee”), and insider trading violations are not limited to trading or tipping by insiders. Persons other than insiders can also be liable for insider trading, including tippees who trade on material nonpublic information tipped to them or individuals who trade on material nonpublici nformation that has been misappropriated. Insiders may be held liable for tipping even if theyr eceive no personal benefit from tipping and even if no close personal relationship exists between them and the tippee.T ippees inherit an insider’s duties and are liacbolne tfroorll tirnagd pinegrs oonn mofa ate vriiaoll antoonr p(ui.bel.i, cw hinerfeo rtmhea tivoino liallteogr ailsl ya nti pempepdl otoy eteh eomr obtyh earn c ionnstirdoelrle. dS ipmeirlsaornly), ojfu sutp a tso i nthsied gerres aatreer loiaf b$l1e. 4fo2r5 t mheil liinosni doerr t thrraedei ntigm oefs tthheei ra tmipopuenets ,o sf op raorefi tt igpapieneesd w ohr olo psass asv tohied iendf obrym tahteio vni oallaotnogr; to others who trade. In other words, a tippee’s liability for insider trading is no different from that of an insider. Tippeesc an obtain material nonpublic information by receiving overt tips from others or through, amongo ther things, conversations at social, business, or other gatherings.E . Penalties for Engaging in Insider Trading Penalties for trading on or tipping material nonpublic information can extend significantly beyond any profits made or losses avoided, both for individuals engaging in such unlawful conduct and their employers. The SEC and Department of Justice have made the civil and criminal prosecution of insider trading violations a top priority. Enforcement remedies available to the government or private plaintiffs under the federal securities laws include: • SEC administrative sanctions; • securities industry self-regulatory organization sanctions;• civil injunctions;• damage awards to private plaintiffs; • disgorgement of all profits; • civil fines for the violator of up to three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided; • civil fines for the employer or other\n\n6 • criminal fines for individual violators of up to $5 million ($25 million for an entity); and • jail sentences of up to 20 years.I n addition, insider trading could result in serious sanctions by the Company, including dismissal. Insider trading violations are not limited to violations of the federal securities laws. Other federal and state civil or criminal laws, such as the laws prohibiting mail and wire fraud and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), may also be violated in connection with insider trading. F. Size of Transaction and Reason for Transaction Do Not Matter The size of the transaction or the amount of profit received does not have to be significant to result in prosecution. The SEC has the ability to monitor even the smallest trades, and the SEC performs routine market surveillance. Brokers or dealers are required by law to inform the SEC of any possible violations by people wahnod m 2a0y y heaavrse imn ajateilr.i aDl enpoennpduinbgli cu pinofno rtmhea tciiornc.u Tmhseta SnEceCs, aX g gCroerspsiovrealtyio inn vaensdt itghaet eins deivveind usaml atoll winhsoidmer t htrea doifnfgic evri orleaptioorntss .c oGu.l dE xaalsmo pblee sl ioafb lIena ssi dceorn Ttrroaldliinngg pEerxsaomnsp.l Tesr aodfi nings ibdye rT tirpapdeine g Acans eosf fiinccelru odfe Xac Ctioornpso brraotiuognh tte allgsa ain fsrti eonfdfi cthearst ,X d iCreocrtpoorsr,a atinodn e ims apblooyuet etso wpuhbol itcralyd eadn nino uan ccoem thpaatn iyt ’hsa sse ccounrictliuesd eadft earn laegarrneeinmge onft sfoigrn ai fmicaajnotr c aocnqfuidiseintitoianl. cTohripso triapt ecd aeuvseelso ptmhee nfrtsie; nfdri eton dpsu, rbcuhsaisnee sXs aCsosropcoiaratetiso, nfa’sm sitloyc mk einm abdevrsa,n acned o of tthheer tippees of such officers, directors, and employees who traded in the securities after receiving such information; governmente mployees who learned of such information in the course of their employment; and other persons who misappropriated, and took advantage of, confidential information from their employers. The following are illustrations of insider trading violations. These illustrations are hypothetical and, consequently, not intended to reflect on the actual activities or business of the Company or any other entity. Trading by Insider An officer of X Corporation learns that earnings to be reported by X Corporationw ill increase dramatically. Prior to the public announcement of such earnings, the officer purchases X Corporation’s stock. The officer, an insider, is liable for all profits as well as penalties of up to three times the amount of all profits. The officer is also subject to, among other things, criminal prosecution, including up to $5m illion in additional fines\n\n7 announcement. The officer is jointly liable with his friend for all of the friend’s profits, and each is liable for all civil penalties of up to three times the amount of the friend’s profits. The officer and his friend are also subject to criminal prosecution and other remedies and sanctions, as described above.H . Prohibition of Records Falsification and False Statements Section 13(b)(2) of the 1934 Act requires companies subject to the 1934 Act to maintain proper internal books and records and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The SEC has supplemented the statutory requirements by adopting rules that prohibit (i) any person from falsifying recordso othre arc tcroaduinntgs ssuubspjeecnts tioo nth pee ariboodv ed ercelqaureirde mbye nthtse, Canodm p(iain) yo,f feixcceersp to fro dri:r e•c ptourrsc hfraosmes mofa tkhien gC aonmyp manayte’rsi asellcyu fraitlisees, fmroismle tahdei nCgo, morp ianncyo morp slaeltees s otaft ethmee nCt toom paannyy a’csc soeucnutraitniet sin t oc othnen eCcotimonp awniyth; a•n eyx aeurcdiiste os ro ffi lsitnogc kw oitpht itohnes S oErC o.t hTehre esqeu pirtyo vaiwsiaorndss ,r ethflee cstu trhreen SdEeCr ’osf isnhtaernets t oto d tihsec oCuormagpea onfyf iicne rpsa, ydmireenctto orfs ,t haen de xoethrceirs ep eprrsiocen so wr iinth s aacticsefascs ttioo nth oef Canoym tpaaxn wy’ist hhboolodkinsg a onbdl irgeactoiordnss firno ma m taakninnegr apcetriomni tttheadt bmyi gthhet arepspullitc ainb lteh ee qcuoimtym auwnaircda taiognre oefm menatt,e roira ltlhye mveisstlienagd ionfg e fqiuniatnyc-biaals iendf oarwmaartdiso nth taot tdhoe ninovt einstvinoglv pe uab mlica.r kFeatl ssiafylei nogf rtheceo Crdosm opra ancyc’osu snetcsu orirt imesa k(tihneg cmasahtelersias lelyx efarclsisee, mofi sal eCaodminpga, noyr isntocockm oppletitoe ns ttahtreomuegnht sa ibnr cooknenr edcoteiosn iwnvitohl vane aa umdaitr koer tf islainleg o wf itthhe tCheo mSEpCan cyo’su lsde caulsroit ireess,u alnt din t hcerirmefionrael wpeonualldti enso tf oqru oalbisfytr uucntdioenr tohfi sju esxticceep. tiIoVn). ;S atnatde m•e pnut rocfh Pasroesc eodru sraelse sto o Pf rtheve eCnot mInpsaidneyr’ sT sraedcuinrgit iTehs em faodlleo pwuirnsgu apnrot ctoe daunrye sb hinadvien gbc eoennt reasctat,b slipsehceidfi,c a innds twruicllt iboen ,m oari nwtariitnteend palnadn eennftoerrceedd i,n btoy wthheil eC othme ppaunryc htoas perre ovrent insider trading. A. Blackout Periods The period during which the Company prepares quarterly financials is a sensitive time for insider trading purposes, as Company personnel may be more likely to possess, or be presumed to possess, material nonpublic information. To avoid the appearance of impropriety and assist Companyp ersonnel in planning transactions in the Company’s securities for appropriate times, no officer, director, or employee shall purchase or sell any security of the Company during the period beginning the 15th day of the third month of the fiscal quarter of the Company and ending uponc ompletion of the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter or during any\n\n8 seller, as applicable, was unaware of any material nonpublic information and whichc ontract, instruction, or plan (i) meets all requirements of the affirmative defense provided by Rule 10b5-1, (ii) was precleared in advance pursuant to this Policy, and (iii) has not been amended or modified in any respect after such initial preclearance without such amendment or modificationp breoipnogs epdre tcrlaenasraecdt iionn a, davnadn scheo puulrds uinacnltu tdoe t hthise Pidoelnictyit.yE oxfc ethpeti oPnresc tloe athraen bclea cPkeorsuotn p, etrhieo dty ppoel iocfy p mroapyo bseed a ptrparnosvaecdti oonn l(yfo bry e xthaem Cpolem, panan oyp’es nG menaerkraeltC pouurncsheals oer, aC phrieivf aFteinlya nnceigalo tOiaftfeicde sra oler,, iann tohpet icoanse e oxfe recxiscee,p etitocn.)s, tfhoer dpirroepcotosersd, dthaete B oofa trhde o tfr aDnsiraeccttioorns, a nodr Athued nitu Cmobmerm oift tsehea oref st hoer Botohaerrd s oecf uDriitrieecst otors b. e Finrovmol vtiemd.e Itno atidmdeit,i othne, tChoe mPrpeacnlyea, rtahnrocue gPhe rtshoen B mouasrtd eoxfe Dcuirtee cat ocresr,t itfhiec aCtioomn p(iann tyh’es fGoermne raaplp Croovuends bely o trh eC hGieenf eFrianla Cncoiuanl sOelf foicr eCr,h mieaf yF irneacnocmiaml eOnfdf itcheart) othffaitc heres o, rd isrheec tiosr ns,o et mawplaorye eoefs ,m oart eortihael rns osnupsupbelnicd itnrfaodrimnga tiino nth aeb Couotm thpea nCyo’sm speacnuyri.t iTehs eb eGcaeunseer aolf C doeuvnelsoepl more Cnthsi ethf aFt ihnaavnec inaol tO yfefitc beer e(no rd tihsecilro dseedsi tgon ethees )p suhballilc h. aSvueb jseoclte tdoi sthcere etixocne ptoti odnesc indoet wedh eatbhoerv eto, acllle tahro asney a fcfoenctteemd pshlaotuedld t rnaonts tarcatdioei nn. t(hTeh Ce oGmepnaenrayl’ sC soeucnusreitli eshs awllh hilaev teh seo slue sdpiesncrseiotino nis tion deeffceicdte, awnhde tshheoru tlod cnloeta rd itsracnlossaec ttioo nosth beyrs t hthea Ct thhiee fC Foimnapnacniya lh Oasf fsiucsepr eonrd peedr storandsi nogr .e nBti. tPierse csulebajreacnt cteo othf iAs pllo Tlircayd aess ab yr eAsulll tO offf itcheerisr, rDeliarteicotnosrhsi pan wd iCthe trhtaei nC Ehimefp Floinyaenesc iaTlo O pfrfoicveird)e A alsls tirsatadnecse t hina tp arreev pernetcinlega irneadd mveurstte nbte veifofleacttieodn sw oifth aipnp fliivcea bblues sineceussr idtiaeys sl aowf sr eacnedip tot oafv tohied pthreec alepapreaanrcaen,c uen olef sism ap rsoppercieiftiyc ienx ccoenpntieocnt ihoans wbietehn t hgera pnutercdh bayse t haen dG seanleer oalf Cthoeu Cnsoeml poar nCyh’ise sfe cFuinriatinecsi,a al lOl tfrfaicnesra.c Atio npsr einc ltehaer eCdo tmrapdaen (yo’rs asneycu proitrietiso n(i nocfl ua dpirnegc,l ewairtehdo utrta ldime)i ttahtaito hna, sa cnqout ibsieteionn esf feacntde dd idsuproisnigti othnes foifv eC obmuspianneyss s dtoacyk p, ethrieo dex merucsits eb eo fp sretoccleka orepdti oagnas,i ne lpercitoivr eto t reaxnescaucttiioonn.s Nunodtweri th4s0t1an(kd)i/nEgS rPePc/edipeft eorfr edp creocmlepaernansacteio, nif pthlaen Ps,r eacnlde atrhaen scael eP eorfs oCno mbepcaonmy esst oacwka irses uoef dm uapteornia el xneorncipsueb olfi cs tioncfko rompatitoionns )o br yb eocfofimceerss ,s udbirjeecctto tros ,a a bnlda cckeortuati np ekreiyo de mbepflooryee tehse l itsratends aocnti oSnc hies deufflee cIt e(ads, tahme etnradnesda ctfiroonm m tiamy en toot tbime ec)o m(epacleht,e da .“Preclearance Person”) must be precleared by the Company’s General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer (or their designees), except for certain exempt transactions ase xplained in Section VI of this Policy.

In addition, such information should not be communicated to anyone outside the Company under any circumstances (except in accordance with the Company’s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company information) or to anyone within the Company on any other than a “need-to-know” basis. In communicating material nonpublic information to employees of the Company, all officers, directors, and employees must take care to emphasize the need for confidential treatment of such information and adherence to the Company’s policies with regard to confidentiali nformation. 2. Inquiries From Third Parties Inquiries from third parties, such as industry analysts or members of the media, about theC ompany should be directed to the General Counsel or the Chief Financial Officer.

Review of confidential documents in public places should be conducted so as to prevent access by unauthorized persons;\n\n10 • restricting access to documents and files (including computer files) containing material nonpublic information to individuals on a “need-to-know” basis (includingm aintaining control over the distribution of documents and drafts of documents); • promptly removing and cleaning up all confidential documents and other materials from conference rooms following the conclusion of any meetings;• disposing of all confidential documents and other papers once there is no longera ny business or other legally required need — through shredders when appropriate;• restricting access to areas likely to contain confidential documents or material nonpublic information;• safeguarding laptop computers, tablets, memory sticks, CDs, and other items that contain confidential information; and • avoiding the discussion of material nonpublic information idne plilvaecre st hwe hsehraer eths ew iitnhfionr 2m0a tdioayns c aofuteldr tbhee osvaleer.h eBa.r dP ubbyl ioctlhye Trsr,a sduecdh Oasp tiino nelse Ava ttroarnss, arcetsitorno oinm os,p htiaolnlws aisy, si,rn e setfafuercat,n ats ,b aeitr opnla nthees ,s ohro rrti-dtee rhma imlinogv esmerevnict eosf.P tehres oCnonmelp iannvyo’lsv esdt owcikt ha nmda tthereiraelf nooren pcruebaltiecs i nthfeo ramppateiaorna,n tcoe t thhea et xatne notf ffiecaesri,b dleir,e schtooru,l do cr oenmdpulcoty tehee iirs btruasdininegss b aansded a ocnti vmitaietesr iinal anroeansp usebpliacr aintef ofrrmomat iootnh.e Tr Craonmsapcatinoyn sa cinti voiptiteios.n sV m.

Therefore, officers, directors, and employees shall comply with the following policiesw ith respect to certain transactions in the Company securities: A. Short Sales Short sales of the Company’s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no confidence in the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce thes eller’s incentive to improve the Company’s performance. For these reasons, short sales of theC ompany’s securities are prohibited by this Policy. In addition, as noted below, Section 16(c) of the 1934 Act absolutely prohibits Section 16 reporting persons from making short sales of the Company’s equity securities, i.e., sales of shares that the insider does not own at the time of sale, or sales of shares against which the insider does not\n\n11 Company’s equity securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, are prohibited by this Policy. C. Hedging Transactions Certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars andf orward sale contracts, allow an officer, director, or employee to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock. Such transactions allow the officer, director, or employee to continue to own the covereds ecurities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the officer, director, or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company’s others tockholders. Therefore, such transactions in1v0oblv5i-n1g a tnhde aCllo ampppalincya’bsl ee qsutaittey lsaewcus r(iati e“sT araredp inrogh Piblaitne”d) bthya tth: i•s hPaosl ibceye.

E. Partnership Distributions Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit the ability of a venture capital partnership oro ther similar entity with which a director is affiliated to distribute Company securities to its partners, members, or other similar persons. It is the responsibility of each affected director and the affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel (as appropriate), to determine the timing of any distributions, based on all relevant facts and circumstances and applicable securities laws.V I.

Sales of Company securities by affiliates (generally, Section 16 Insiders of the Company) must comply with the requirements of Rule 144, which are summarized below: • Current Public Information. The Company must have filed all SEC-required reports during the last 12 months. •\n\n15 to buy and sell Company common stock for his own account on a regular and continuous basis. • Notice of Proposed Sale. A notice of the sale (a Form 144) must be filed with the SEC at the time of the sale. Brokers generally have internal procedures for executing sales under Rule 144 and will assist you in completing the Form 144 and in complying with the other requirements of Rule 144. If you are subject to Rule 144, you must instruct your broker who handles trades in Company securities to follow the brokerage firm’s Rule 144 compliance procedures in connection with all trades.\n\n16 Schedule IK ey Employees Subject to Preclearance RequirementN one.\n\n17 Attachment A Short-Swing Profit Rule Section 16(b) ChecklistN ote: ANY combination of PURCHASE AND SALE or SALE AND PURCHASE within six months of each other by an officer, director, or 10% stockholder (or any family member living in the same household or certain affiliated entities) results in a violation of Section 16(b), and the “profit” must be recovered by ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (the “Company”). It makes no difference how long the shares being sold have been held or, for officers and directors, that you were an insider for only one of the two matching transactions. The highest priced sale will be matched witht he lowest priced purchase within the six-month period. SalesI f a sale is to be made by an officer, director, or 10% stockholder (or any family memberl iving in the same household or certain affiliated entities): 1. Have there been any purchases by the insider (or family members living in the same household or certain affiliated entities) within the past six months? 2. Have there been any option grants or exercises not exempt under Rule 16b-3 withint he past six months?3 . Are any purchases (or nonexempt option exercises) anticipated or required within the next six months?4 . Has a Form 4 been prepared?
