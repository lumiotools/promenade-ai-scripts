          "content": "Anti-Corruption and FCPA Compliance Policy\nPurpose and Scope\nVicor Corporation (“Vicor” or “the Company”) must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Prac-\ntices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\") and all applicable anti-corruption laws, both domes-\ntically and internationally. This Policy sets the expectation and requirements for compliance with\nthose laws.\nFor purposes of this policy, “bribery” is defined in both the traditional sense of “offering, giving,\nreceiving, or soliciting of something of value for the purpose of influencing the action of an offi-\ncial in the discharge of his or her defined public or legal duties” and the expanded sense of re-\nsponsibilities.\nGeneral Policy\nNo Company director, employee, agent, consultant, representative, distributor, licensee, or joint\nventure partner (\"Company Representative(s)\") has authority to violate the FCPA or any appli-\ncable anti-corruption law.\nThe FCPA prohibits Company Representatives from corruptly paying, offering to pay, or giving\nanything of value to any Foreign Official (as defined below) in order to influence the Foreign Of-\nficial in his or her official capacity to induce the Foreign Official to do or omit to do an act in vio-\nlation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtain-\ning or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. All Company Repre-\nsentatives are obligated to keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect\nall transactions and disposition of Company assets.\nCompliance with Laws; No Improper Payments\nCountries around the world are adopting anti-corruption laws, which make bribery a crime. Both\nthe Company and Company Representatives are governed by these laws and must abide by\nthem. Vicor prohibits all improper or unethical payments to any individual, including the Foreign\nOfficials who are the focus of FCPA restrictions, anywhere in the world.\nReporting Demands for a Bribe\nEvery person doing business with Vicor must understand a Company Representative will not,\nunder any circumstances, offer (implicitly or explicitly), give, or accept bribes or kickbacks. Any\ndemand for a bribe or payment of a bribe must be brought by Company Representatives, in writ-\ning, immediately to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer.\nViolations\nViolations of anti-corruption laws will subject both the Company and Company Representatives\nto fines and criminal penalties, including imprisonment. The Company will not pay any fines or\npenalties assessed against a Company Representative who is found guilty of violating any anti-\ncorruption laws.\nPage 1 of 6 Revised September 2015\nUnderstanding the FCPA\nThe following concepts and definitions are essential to understanding the scope of the FCPA’s\nanti-bribery provisions:\n The FCPA contains both anti-bribery and accounting provisions. As a registrant (i.e., public\ncompany filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), Vicor is subject to (a)\nanti-bribery provisions prohibiting Company Representatives from making corrupt payments\nto foreign officials to obtain or retain business, and (b) accounting provisions requiring regis-\ntrant to keep accurate books and records, while maintaining an adequate system of internal\naccounting controls. The accounting provisions also prohibit individuals and businesses\nfrom knowingly falsifying books and records or knowingly circumventing or failing to imple-\nment a system of internal controls.\n The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission share\nFCPA enforcement authority.\n The Company may be held liable for violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA\nwhether or not it took any action in the U.S. This means the Company and Company Rep-\nresentatives can be liable for the conduct of overseas Company Representatives, even if no\nmoney was transferred from the U.S. and no U.S. person participated in any way in the\nbribery.\n “Foreign Official(s)” means any non-U.S. government official (including employees of gov-\nernment-owned and government-controlled companies, and employees of public interna-\ntional organizations), political party, party official or candidate, and anyone working in an of-\nficial capacity for or on behalf of a non- U.S. government, government-owned or govern-\nment-controlled company, public international organization or political party. Some examples\nof Foreign Officials include: employees of state-owned or state-controlled companies, mem-\nbers of royal families, members of the military, employees of state-owned universities, em-\nployees of the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Union, the Monetary Fund,\nand immigration and customs officials. Foreign Officials include all levels and all ranks of\ngovernment officials, whether at the national, state, provincial, municipal, or other level.\n “Giving, offering or promising” includes direct and indirect payments, gifts, offers, or promis-\nes. Even if the improper payment is not consummated or successful in its objective, merely\noffering it violates the FCPA.\n Instructing, authorizing, or allowing a third party to make a prohibited payment on the Com-\npany’s behalf constitutes a violation of the FCPA by the Company and the individuals in-\nvolved. This includes ratifying a payment after the fact, or making a payment to a third party\nknowing or having reason to know that it will likely be given to a Foreign Official.\n “Anything of value” includes, but is not limited to, cash, cash equivalents (such as gift cards),\ngifts, travel, meals, entertainment, use of vehicles, accommodations or valuable favors, such\nas educational and employment opportunities for friends and relatives. For purposes of this\npolicy, a “thing of value” has no minimum value. Even a small gift is a “thing of value.”\n “Obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper advantage” includes, but is not lim-\nited to, preferential treatment in a bid or proposal, a reduction in taxes or customs duties, a\nfavorable change in regulations, tolerance of non-compliance with local rules, or other favors\nor preferential treatment. The business to be obtained or retained or the improper advantage\nneed not involve a contract with a foreign government or foreign government instrumentality.\nPage 2 of 6 Revised September 2015\nWhat the FCPA Prohibits\nThe FCPA has two parts: (1) the anti-bribery provisions and (2) the accounting (i.e., record\nkeeping and internal controls) provisions. Violations under these provisions have the following\nelements:\n(1) Anti-Bribery\nA violation of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions occurs when a payment, offer, or prom-\nise to pay anything of value, directly or indirectly, is corruptly made to any Foreign Offi-\ncial or anyone acting on behalf of a governmental international organization for the pur-\npose of obtaining or retaining business for or with or directing business, or to secure an\nimproper advantage.\n(a) Intent and knowledge of a bribe exist.\n1. An improper purpose is intended.\nThe FCPA prohibits payments intended to influence any act or decision of\na Foreign Official in his or her official capacity, to induce such official to\nundertake or not to undertake an act in violation of his or her lawful duty\nor secure an improper advantage; or induce such Foreign Official in his or\nher influence to affect or influence an act or decision of the government in\norder to obtain or retain business for or with or to direct business to a per-\nson or entity.\n2. Knowledge exists regarding payments made by third parties.\nThe FCPA also prohibits payments made by third parties to which or\nwhom a Company Representative pays or transfers value, knowing the\npayment or transfer will be passed on or made in whole or in part to a\nForeign Official. A Company Representative’s state of mind is “knowing”\nwith respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a result if the person is aware\nor has a firm belief a third party is engaging in such conduct, that such\ncircumstance exists, or that such result is substantially certain to occur.\nThe Company and a Company Representative may be held to have\n“knowledge” of an unlawful transaction, notwithstanding any attempts to\ninsulate themselves through willful blindness, ignorance, or conscious dis-\nregard of suspicious actions or circumstances.\n(b) Payments do not represent excluded “facilitating” payments.\nUnder limited circumstances, the FCPA allows modest payments to expedite or\nsecure the performance of certain routine government actions (e.g., common\nclerical activities) which do not involve the exercise of discretion. A “facilitating\npayment” is a payment of modest value, usually in cash, given to a government\nemployee to expedite or secure the performance of a routine governmental ac-\ntion. While anti-corruption laws prohibit bribes to government officials to influ-\nence decisions, the U.S. and some other countries may allow facilitating pay-\nments in limited situations. Examples include expediting utility services, provid-\ning needed police protection, or approving the granting of a work permit, customs\nclearance, or a visa to which the applicant is entitled. The term “routine govern-\nmental actions” does not include any decision by a Foreign Official whether or on\nwhat terms to award new business or to continue business with a particular party,\nPage 3 of 6 Revised September 2015\nor any action taken by a Foreign Official involved in the decision-making process\nto encourage a decision to award new business or to continue business with a\nparticular party.\nVicor strongly discourages the use of facilitating payments and absolutely prohib-\nits facilitating payments over US$100 or the local equivalent, without the prior\nwritten approval of the Compliance Officer. Two or more facilitating payments\nunder US$100 or the local equivalent to the same government official or employ-\nee in any twelve-month period without such prior written approval is also strictly\nprohibited. Approval of facilitating payments in excess of US$100 or the local\nequivalent will rarely be granted and only for good cause shown. Facilitating\npayments may not be made in contravention of local laws prohibiting such pay-\nments.\nAll facilitating payments over US$100 or the local equivalent require prior ap-\nproval by the Compliance Officer, in the absence of a Compliance Officer, the\nChief Financial Officer. The approval request must list the details of the proposed\npayment and include the amount, the recipient, the name of his or her employer,\nand the justification for the proposed payment, as well as any additional infor-\nmation requested by the approver.\nApproval requests are to be submitted to the Compliance Officer using the con-\ntact information listed at the end of this policy. The Compliance Officer will de-\ntermine whether the requested payment is or is not a permitted facilitating pay-\nment and will communicate the decision to the requester by e-mail or in a written\nmemo. The decision of the Compliance Officer is final and must be followed.\nAll facilitating payments, including those under US$100 or the local equivalent,\nmust be reported immediately after they are made to the Compliance Officer by\ne-mail at the contact information listed at the end of this policy. The report must\nlist the details of the payment to include the amount, the recipient, the name of\nhis or her employer, and the justification for the payment, as well as any addi-\ntional information requested by the Compliance Officer.\nIn addition, all facilitating payments must be recorded accurately and fairly in ex-\npense accounts and the Company’s books and records. Expense information\nshall include all information required pursuant to the Company’s expense ac-\ncount policies and procedures. Any facilitating payment must be accurately and\ntransparently recorded in the Company’s General Ledger.\nMaking facilitating payments in violation of this policy or applicable laws will sub-\nject a Company Representative to possible termination of employment and pros-\necution by authorities.\n(c) Payments representing extortion by a Foreign Official may be permitted, but only\nif a Company Representative’s physical safety is threatened.\nEconomic extortion, such as a threat to harm, delay, or interfere with the Compa-\nny’s business or the award of an order or contract, can never justify a payment\nthat would violate this policy. However, a payment arising from threats of physi-\ncal violence and a genuine concern for one’s personal safety is a payment made\nunder physical duress. When a payment is extorted by a Foreign Official who\nthreatens imminent bodily harm, a Company Representative may and should\nmake the payment that is demanded. Any extortion demand must be reported\nimmediately to the Compliance Officer, who will determine any additional actions\nPage 4 of 6 Revised September 2015\nto be taken, such as reporting the occurrence to the U.S. Embassy in the particu-\nlar country. Any such payment must be accurately and transparently recorded in\nthe Company’s General Ledger.\n(d) Expenses for promotion of services or performance of government contracts may\nbe permitted. The FCPA permits reasonable and bona fide expenses, such as\ntravel and lodging expenses, incurred by a Foreign Official in connection with the\npromotion, demonstration, or explanation of the Company’s products and ser-\nvices, or in the execution or performance of a foreign government contract. Such\nexpenses do not include those incurred by the Foreign Official’s spouse or family\nmember or the costs of a personal side trip. Any payment for expenses for pro-\nmotion of services or performance of government contracts must comply with the\nprovisions of Vicor’s Code of Business Conduct.\n(e) Charitable donations may be permitted, while political contributions are forbid-\nden. The FCPA does not prohibit charitable donations or political contributions,\nbut such payments can violate the FCPA when they are made with the intention\nof influencing an act or decision of a Foreign Official in his official capacity, to in-\nduce such Foreign Official to do or not to do an act in violation of his lawful duty\nor secure an improper advantage, or to induce such Foreign Official in his influ-\nence to affect or influence a decision of the government in order to obtain or re-\ntain business for or with, or to direct business to, a person or entity. Lawful chari-\ntable donations must comply with the provisions of Vicor’s Code of Business\nConduct.\n(2) Accounting\nVicor is required under the FCPA to keep books, records, and accounts in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly presenting the Company’s assets and how the Company’s\nmoney has been spent. Vicor has adopted a system of internal accounting and operating\ncontrols and procedures that must be strictly adhered to by all Company Representa-\ntives in providing financial and business transaction information to and within the Com-\npany, so that all underlying transactions are properly documented, recorded, and report-\ned. These internal controls are the backbone of the integrity of the Company’s financial\nrecords and financial statements. 1\nA failure to accurately and fairly document any transaction is a separate violation (i.e.,\ndistinct from an anti-bribery violation) of both the FCPA and this policy, whether the\ntransaction is legitimate, a facilitating payment, or an illegal bribe. This further highlights\nthe need to avoid improper payments altogether, to minimize the use of facilitating pay-\nments, and to maintain accurate books and records in any event.\n1 Under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nmust certify the financial statements presented in all periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nCriminal penalties for certifying a misleading or fraudulent financial report can be upwards of $5 million in fines\nand 20 years in prison.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires Vicor’s filings on Form 10-K with the Securities and\nExchange Commission to present management’s to report on, and the Company’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nVicor has an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply\nwith the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to continuously improve and remediate the Company’s in-\nternal controls over financial reporting, and, thereby, assure the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting\nsystems and procedures. The provisions of this Anti-Corruption and FCPA Compliance Policy, and the moni-\ntoring thereof, are important elements of this ongoing program.\nPage 5 of 6 Revised September 2015\nVicor expects Company Representatives that are not directors or employees of the\nCompany to maintain and keep books and records accurately and fairly recording trans-\nactions, services, and the purpose of any payments, including those detailed in invoices\nsubmitted to the Company.\nComplying with Anti-Corruption Laws\nWhile each Company Representative is individually responsible for conducting the Company’s\nactivities in a manner consistent with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and in compli-\nance with anti-corruption laws wherever Vicor operates, a Company Representative does not do\nso alone. Vicor has the resources, personnel, and processes to answer questions and guide\nCompany Representatives through difficult decisions. The Compliance Officer periodically con-\nducts a formal training program, addressing this policy, Vicor’s reporting mechanisms, and the\nexplanation of internal controls and procedures. This compliance training is intended to help\nassure compliance with anti-bribery laws and especially detect and deter violations of the FCPA\nand any other applicable anti-corruption laws.\nFurther Information\nAnti-corruption laws around the world can be complex and far reaching. This policy is not in-\ntended to be an explanation of all the specific provisions of those laws or an exhaustive list of\nactivities or practices that could affect the reputation and goodwill of the Company’s business.\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with the Company's other policies governing employee\nconduct and any questions should be addressed to the Chief Financial Officer or the Compli-\nance Officer. This policy may be more restrictive than the letter of the international anti-\ncorruption laws and/or the FCPA. In the case of any inconsistency between any other Company\npolicy and this policy, the provisions of this policy shall govern.\nA useful resource can be found on the website of the U.S. Department of Justice:\nhttp://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/guide.pdf.\nPage 6 of 6 Revised September 2015"
