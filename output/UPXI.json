(NASDAQ:UPXI) (the \"Company\" or \"Upexi\"), a multi-faceted Amazon and Direct-to-Consumer brand owner and innovator in aggregation, announces the Company has filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada to pursue the groups and individuals who orchestrated the manipulative and fraudulent activity in the shares round-up scheme related to Upexi's reverse stock split. Upexi anticipates that the court, through the discovery process, will enable the Company to determine who are the individuals owning the accounts and engaged in the manipulative trading transactions within those accounts in connection with and around the announcement and effective date of Upexi's reverse stock split. The Company and its legal team will pursue aggressively obtaining the relief that it seeks in the Complaint.\n\nThe Company previously announced the reverse stock split. Several weeks subsequent to the effective date, the financial institutions where the suspect trading took place requested 202,183 round-up shares, which represented more than a 19% dilution to our current shareholders and an increase of approximately 40 times the number of individual shareholders owning the Company's common stock immediately prior to the reverse split. The foregoing activity appears to have occurred during the three-day trading period between the announcement of the reverse split and its effective date.\n\nAllan Marshall, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"The company has taken the first and precedent-setting action in exposing the blatant manipulation around reverse stock splits. Since our previous release regarding this issue, I have been contacted by a number of companies who also were victims of this damaging stock manipulation scheme. I am astonished by the extent of the evidentiary support and encouragement I have received from multiple sources to advance our claims against those whom we believe manipulated the shares of Upexi and other securities. We believe that the evidence will identify and establish organized group trading, groups charging fees to buy and distribute shares for individuals, and individuals opening up to 50 individual accounts to perpetrate the scheme. The fact that so many microcap companies and their shareholders have been damaged in compliant reverse stock splits with no regulatory intervention to protect them against such manipulative activity is unacceptable, and we hope this lawsuit will bring into focus the need for regulatory changes to bring to an end these sinister and deceptive practices. We will follow through with this lawsuit for as long as it takes and hopefully undo some of the damage perpetrated against our shareholders by third parties and to investors in many other companies as well.\"\n\nUpexi has identified other Nasdaq-listed companies that were victimized by similar manipulative conduct, possibly by the same perpetrators. Some of those companies may join the case as co-Plaintiffs given the common conduct and manipulative trading patterns detected, or they may pursue relief independently.\n\n**About Upexi, Inc.:**\n\nUpexi is a multi-faceted brand owner with established brands in the health, wellness, pet, beauty, and other growing markets. We operate in emerging industries with high growth trends and look to drive organic growth of our current brands. We focus on direct to consumer and Amazon brands that are scalable and have anticipated, high industry growth trends. Our goal is to continue to accumulate consumer data and build out a significant customer database across all industries we sell into.

(NASDAQ:UPXI) (the \"Company\" or \"Upexi\"), a multi-faceted Amazon and Direct-to-Consumer (\"DTC\") brand owner and innovator in aggregation, today reported its financial results for the fiscal third quarter 2024 ending March 31, 2024.\n\nAllan Marshall, CEO of Upexi, commented, \"Our year-over-year quarterly financial results include management's decision to discontinue sales of certain products. Subsequent to the quarter, we made continued progress on our restructuring, which is estimated to provide us with sufficient working capital to fund our operations while reducing our debt to a minimal level. We anticipate the restructuring efforts to result in a leaner more scalable business with an improved balance sheet. Current market conditions and the lack of a healthy lending market has made these difficult decisions necessary. The alternative of a highly dilutive equity raise was a non-starter for management and hard decisions were made to give shareholders the best opportunity for future success. This reset will allow management to focus on opportunities for profitable growth without the debt issue hampering success. We will provide our shareholders with an updated outlook on our operations and detailed financial goals as we complete the final stages as quickly as possible.\"\n\n**Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024:**\n\nRevenues decreased 34% to $14.4 million compared to $21.9 million in the same period the prior year. The revenue decline was primarily the result of lower recommerce revenue through both Amazon channels and wholesale. Management also decided to discontinue sales of electronic products in its Amazon channels after analyzing the high rate of returned products, lower margins after thirty to sixty days and the low liquidation value of Amazon returns. Branded Product sales increased slightly with increases in pet care products, children's toy products and other branded products that are not heavily reliant on the Amazon sales channel. Management is in the process of restructuring the Company to have more consistent sales from both product sales revenue and adding service revenue.\n\nCost of revenue decreased 19% to $11.6 million compared with cost of revenue of $14.3 million in the same period last year. The cost of revenue decline was primarily related to the lower recommerce revenue. Gross profit decreased by approximately $1.7 million compared to the same period the prior year due to significant write-offs of inventory that were obsolete or unsellable. These products that were written off were primarily related to the recommerce business with many of them being Amazon returns or bulk products that could no longer be sold.\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased 32% compared with the same period in the prior year. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to management's efforts to refine sales strategies to focus on long-term recurring sales growth through subscription revenue and sales channel expansion. Management will continue to manage the sales and marketing expenses on branded product sales and expects the overall sales and marketing revenue to decrease and improve profitability.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 8% compared with the same period in the prior year. With the consolidation of facilities and ongoing adjustments for the sale of VitaMedica, Infusionz and Interactive Offers, management has managed the general and administrative costs and will continue to implement strategies to decrease the percentage of general and administrative costs when compared to total sales.\n\nOther operating expenses decreased 37% compared with the same period in the prior year. These expenses are primarily non-cash expenses and have decreased based on the decreased amortization of stock compensation and offset by increases in depreciation.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had other expense of $661,878 compared to expense of $152,360 during the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the interest on debt. Management is working to eliminate this high interest debt as it restructures the Company.\n\nThe Company had a net loss of $4.1 million compared with a loss of $1.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income loss is related to the decrease in sales, the non-cash write off of $1.7 million in inventory and the costs associated with the distribution network until it was consolidated in June of 2024. Management expects additional administrative expenses related to the consolidation of the distribution network through June of 2024 and will then be able to recognize the improvements in fiscal year 2025.\n\n**Subsequent Events:**\n\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company entered into a new lease agreement reducing annualized operating expenses, an agreement to sell its warehouse for approximately $1.4 million after repayment of the mortgage and transaction expenses, and sale of a wholly owned subsidiary. While as of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $498,287, based on the progress the Company has made on its restructuring, it is estimated that the Company will have sufficient working capital to fund its operations over the twelve months following the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements and meet all debt obligations.\n\n**About Upexi, Inc.:**\n\nUpexi is a multi-faceted brand owner with established brands in the health, wellness, pet, beauty, and other growing markets.

These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\n\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. As a result, it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, such as the COVID-19 outbreak and associated business disruptions including delayed clinical trials and laboratory resources, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Considering these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.\n\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.

Infusionz was originally purchased by the Company in July of 2020. The divestiture of Infusionz and related private label manufacturing represents a strategic shift in our operations and will allow us to become a predominantly product distribution focused company for both our Company owned brands and non-owned brands. As a result, the results of the business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.\n\nF-6  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc2)_  \n  \nOn August 31, 2023, Upexi, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (“EIPA”) pursuant to which the Company sold one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding equity (the “Interests”) of its wholly owned subsidiary Interactive Offers, LLC (“Interactive”) to Amplifyir Inc. (the “Buyer”). The purchase price for the Interests was One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000), subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. In addition, the Buyer is obligated to pay the Company two-and one- half percent (2.5%) of certain advertising revenues of Interactive for a two-year period post-closing. Accordingly, the results of the business were classified as discontinued operations in our statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.\n\nOn June 13, 2024, Upexi, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) pursuant to which the Company sold one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding equity (the “Interests”) of its wholly owned subsidiary VitaMedica, Inc. to three investors (the “Buyers”). One of the minority Interest Buyers is Allan Marshall, the Company’s Chief Executive Officers. The purchase price for the stock was Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000), subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. In addition, the Buyers are obligated to pay the Company for services provided according to the Transition Services Agreement. Accordingly, the results of the business were classified as discontinued operations in our statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.\n\n_Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest as of March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.\n\n_Discontinued Operations_\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of options and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. In accordance with the rules regarding the presentation of discontinued operations, the assets, liabilities, and activity of Infusionz, Interactive Offers, VitaMedica and certain manufacturing business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. \n\n_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_\n\nASC Topic 820,  _Fair Value Measurement_ (“ASC 820”), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguished between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumption about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc2)_  \n  \nASC 820 identified fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:\n\nLevel 1—Quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.\n\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs developed using estimates or assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.\n\nTo the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nThe carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values, due to their short-term nature. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, management believed it necessary to record a reserve against the debt and equity instruments obtained in the sale of Infusionz of $8,500,000. \n\n_Reclassification_\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2023, and as of June 30, 2023 to conform to the presentation as of and for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Note 2. Acquisitions**\n\n**Cygnet Online, LLC**\n\nThe Company acquired 55% of Cygnet Online, LLC, on April 1, 2022.

The purchase agreement provided for an increase in the purchase price of up to $700,000 based on the attainment of certain sales thresholds in the first year. Our management believed that the attainment of those sales threshold at the time of acquisition was unlikely and valued the contingency at $0. The sales thresholds were not met, and no consideration was recorded for the contingency. The equity interest purchase agreement has standard provisions to adjust the purchase price based on the final working capital transferred to the Company. The purchase price was decreased by $950,000 and was repaid to the Company with a reduction in the loan to the seller. The 55% purchase price allocation is final and is no longer subject to change.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% interest for structured cash payments equaling $800,000, the forgiveness of advances of $89,416 and 90,909 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $162,727.

The resulting combination increased Cygnet’s product offerings through the Company’s distributors and partnerships as it continues to focus on over-the-counter supplements and beauty products. Cygnet will be the anchor company for Upexi’s Amazon strategy. These are the factors of goodwill recognized in the acquisition. The Company’s management is evaluating the intangible assets of this acquisition and had not reached a conclusion on any impairment of these intangible assets at the time of this report. \n\n**LuckyTail**\n\nOn August 13, 2022, the Company acquired the pet product brand and the rights to the products of LuckyTail from GA Solutions, LLC. \n\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred to acquire LuckyTail and the amount of identified assets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\n\nFair value of consideration transferred:  \n---  \nCash| $| 2,000,000  \nCash payment, 90 days after close| 484,729  \nCash payment, 180 days after close| 469,924  \nContingent consideration| 112,685  \nCash payment, working capital adjustment| 460,901  \n$| 3,528,239  \nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed:  \nInventory| $| 460,901  \nTrade name| 383,792  \nCustomer list| 1,834,692  \nTotal identifiable net assets| $| 2,679,385  \nGoodwill| $| 848,854  \nF-10  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc2)_  \n  \nThe business was acquired through an asset purchase agreement, that acquired all elements of the business, including all the tangible and intangible assets of the LuckyTail business. The purchase agreement provided for an increase in the purchase price based on the attainment of certain sales thresholds in the first six months. The Company estimated the value of this at approximately $150,000 at the time of purchase. The sales calculated to a $112,685 payout and the purchase price was adjusted. The asset purchase agreement has standard provisions to adjust the purchase price based on the final working capital transferred to the Company. The purchase price was increased by $460,901 for the excess working capital that was transferred in the business and the final purchase price allocation was completed by an independent consulting firm and is no longer subject to change. \n\nThe consolidated financial include the actual results of LuckyTail from August 13, 2022 through March 31, 2024.

Stock-based compensation expense attributable to stock options was $965,229 and $3,126,472 for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, there was $330,455 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options outstanding, and the weighted average vesting period for those options was approximately year.\n\nThe value of each grant is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option model with the following assumptions for options granted during the nine months ended March31, 2024 and March 31, 2023:\n\n**March 31,****2024**| **March 31,****2023**  \n---|---  \nDividend rate| -| -  \nRisk free interest rate| 3.95| %| 2.07-4.06| %   \nExpected term| 1| 1  \nExpected volatility| 63| %| 70-77| %  \nGrant date stock price| $| 1.47| $|  3.87-5.30  \n  \nThe basis for the above assumptions are as follows: the dividend rate is based upon the Company’s history of dividends; the risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected term was calculated based on the Company’s historical pattern of options granted and the period of time they are expected to be outstanding; and expected volatility was calculated based upon historical trends in the Company’s stock prices.\n\nForfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on historical experience of forfeitures, the Company estimated forfeitures at 0% for each of the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nF-23  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc2)_  \n  \n**Note 13. Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company computed the year-to-date income tax provision by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to the year-to-date pre-tax income and adjusted for discrete tax items in the period. The Company’s income tax benefit was $1,501,595 and $2,668,769 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, and $496,880 and $449,828 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe income tax expense for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to federal and state income taxes and nondeductible expenses for an effective tax rate of approximately 29%. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate is due to the full valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets.\n\nFuture realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. The Company also considered whether there was any currently available information about future years. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will have future taxable income to fully realize the Company’s deferred tax asset.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, there was approximately $10,472,757 of losses available to reduce federal taxable income in future years and can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n**Note 14. Risks and Uncertainties**\n\nThere is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics, and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in different markets.\n\n**Note 15. Discontinued Operations – Sale of Infusionz to Bloomios**\n\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company determined that the best course of action related to Infusionz, LLC and certain manufacturing business was to accept an offer to sell those operations. \n\nThe Company received from Bloomios, Inc., (OTCQB:BLMS), the purchaser (i) $5,500,000 paid at closing; (ii) a convertible secured subordinated promissory note in the original principal amount of $5,000,000; (iii) 85,000 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock, with a total stated value of $8,500,000; (iv) a senior secured convertible debenture with a subscription amount of $4,500,000, after original issue discount of $779,117; and (v) a common stock purchase warrant to purchase up to 2,853,910 shares of Bloomios’s common stock.

Our Branded Product segment is focused on the development, growth, and distribution of the branded products that we own. Our Recommerce segment is focused on the purchase and sale of new and used products through channels such as Amazon and wholesale distributors. Other sources of revenue and related costs are aggregated and viewed by management as immaterial or have similar economic characteristics, product production, distribution processes and regulatory environment as the other product sales.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the share-based compensation of 212,758 and $1,146,299, respectively was allocated to the Branded Product segment. For the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the share-based compensation of $965,299 and 3,126,472, respectively was allocated to the Branded Product segment. \n\nAll indirect corporate and public company general and administrative expenses are allocated to the Branded Product Segment. \n\n5  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \n**Segment Information**\n\nThe Company provides the following segments: (a) branded products segment and (b) recommerce segment.\n\n**For the three months ended March 31, 2024:**\n\n**Branded Products**| **Recommerce**| **Total**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| $| 4,888,666| $| 9,560,291| $| 14,444,957  \nLoss from operations| $| (3,066,816| )| $| (1,870,231| )| $| (4,937,047| )  \nOther expense| $| (471,788| )| $| (190,090| )| $| (661,878| )  \nDepreciation expense| $| 306,185| $| -| $| 306,185  \nIncome tax benefit| $| 820,351| $| 681,244| $| 1,501,595  \nSegment assets:  \nAdditions to property, plant, and equipment| $| 498,448| 498,448  \nTotal assets| $| 22,418,439| $| 34,088,988| $| 56,507,427  \n  \n**For the three months ended March 31, 2023:**\n\n**Branded Products**| **Recommerce**| **Total**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| $| 4,339,750| $| 17,543,695| $| 21,883,445  \nLoss from operations| $| (1,700,804 | )| $| (432,060 | )| $| (2,132,864 | )  \nOther expense| $| (40,177 | )| $| (112,183 | )| $| (152,360 | )  \nDepreciation expense| $| 225,879| $| -| $| 225,879  \nIncome tax benefit| $| 379,689| $| 117,191| $| 496,880  \nSegment assets:  \nAdditions to property, plant, and equipment| $| 97,910| $| -| $| 97,910  \nTotal assets| $| 27,560,849| $| 36,292,218| $| 63,853,067  \n6  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \n**For the nine months ended March 31, 2024:**\n\n**Branded Products**| **Recommerce**| **Total**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| $| 15,072,684| $| 44,513,464| $| 59,586,148  \nLoss from operations| $| (5,307,384 | )| $| (2,656,263 | )| $| (7,963,647 | )  \nOther expense| $| (2,118,982 | )| $| (493,635 | )| $| (2,612,617 | )  \nDepreciation expense| $| 901,521| $| -| $| 901,521  \nIncome tax benefit| $| 1,701,208| $| 967,561| $| 2,668,769  \nSegment assets:  \nAdditions to property, plant, and equipment| $| 978,904| $| -| $| 978,904  \nTotal assets| $| 22,418,439| $| 34,088,988| $| 56,507,427  \n  \n**For the nine months ended March 31, 2023:**\n\n**Branded Products**| **Recommerce**| **Total**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| $| 12,850,078| $| 43,432,464| $| 56,282,542  \nLoss from operations| $| (5,215,259 | )| $| (693,527 | )| $| (5,908,786 | )  \nOther expense| $| (2,031,513 | )| $| (337,011 | )| $| (2,368,524 | )  \nDepreciation expense| $| 649,883| $| -| $| 649,883  \nIncome tax benefit| $| 264,656| $| 185,172| $| 449,828  \nSegment assets:  \nAdditions to property, plant, and equipment| $| 281,879| $| -| $| 281,879  \nTotal assets| $| 27,560,849| $| 36,292,218| $| 63,853,067  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe following summary of the Company’s operations should be read in conjunction with its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, which are included herein.\n\n7  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \n _**Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023**_\n\n**March 31,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nRevenue| $| 14,444,957| $| 21,883,445| $| (7,438,488 | )  \nCost of revenue| $| 11,561,834| $| 14,305,698| $| (2,743,864 | )  \nSales and marketing expenses| $| 1,547,161| $| 2,258,937| $| (711,776 | )  \nDistribution costs| $| 2,291,945| $| 2,352,684| $| (60,739 | )  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| $| 2,399,387| $| 2,602,312| $| (202,925 | )  \nOther operating expenses| $| 1,581,677| $| 2,496,678| $| (915,001 | )  \nOther expenses| $| 661,878| $| 152,360| $| 509,518  \nNet loss attributable to Upexi, Inc.| $| 4,118,612 | )| $| (1,645,939 | )| $| (2,472,673 | )  \n  \nRevenues decreased by $7,438,488 or 34% to $14,444,957 compared with revenue of $21,883,445 in the same period last year. The revenue decline was primarily the result of lower recommerce revenue through both Amazon channels and wholesale. Management made a decision to discontinue sales of electronic products in its Amazon channels after analyzing the high rate of returned products, lower margins after thirty to sixty days and the low liquidation value of Amazon returns. Branded Product sales increased slightly with increases in both the pet care products, children’s toy product and other branded products that are not heavily reliant on the Amazon sales channel. Management is focused on restructuring the Company to have more consistent sales from both product sales revenue and adding service revenue. \n\nCost of revenue decreased by $2,743,864 or 19% to $11,561,834 compared with cost of revenue of $14,305,698 in the same period last year. The cost of revenue decline was primarily related to the lower recommerce revenue. Gross profit decreased by approximately $1.7 million compared to the same period in the previous form significant write offs of inventory that was obsolete or unsellable. These products that were written off were primarily related to the recommerce business with many of them being Amazon returns or bulk products that could no longer be sold. \n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $711,776 or 32% compared with the same period in the prior year. The decreased in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to management’s efforts to refine sales strategies to focus on long-term recurring sales growth through subscription revenue and sales channel expansion. Management will continue to manage the sales and marketing expenses on branded product sales and expects the overall sales and marketing to revenue to decrease and improve profitability. \n\nDistribution costs decreased $60,739 or 3% compared with the same period in the prior year. The decrease in distribution costs was not related to sales and is expected to decrease overall as management has completed the consolidation of facilities and the distribution network at the end of June 2024. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $202,925 or 8% compared with the same period in the prior year. With the consolidation of facilities and ongoing adjustments for the sale of VitaMedica, Infusionz and Interactive Offers, management has managed the general and administrative costs and will continue to implement strategies to decrease the percentage of general and administrative costs when compared to total sales. \n\nOther operating expenses decreased by $915,001 or 37% compared with the same period in the prior year. These expenses are primarily non-cash expenses and have decreased based on the decreased amortization of stock compensation and offset by increases in depreciation. \n\n8  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had other expense of $661,878 compared to expense of $152,360 during the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the interest on debt. Management is working on eliminated this high interest debt as it restructures the Company. \n\nThe Company had a net loss of $4,118,612 compared a loss of $1,645,939 in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income is related to the decreased sales, the non-cash write off of 1.7 million in inventory and the costs associated with the distribution network until it was consolidated in June of 2024. Management expects additional administrative expenses related to the consolidation of the distribution network through June of 2024 and will then be able to recognize the improvements in fiscal year 2025. \n\n_**Nine Months Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023**_\n\n**March****31,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nRevenue| $| 59,586,148| $| 56,282,542| $| 3,303,606  \nCost of revenue| $| 42,864,857| $| 35,555,746| $| 7,309,111  \nSales and marketing expenses| $| 5,427,358| $| 5,331,948| $| 95,410  \nDistribution costs| $| 7,516,748| $| 8,010,373| $| (493,625 | )  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| $| 6,685,881| $| 6,807,739| $| (121,858 | )  \nOther operating expenses| $| 5,054,951| $| 6,485,522| $| (1,430,571 | )  \nOther expenses| $| 2,612,617| $| 2,368,524| $| 244,093  \nNet loss attributable to Upexi, Inc.| $| (7,912,919 | )| $| (1,568,180 | )| $| (6,344,739 | )  \n  \nRevenues increased by $3,303,606 or 6% to $59,586,148 compared with revenue of $56,282,542 in the same period in the prior year. The revenue growth is based on the full nine months of E-core and Luckytail revenue in the current period compared to the prior year as those two entities were acquired during the prior year. Overall, the revenue has declined in the recommerce business in both Amazon channels and wholesale channels. Branded Product sales increased slightly with increases in both the pet care products, children’s toy product and other branded products that are not heavily reliant on the Amazon sales channel. Management is focused on restructuring the Company to have more consistent sales from both product sales revenue and adding service revenue.\n\nCost of revenue increased by $7,309,111 or 21% to $42,864,857 compared with cost of revenue of $35,555,746 in the same period in the prior year. Gross profit decreased by approximately $1.8 million compared to the same period in the previous form significant write-offs of inventory that was obsolete or unsellable. These products that were written off were primarily related to the recommerce business with many of them being Amazon returns or bulk products that could no longer be sold. Management will seek to improve the gross profit and the overall gross margin in the next 12 months as we are able to leverage the consolidate our operations and restructuring management is currently in process of.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $95,410 or 10% compared with the same period in the previous year. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to the increase in the Branded Products segment, although the trend of these expenses is declining and the increase was primarily during the first two quarters of the year. Management will continue to manage the sales and marketing expenses on branded product sales and expects the overall sales and marketing to revenue to decrease and improve profitability. \n\n9  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \nDistribution costs decreased $493,625 or 6% compared with the same period in the previous year. Distribution costs are expected to continue to decrease as the consolidation efforts are completed and these operational improvements are expected to improve the Company’s profitability in fiscal year 2025. Management will continue its efforts to consolidate and streamline our distribution network and decrease the costs as a percentage of revenue.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $121,858 or 2% compared with the same period in the previous year. As the Company has consolidated the acquisitions and adjusted for the sale of Infusionz and Interactive Offers, management has controlled the general and administrative costs and will continue to implement strategies to decrease the percentage of general and administrative costs when compared to total sales. \n\nOther operating expenses decreased by $1,430,571 or 22% compared with the same period in the previous year. These expenses are primarily non-cash and decreased based on the lower amortization of stock compensation offset by increases in depreciation. \n\nDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had other expense of $2,612,617 compared to expense of $2,224,547 during the nine months ended March 31, 2023. . \n\nIn addition, during the nine months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of Interactive Offers, and an impairment on the Delray Beach facility, that was consolidated into the Tampa facility. These were offset by the gain on the lease settlement for the California facility and an income tax benefit. During the nine months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of Infusionz and select assets, which was later adjusted for lack of payment from the buyer and an income tax expense. \n\nThe Company had a net loss of $7,912,919 compared to $1,568,180 in the same period in the previous year. The decrease in net income is primarily related to the items mentioned above. \n\nWe will continue to improve the gross profit, while reducing the general and administrative expenses as compared to the sales as the Company continues to focus on sales growth while continuing to improve net income through the consolidation of operations.\n\n_**Liquidity and Capital Resources**_\n\nWorking Capital\n\n**As of****March 31,****2024**| **As of****June 30,****2023**  \n---|---  \nCurrent assets| $| 16,839,850| $| 25,455,714  \nCurrent liabilities| 24,191,784| 19,734,685  \nWorking capital| $| (7,351,934 | )| $| 5,721,029  \n10  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \nCash Flows\n\n**Nine****Months Ended March****31,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nCash flows provided by operating activities – continuing operations| $| (2,847,126 | )| $| 2,043,674  \nCash flows used in investing activities – continuing operations| (400,721 | )| (1,166,148 | )  \nCash flows used in financing activities – continuing operations| (558,877 | )| (6,836,829 | )  \nCash flows used by operating activities – discontinued operations| (187,280 | )| (190,539 | )  \nCash flows provided by (used by) investing activities – discontinued operations  \nCash flows provided by (used by) financing activities – discontinued operations  \nNet decrease in cash during the period| $| (3,994,004 | )| $| (5,968,764 | )  \n  \nOn March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $498,287, a decrease of $3,994,004 from June 30, 2023.\n\nNet cash from operating activities benefited from non-cash expenses of $4,911,405, a $2,413,987 decrease in accounts receivable, which were offset $2,775,503 paydown of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 was $400,721 and was primarily related to the $500,000 paid for the remaining 45% of Cygnet Online LLC and the acquisition of property and equipment, which was offset by the proceeds from the sale of interactive offers. The acquisition of property and equipment primarily related to equipment and leasehold improvement for the final phase of our consolidation strategy, which was completed in June 2024. \n\nNet cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, was $558,877 compared to the use of $6,836,829 during the nine months ended March 31, 2023. The cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2024 related to the repayment of notes payable and acquisition notes payable and was offset by the Company’s line of credit. \n\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2023 used by financing activities was the repayment of $7,201,079 to the line of credit, the repayment and termination of the senior convertible note and the installment payments of several other notes. The Company obtained a note from a related party and a mortgage on the building purchased in the prior year. The funds obtained were used for investing activities and the repayment of the senior convertible note. \n\nOn October 19, 2022, the Company and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Upexi 17129 Florida, LLC entered into a loan agreement with Professional Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank, providing for a mortgage on the Company’s principal office in N. Clearwater, Florida. The company received $3,000,000 in connection with the transaction. The principal is to be paid back to Professional Bank over a term of ten years. The proceeds of the loan were utilized by the Company to pay down its loan facility with Acorn Capital, LLC in the amount of $2,780,200, net of fees and other expenses. There is a contract to sell this property that would repay this loan and provided approximately $1,350,000 of working capital. \n\n11  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \nOn October 31, 2022, Upexi, Inc. (the “Company”), paid $4,275,071 in principal, $613,466 in accrued interest, $250,000 for settlement of a put option and $7,900 in miscellaneous fees for a total of $5,146,437 to the holders of the $15 million senior secured convertible notes entered into on June 28, 2022. The payment terminated the agreement with the noteholders. The Company also terminated the registration statement covering the senior secured notes payable.\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company entered into a lease agreement with MFA 2510 Merchant LLC. The lease is a for approximately 10,000 square feet of warehouse and office space, located in Odessa, Florida for $20,060 per month on a triple net basis. The initial term is five years. The estimated cost of this facility is a reduction of overall facility costs of approximately $220,000 in rent and approximately $138,000 per year in utilities, repairs and maintenance. Management also expects to have additional savings in labor and administrative costs, which is expected to add additional cash flow for fiscal year 2025. \n\nOn May 28, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Clearwater warehouse for a sale price of 4,300,000. The Company expects to receive approximately $1,350,000 after repayment of the mortgage and transaction expenses. The $1,350,000 will be used for working capital and the repayment of other outstanding debts. The transaction is expected to close on or around July 8, 2024. \n\nOn June 13, 2024, Upexi, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) pursuant to which the Company sold one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding equity (the “Interests”) of its wholly owned subsidiary VitaMedica, Inc. to three investors (the “Buyers”). One of the minority Interest Buyers is Allan Marshall, the Company’s Chief Executive Officers. The purchase price for the stock was Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000), subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. In addition, the Buyers are obligated to pay the Company for services provided according to the Transition Services Agreement. The Company estimates the fees from these services provided to VitaMedica will be approximately $300,000 annually. \n\nWe estimate that we will have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the twelve months following the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements and meet all our debt obligations.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n12  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**\n\n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of March 31, 2024 (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nIn performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses:\n\n(i)| inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and  \n---|---  \n(ii)| lack of multiple levels of supervision and review.  \n  \nWe believe the weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible. However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the appointment of additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies, by the end of our 2024 fiscal year as resources allow.\n\nWe are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the current fiscal year, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting, and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.\n\nOur management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\n**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 12a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has added significant qualified resources to ensure proper segregation of duties and proper review of the financial reporting policies and procedures.\n\n13  \n---  \n _[Table of Contents](#toc1)_  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.

As a result, the results of the business were\nclassified as discontinued operations in our condensed statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.\nF-6\nTable of Contents\nOn August 31, 2023, Upexi, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (“EIPA”) pursuant to which the Company sold one hundred percent\n(100%) of the issued and outstanding equity (the “Interests”) of its wholly owned subsidiary Interactive Offers, LLC (“Interactive”) to Amplifyir Inc.

The\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest as of March 31, 2024, and June\n30, 2023.\nIn the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a\nfair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. However, the results of\noperations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.\nDiscontinued Operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or\ngeographic area of options and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. In accordance with the rules\nregarding the presentation of discontinued operations, the assets, liabilities, and activity of Infusionz, Interactive Offers, VitaMedica and certain manufacturing business have\nbeen reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguished between assumptions based\non market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumption about the\ninputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nF-7\nTable of Contents\nASC 820 identified fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value\nhierarchy that distinguishes between the following:\nLevel 1—Quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield\ncurves.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs developed using estimates or assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.\nTo the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values, due\nto their short-term nature. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, management believed it necessary to record a reserve against the debt and equity instruments\nobtained in the sale of Infusionz of $8,500,000.\nReclassification\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, for the three and\nnine month periods ended March 31, 2023, and as of June 30, 2023 to conform to the presentation as of and for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024.\nNote 2.

Stock-based\ncompensation expense attributable to stock options was $965,229 and $3,126,472 for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024,\nthere was $330,455 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options outstanding, and the weighted average vesting period for those options was\napproximately year.\nThe value of each grant is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option model with the following assumptions for options granted during the nine months ended\nMarch31, 2024 and March 31, 2023:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2024 2023\nDividend rate - -\nRisk free interest rate 3.95% 2.07-4.06%\nExpected term 1 1\nExpected volatility 63% 70-77%\nGrant date stock price $ 1.47 $ 3.87-5.30\nThe basis for the above assumptions are as follows: the dividend rate is based upon the Company’s history of dividends; the risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected\nterm of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected term was calculated based on the Company’s historical pattern of options\ngranted and the period of time they are expected to be outstanding; and expected volatility was calculated based upon historical trends in the Company’s stock prices.\nForfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on historical experience of\nforfeitures, the Company estimated forfeitures at 0% for each of the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nNote 13. Income Taxes\nThe Company computed the year-to-date income tax provision by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to the year-to-date pre-tax income and adjusted for discrete\ntax items in the period. The Company’s income tax benefit was $1,501,595 and $2,668,769 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, and $496,880 and\n$449,828 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe income tax expense for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to federal and state income taxes and nondeductible expenses for an\neffective tax rate of approximately 29%. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax\nrate is due to the full valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets.\nFuture realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income\nwithin the carryforward period. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative.\nThe Company also considered whether there was any currently available information about future years. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the\nCompany will have future taxable income to fully realize the Company’s deferred tax asset.\nAs of March 31, 2024, there was approximately $10,472,757 of losses available to reduce federal taxable income in future years and can be carried forward indefinitely.\nNote 14. Risks and Uncertainties\nThere is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics, and businesses as to the scope of\noperation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of\ncannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant\ncultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation\nor a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in\ndifferent markets.\nNote 15.

The revenue decline was primarily the result of\nlower recommerce revenue through both Amazon channels and wholesale. Management made a decision to discontinue sales of electronic products in its Amazon channels\nafter analyzing the high rate of returned products, lower margins after thirty to sixty days and the low liquidation value of Amazon returns. Branded Product sales increased\nslightly with increases in both the pet care products, children’s toy product and other branded products that are not heavily reliant on the Amazon sales channel.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.\n12\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”), as of March 31, 2024 (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting\nofficer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ncontrol deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses:\n(i) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and\n(ii) lack of multiple levels of supervision and review.\nWe believe the weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and\nnature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible. However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the\ndesign of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material\nweaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the appointment of additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties\nand implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies, by the end of our 2024 fiscal year as resources allow.\nWe are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the current fiscal year, including\nidentifying specific areas within our governance, accounting, and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.\nOur management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing\nbasis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only\nreasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 12a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has added significant\nqualified resources to ensure proper segregation of duties and proper review of the financial reporting policies and procedures.\n13\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

While neither the FDCA nor FDA has specific provisions that relate to the marketing of hemp\nproducts, the products are subject to the general adulteration and labeling provisions of the FDCA and FDA’s regulations depending on whether the product is marketed as a\ncosmetic, dietary supplement or food. The permissibility of hemp products containing cannabinoids remains in a state of flux. The FDA has issued guidance titled “FDA\nRegulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including Cannabidiol (CBD)” pursuant to which the FDA has taken the position that cannabidiol (“CBD”) is\nprohibited from use as an ingredient in a food or beverage or as a dietary ingredient in or as a dietary supplement based on several provisions of the FDCA. In the definition of\n“dietary supplement” found in the FDCA at Section 201(ff), an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical\ninvestigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement. A similar\nprovision in the FDCA at 301(ll) makes it a prohibited act to introduce or deliver into commerce any food with a substance that was investigated as a new drug prior to being\nincluded in a food. There are no similar exclusions for the use of CBD in non-drug topical products, as long as such products otherwise comply with applicable laws. The FDA\ncreated a task force to address the further regulation of CBD and other cannabis-derived products and is currently evaluating the applicable science and pathways for regulating\nCBD and other cannabis-derived ingredients. Additionally, various states have enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD\nand other hemp products. Compliance with state-specific laws and regulations could impact our operations in those specific states. It is important to note that FDA has not taken\nany specific positions regarding the regulatory status of other cannabinoids, for example CBDA, CBDG, and CBDN. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission is the agency that\nis vested with ensuring that all marketing claims for hemp products are truthful and non-misleading.\n9\nTable of Contents\nOur Products\nUpexi is a multi-faceted brand owner with established brands in the health, wellness, pet, beauty and other growing markets. We operate in emerging industries with high\ngrowth trends and look to drive organic growth of our current brands. We focus on direct to consumer and Amazon brands that are scalable and have anticipated, high industry\ngrowth trends. Our goal is to continue to accumulate consumer data and build out a significant customer database across all industries we sell into. The growth of our current\ncustomer database has been key to the year-over-year gains in sales and profits. To drive additional growth, we have and will continue to acquire profitable Amazon and\neCommerce businesses that can scale quickly and reduce costs through corporate synergies. We utilize our in-house SaaS programmatic ad technology to help achieve a lower\ncost per acquisition and accumulate consumer data for increased cross-selling between our growing portfolio of brands.\nThe global ecommerce growth rate for 2022 is forecast at 12.2 percent, bringing global eCommerce sales worldwide to $5.542 trillion. Online shopping trends are\nexpected to grow 50 percent in the U.S. in the next few years. eCommerce sales are forecast to increase by a whopping 50 percent from $907.9 billion in 2022 to $1.4 trillion in\n2025. The industry saw exponential growth during the pandemic, as consumers were more apt to buy online than go into stores, but while the CAGR has dipped from 2020, the\nindustry continues to grow steadily.\nThe market, customers and distribution methods for eCommerce products are large and diverse. While Amazon remains the largest eCommerce channel, others are\ncarving out a big chunk of the market, including Walmart, eBay, and Etsy. More opportunities are popping up for sellers as well. Being able to navigate multiple marketplaces is\na key to our success and helps reach different demographics and consumers with specific buying behaviors.\nEach of our brands creates new opportunities for us to target additional markets and consumers. Our goal through this diverse portfolio is to create products that can be\ncross-sold between brands to help take advantage of our growing list of consumer data.\nOur target customers are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales; however, we see growth opportunities in direct-to-consumer retail stores, cooperatives,\naffiliate sales and master distributors. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer\nand regulatory developments.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe attribute our success to our diverse portfolio of consumer products.\nDiversification of Product Offerings. As an aggregator, our research and development team carefully tracks the growth rates for various consumer products, which\nserves as the first means of identifying profitable brands that have significant opportunities for scale. While many companies continue to spend on growth at all costs, we have\nspent to increase our profitability and build a foundation for profits in the toughest of times. We remained patient when other aggregators were over-extending their means\nwhich has provided us for better opportunities at more favorable valuations.\nAdvertising Technology. We understand that advertising and consumer data is the key to growth when it comes to any eCommerce business. Our investment in such\ntechnology helps lower our advertising costs, while providing a revenue stream from others who we outsource this programmatic SAAS to. This ownership of data allows us to\nhelp cross-sell any brand we acquire or launch.\nLogistical Expertise. Our executive team comes from a background in logistics, with CEO, Allan Marshall, the founder of XPO Logistics (formerly known as\nSegmentz, Inc.). With increased shipping costs affecting online retailers, our strength is understanding this and finding ways to lower our costs and overhead, thus increasing\nprofit margins on all of our products.\nLiquidation Markets. Resellers on and off Amazon represent a significant part of our business, which allows us to use our capital to buy in bulk with quick resale\nopportunities, whether it be direct Amazon listings or through partnerships with the likes of Walmart, BJ’s, Costco, Sam’s Club, etc. As a result, we are able to expand our\nnetwork, build new relationships, and sell branded products without the added cost of advertising.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRetail Partnerships. While eCommerce is our direct line of business, we have grown and continue to expand our relationships with big box retailers in order to sell\nbranded products as resellers or to place our in-house brands in those stores. With longstanding accounts that we have taken ownership of through acquisitions, we have grown\nour network and have untapped additional revenue streams.\nProfessionalism and Entrepreneurial Culture. Our professionalism and entrepreneurial culture fosters highly dedicated employees who provide our customers with\nunsurpassed customer service. We continue to invest in our talent by providing every employee with an extensive and ongoing education and have successfully developed\nprograms that provide comprehensive product knowledge and the tools needed to have a unique understanding of our customers’ personalities and decision-making processes.\nExperienced and Proven Management Team Driving Growth through Organic and Accretive Acquisition Opportunities. We believe our management team has\nextensive experience in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in accounting, mergers and acquisitions, financial services, consumer packaged goods,\nretail operations and third-party logistics.\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur growth will focus on the expansion of our brand portfolio through organic growth and strategic acquisitions.\nDirect-to-Consumer expansion. Our direct-to-consumer business is expected to be our growth driver for the next several years, driven by acquisitions of profitable\nAmazon and eCommerce businesses. This allows us to tap into multiple markets and helps us acquire proven brands that are at a stage in their lifecycle when they lack the\nresources (capital and personnel) to grow rapidly on their own. Our model helps inject those resources into the business in hopes to scale the business efficiently.\nResellers & liquidators. While direct-to-consumer brands represent a major part of our growth, our company has realized the potential of acquiring profitable resellers\nwho sell on/to Amazon, Walmart, Costco, BJ’s, Sam’s Club, and more. Our first acquisition in the space, Cygnet Online, sells branded OTC products on Amazon. A letter of\nintent was signed on August 2, 2022 for the acquisition of E-Core, Inc. and its subsidiaries to further expand this segment of our business. We believe this is a lucrative industry\nthat also helps establish strong, big box retail partnerships.\nTalent acquisition. A large part of our acquisition process is to not only evaluate the brand/product offerings, but to understand the team that has been responsible for its\nsuccess. In a tough market for hiring, this has proven to be a strategic method for bringing on talent. We not only get a great brand, but look to retain the personnel, often the\nheartbeat of said brand, give them resources, and even utilize them for other brands that we have launched internally or acquired. We strongly believe that continued success\nrelies on a growing team of experts across various industries.\nAdvertising technology. With online sales increasing, so has the cost of advertising. Our in-house, programmatic advertising technology, Interactive Offers, not only\nacts as a revenue stream for our business, but provides us with endless research, consumer data, and allows us to achieve lower advertising costs for our brands. The business\nhas a growing list of publishers and advertisers who also utilize our technology to monetize their data, achieve better CPMs, and even increase their average order values.\nInternational expansion. Our primary focus has been on the U.S. eCommerce market which, as mentioned, is forecasted to grow stronger than others. However, with\nrecently acquired brands and their presence in international markets, we expect nearly all of our products to be offered worldwide over the next few years.\nAcquiring aggregators. The aggregation craze took off in 2019 to 2020, but many found themselves overpaying for brands and not being able to support the growth\nthey had forecasted. Recently, these aggregators have been looking for funding and/or selling their assets. We seek to take advantage of this opportunity to bring on additional\nbrands and talent that, for better or worse, were overwhelmed and unprepared.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nThere is heavy competition in the aggregation market, but each company seems to be trying to carve their own niche in the space. We compete against several national and\ninternational companies, most of which have substantially greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known and funded, private companies.\nOur goal is never to compete against these aggregators, but to do our own research, focus on profitability, and grow efficiently, rather than overextend ourselves and pay up for\nvaluations that don’t make sense.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas, including, but not\nlimited to, the hemp business in the United States, the consumer products and nutritional supplement markets in the United States, consumer protection, labor, intellectual\nproperty ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, federal and state healthcare, environmental and safety. The successful execution of our business\nobjectives will be contingent upon our compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, permits and registrations, which\nmay be onerous and expensive. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in such applicable laws and regulations and the expansion of the Company’s\nbusiness, could make our products less attractive to our customers, delay the introduction of new products, and require the Company to implement policies and procedures\ndesigned to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe operate our business in markets that are both highly regulated and rapidly evolving. We are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations affecting the\nmanufacturing, packaging, labeling and sale of food, beverages, dietary supplements, and personal care products/cosmetics, as well as the use of hemp and hemp-derived\ningredients like CBD in such products. The FDA regulates hemp and hemp-derived ingredients in FDA-regulated products pursuant to the provisions of the FDCA and\nregulations promulgated pursuant to it, in particular those related to adulteration and labeling of cosmetic, food, and dietary supplements. The FDA has issued guidance on the\nsubject and issued letters to companies regarding claims made for products and the use of such ingredients in various products. The FDA also initiated a task force to evaluate\npathways for further regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients. At various times, bills pertaining to the regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients have been\nintroduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and additional proposed legislation is expected to be introduced in the future to clarify the regulatory\nstatus of cannabinoids from hemp generally and CBD generally. Future legislation approved by Congress and signed by the President, or rulemaking promulgated by the FDA,\ncould either positively or adversely impact the future sale of products by the Company.\nWe are currently not subject to any foreign regulations as we do not currently distribute or export any products, including hemp or CBD related products outside the U.S.\nAdditionally, we are not aware of any foreign regulations that we had to comply with in regard to the sale of our flavoring products to one end user customer in the U.S. who\ndistributed such products to Europe where it had operations. The responsibility for compliance with any European regulations would be on such customer.\nAdditionally, numerous states have passed forms of hemp legislation governing the cultivation of hemp, as well as the further processing and sale of hemp and products with\nhemp or hemp-derived ingredients. Those states that have not yet enacted laws or issued regulations pertaining to hemp and hemp-derived ingredients may do so in the near\nfuture. Unless Congress specifically enacts laws preempting the state regulations of hemp products, we will continue to be subject not only to federal law but various state laws.\nPresently, Upexi and only distributes hemp-products in states that it is legal to do so. Changes in the state laws and regulations could again either positively or adversely affect\nour ability to sell products in those states.\nEmployees\nThe Company has 95 full-time employees working out of its headquarters in Tampa Florida, its Henderson, Nevada, manufacturing facility, its offices and distribution\nwarehouses in Southern Florida or individuals’ home-based offices.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\nYou are advised to read this Form 10-K in conjunction with other reports and documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. You may obtain copies of these reports\ndirectly from us or from the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F. Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549, and you may obtain information about obtaining access\nto the Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains information for electronic filers at its website http://www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other\ninformation set forth in this Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of\nyour investment in our common stock. See also “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business prospects and management.\nThe Company was incorporated on September 5, 2018 and only commenced operations thereafter. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which to base an\nevaluation of our business and prospects. Operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we cannot assure you that the Company will achieve or\nsustain profitability in the future.\nThe Company’s prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly\nevolving markets. Future operating results will depend upon many factors, including our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, our ability to\nestablish short term credit lines or obtain financing from other sources, such as this Offering, our ability to develop and market new products, our ability to control costs, and\ngeneral economic conditions. We cannot assure you that the Company will successfully address any of these risks. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful\nor that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain appropriate intellectual property protection in the United States and foreign countries with\nrespect to our proprietary formulations and products. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends on our ability to build and maintain brand recognition\nusing trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other intellectual property. We may rely on trade secret, trademark, patent and copyright laws, and confidentiality and other\nagreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken and the steps we will take to protect our proprietary rights may\nnot be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property\nare unsuccessful or inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business and prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. Protecting against unauthorized use of our\ntrademarks and other intellectual property rights may be expensive, difficult and in some cases not possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party\ninfringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to effectively manage growth.\nAs we continue to grow our business and develop products, we expect to need additional research, development, managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, accounting,\nlegal and other resources. The Company expects its growth to place a substantial strain on its managerial, operational and financial resources. The Company cannot assure that\nit will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations, or that its facilities, systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support its operations. The\nCompany’s inability to manage future growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management may not be able to control costs in an effective or timely manner.\nThe Company’s management has made reasonable efforts to assess, predict and control costs and expenses. However, the Company only has a brief operating history upon\nwhich to base those efforts. Implementing our business plan may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than management has\npredicted. Likewise, the cost of compensating employees and consultants or other operating costs may be higher than management’s estimates, which could lead to sustained\nlosses.\nWe expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate.\nWe expect our net sales and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including changes in:\n· Demand for our products;\n· Our ability to obtain and retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;\n· Our ability to manage our product inventory;\n· General economic conditions, both domestically and in foreign markets;\n· Advertising and other marketing costs; and\n· Costs of creating and expanding product lines.\nAs a result of the variability of these and other factors, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of our stockholders.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of U.S. federal securities laws, which can be expensive.\nWe will be subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The\ncosts of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited financial statements to stockholders will\ncause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we had remained privately held. In addition, it may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and\nimplement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other\nfinance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nCybersecurity breaches of our IT systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers, delay our ability\nto recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation,\nexpose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.\nWe increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our\nmarketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security, or that of our\nwebsite, and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service. Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage\nnetworks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. In addition, sophisticated hardware and\noperating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems\nthat could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third-party contractors, including our\nmanufacturers and logistics providers, and our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of our contractors’ own cybersecurity measures. Similarly, we rely upon\ndistributors, resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend, in part, on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures. Additionally, we\ndepend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to\nsecurity breaches and the loss of data. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated\ncyberattacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur significant costs and require significant management resources to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, and any failure to comply or any adverse result from such evaluation may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we will be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section\n404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) and to include an internal control report beginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June\n30, 2022. This report must include management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report must\nalso include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. Failure to comply, or any adverse results from such\nevaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could harm our business.\nWe may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such an increase or supply interruption could materially\nnegatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum. The prices for these raw\nmaterials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. Substantial increases in\nthe prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased prices for our products.\nOur failure to meet the continuing listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our securities.\nIf, after this offering, we fail to satisfy the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ, such as the corporate governance, stockholders’ equity or minimum closing bid price\nrequirements, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair\nyour ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would likely take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ’s\nlisting requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or\nimprove the liquidity of our securities, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with\nNASDAQ’s listing requirements.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely\naffect our operating results.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company\nreporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules\nimplemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ. In addition, our management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a\npublic company. We expect complying with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more\ntime-consuming and costly.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our\nbusiness or increase the prices of our products. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a public company, we also expect that it may be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept\nreduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain\nqualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nWe are eligible to be treated as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and a “smaller reporting company” within the meaning of the Securities Act,\nand we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock\nless attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions\nfrom various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the\nauditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this annual report and our\nperiodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of\nany golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial\nstatements and two years of selected financial data in this annual report. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us\nto lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any December 31 before that time or if we have\ntotal annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, after which, in each case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of\nthe following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging\ngrowth company immediately.\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced\ndisclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of\nthe fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior the end of our second fiscal quarter\nending December 31 of each year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-\naffiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior to the end of our second fiscal quarter ending December 31 of each year. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced\ndisclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nAfter we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements\napplicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, and if we are unable to compete with our competitors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows\nand prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competition includes all other companies that are in the business of producing or distributing hemp-based products for\npersonal use or consumption. Many of our competitors have greater resources that may enable them to compete more effectively than us in the CBD industry. Some of our\ncompetitors have a longer operating history and greater capital resources, facilities and product line diversity, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this\nmarket. Our competitors may devote their resources to developing and marketing products that will directly compete with our product lines. The Company expects to face\nadditional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants. If a significant number of new entrants enters the market in the near term, the Company may\nexperience increased competition for market share and may experience downward pricing pressure on the Company’s products as new entrants increase production. Such\ncompetition may cause us to encounter difficulties in generating revenues and market share, and in positioning our products in the market. If we are unable to successfully\ncompete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, our lack of competitive advantage will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\n16\nTable of Contents\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products or similar products developed and distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on our\nreputation, which could result in decreased sales and fluctuations in our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on consumer perception regarding the safety and quality of our products, as well as similar products marketed and distributed by other companies. Consumer\nperception of hemp-based products can be significantly influenced by adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, national media attention or other publicity,\nwhich may associate consumption of our products or other similar products with adverse effects or question the benefits and/or effectiveness of our products or similar products.\nA new product may initially be received favorably, resulting in high sales of that product, but that level of sales may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change over\ntime. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or any of our particular products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or\npublicity. Unfavorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales.\nOur failure to appropriately and timely respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our customer relationships and\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Our failure to accurately predict or react to these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of us as\na source for the latest products, which in turn could harm our customer relationships and cause us to lose market share. The success of our product offerings depends upon a\nnumber of factors, including our ability to:\n· Anticipate customer needs;\n· Innovate and develop new products;\n· Successfully introduce new products in a timely manner;\n· Price our products competitively with retail and online competitors;\n· Deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n· Differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments and partnerships could be difficult to identify and integrate with our business, disrupt our business, and adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe may seek to acquire or invest in businesses and product lines that we believe could complement or expand our product offerings, or otherwise offer growth opportunities.\nThe pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable\nacquisitions, whether or not the acquisitions are completed. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could\nadversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, if an acquired business or product line fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFailure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and their products and other assets into our Company, or if integrated, failure to further our business strategy, may\nresult in our inability to realize any benefit from such acquisition.\nWe expect to grow by acquiring relevant businesses, including other cannabis-related businesses. The consummation and integration of any acquired business, product or other\nassets into our Company may be complex and time consuming and, if such businesses and assets are not successfully integrated, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits,\ncost-savings or growth opportunities. Furthermore, these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as\nanticipated, expose our Company to increased competition or other challenges with respect to our products or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities\nassociated with an acquired business, technology or other asset or arrangement.\nThe failure to attract and retain key employees could hurt our business.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain numerous highly qualified employees. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key\nemployees or consultants could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We face competition for personnel and consultants from\nother companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Our failure to attract and retain skilled management and\nemployees may prevent or delay us from pursuing certain opportunities. If we fail to successfully fill many management roles, fail to fully integrate new members of our\nmanagement team, lose the services of key personnel, or fail to attract additional qualified personnel, it will be significantly more difficult for us to achieve our growth strategies\nand success.\nWe have limited supply sources, and price increases or supply shortages of key raw materials could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOur products are composed of certain key raw materials. If the prices of such raw materials increase significantly, it could result in a significant increase in our product\ndevelopment costs. If raw material prices increase in the future, we may not be able to pass on such price increases to our customers. A significant increase in the price of raw\nmaterials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its continued success will depend upon the availability of raw materials that permit the Company to meet its labeling claims and quality control\nstandards. The supply of our industrial hemp is subject to the same risks normally associated with agricultural production, such as climactic conditions, insect infestations and\navailability of manual labor or equipment for harvesting. Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could substantially increase the cost of such\nmaterials, could require product reformulations, the qualification of new suppliers and repackaging and could result in a substantial reduction or termination by the Company of\nits sales of certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the disruption of the Company’s\nsupply sources will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nLoss of key contracts with our suppliers, renegotiation of such agreements on less favorable terms or other actions these third parties may take could harm our business.\nMost of our agreements with suppliers of our industrial hemp, including our key supplier contract, are short term. The loss of these agreements, or the renegotiation of these\nagreements on less favorable economic or other terms, could limit our ability to procure raw material to manufacture our products. This could negatively affect our ability to\nmeet consumer demand for our products. Upon expiration or termination of these agreements, our competitors may be able to secure industrial hemp from our existing suppliers\nwhich will put the company at a competitive disadvantage in the market.\n18\nTable of Contents\nLoss of key customers could harm our business.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, a significant portion of our sales were to two large customers, but we do not have contracts for future purchases in place with either of these\ncustomers. As such, we do not have any purchase commitments from these customers, and there can be no assurance that they will continue to purchase our products. If these\ncustomers do not purchase our products in the future, and we are not able to generate a similar volume of sales from other customers, it could have a material effect on our total\nsales and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.\nThere is limited availability of clinical studies.\nAlthough hemp plants have a long history of human consumption, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these innovative product\ningredients or combinations thereof in concentrated form. Although the Company performs research and/or tests the formulation and production of its products, there is limited\nclinical data regarding the safety and benefits of ingesting industrial hemp-based products. Any instance of illness or negative side effects of ingesting industrial hemp-based\nproducts would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe face substantial risk of product liability claims and potential adverse product publicity.\nLike any other retailer, distributor or manufacturer of products that are designed to be ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action\nand litigation if our products are alleged to have caused loss or injury. In the event we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liability claims\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is not currently a named defendant in any product liability lawsuit; however, other manufacturers and\ndistributors of hemp-based products currently are or have been named as defendants in such lawsuits. The successful assertion or settlement of any uninsured claim, a\nsignificant number of insured claims, or a claim exceeding the Company’s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain independent distributors for our products.\nAs a direct selling company, our revenue depends in part upon the number and productivity of our independent distributors. Like most direct selling companies, we experience\nhigh levels of turnover among our independent distributors from year to year, who may terminate their service at any time. Generally, we need to increase the productivity of\nour independent distributors and/or retain existing independent distributors and attract additional independent distributors to maintain and/or increase product sales. Many\nfactors affect our ability to attract and retain independent distributors, including the following:\n· publicity regarding our Company, our products, our distribution channels and our competitors;\n· public perceptions regarding the value and efficacy of our products;\n· ongoing motivation of our independent distributors;\n· government regulations;\n· general economic conditions;\n· our compensation arrangements, training and support for our independent distributors; and\n· competition in the market.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if our independent distributors are unable to maintain their current levels of\nproductivity, or if we are unable to retain existing distributors and attract new distributors in sufficient numbers to maintain present sales levels and sustain future growth.\nWe could incur obligations resulting from the activities of our independent distributors.\nWe sell our products through a network of independent distributors. Independent distributors are independent contractors who operate their own business separate and apart\nfrom the Company. We may not be able to control certain aspects of our distributors’ activities that may impact our business. If local laws and regulations, or the interpretation\nthereof, change and require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or if our independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety\nof obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including employment-related taxes and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the possibility that some jurisdictions may seek to hold us responsible for false product or earnings-related\nclaims due to the actions of our independent distributors. Liability for any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf our independent distributors’ failure to comply with applicable advertising laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe advertisement of our products is subject to extensive regulations in the markets in which we do business. Our independent distributors may fail to comply with such\nregulations governing the advertising of our products. We cannot ensure that all marketing materials used by our independent distributors comply with applicable regulations,\nincluding bans on false or misleading product and earnings-related claims. If our independent distributors fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subjected to\nclaims of false advertising, misrepresentation, significant financial penalties, and/or costly mandatory product recalls and relabeling requirements with respect to our products,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the CBD Industry\nLaws and regulations affecting the CBD industry are evolving under the Farm Bill, and changes to applicable regulations may materially affect our future operations in\nthe CBD market.\nThe CBD used by the Company is derived from hemp as defined in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (United States) (the “Farm Bill “) and codified at 7 USC 1639o\nmeans “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers,\nwhether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” The Cannabis sativa plant and its derivatives\nmay also be deemed marijuana, depending on certain factors. “Marijuana” is a Schedule I controlled substance and is defined in the Federal Controlled Substances Act at 21\nUSC Section 802(16) as “all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every\ncompound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin.” Exemptions to that definition provided in 21 USC Section 802(16) include\n“the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or\npreparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination” or hemp as\ndefined in 7 USC 1639o.\nSubstances meeting the definition of “hemp” in the Farm Bill and 7 USC 1639o may be used in clinical studies and research through an Investigational New Drug (“IND”)\napplication with the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Substances scheduled as controlled substances, like marijuana, require more rigorous regulation, including\ninteraction with several agencies including the FDA, the DEA, and the NIDA within the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”).\nAccordingly, if the CBD used by the Company is deemed marijuana and, therefore, a Schedule I controlled substance, the Company could be subject to significant additional\nregulation, as well as enforcement actions and penalties pertaining to the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and any resulting liability could require the Company to modify or\ncease its operations.\nFurthermore, in conjunction with the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD use in food and dietary supplements, noting that the Farm Bill explicitly\npreserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and\nSection 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Any difficulties we experience in complying with existing and/or new government regulation could increase our operating costs\nand adversely impact our results of operations in future periods. The FDA has issued guidance titled “FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including\nCannabidiol (CBD)” pursuant to which the FDA has taken the position that CBD is prohibited from use as an ingredient in a food or beverage or as a dietary ingredient in or as\na dietary supplement based on several provisions of the FDCA. In the definition of “dietary supplement” found in the FDCA at 201(ff), an article authorized for investigation as\na new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, is\nexcluded from the definition of dietary supplement. A similar provision in the FDCA 301(ll) makes it a prohibited act to introduce or deliver into commerce any food with a\nsubstance that was investigated as a new drug prior to being included in a food. There are no similar exclusions for the use of CBD in non-drug topical products, as long as such\nproducts otherwise comply with applicable laws. The FDA created a task force to address the further regulation of CBD and other cannabis-derived products and is currently\nevaluating the applicable science and pathways for regulating CBD and other cannabis-derived ingredients.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the Farm Bill’s recent passage, we expect that there will be a constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the CBD industry which could affect the\nCompany’s plan of operations. Local, state and federal hemp laws and regulations may be broad in scope and subject to changing interpretations. These changes may require us\nto incur substantial costs associated with legal compliance and may ultimately require us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations of these laws, or alleged violations,\ncould disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications,\nand it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business.\nChanges to state laws pertaining to industrial hemp could slow the use of industrial hemp, which could impact our revenues in future periods. Approximately 40 states have\nauthorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the Farm Bill. Additionally, various states have enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling,\nand sale of CBD and other hemp products. Compliance with state-specific laws and regulations could impact our operations in those specific states. Continued development of\nthe industrial hemp industry will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp at the state level, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation\nat the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp industry is currently\nencouraging, growth is not assured, and while there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the\nlegislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests.\nUnfavorable interpretations of laws governing hemp processing activities could subject us to enforcement or other legal proceedings and limit our business and prospects.\nThere are no express protections in the United States under applicable federal or state law for possessing or processing hemp biomass derived from lawful hemp not exceeding\n0.3% THC on a dry weight basis and intended for use in finished product, but that may temporarily exceed 0.3% THC during the interim processing stages. While it is a\ncommon occurrence for hemp biomass to have variance in THC content during interim processing stages after cultivation but prior to use in finished products, there is risk that\nstate or federal regulators or law enforcement could take the position that such hemp biomass is a Schedule I controlled substance in violation of the CSA and similar state laws.\nIn the event that the Company’s operations are deemed to violate any laws, the Company could be subject to enforcement actions and penalties, and any resulting liability could\ncause the Company to modify or cease its operations.\nCosts associated with compliance with various laws and regulations could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe manufacture, labeling and distribution of CBD products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory\nor legal proceedings, which could restrict our ability to market CBD-based products in the future. The FDA regulates our products to ensure that the products are not adulterated\nor misbranded. We may also be subject to regulation by other federal, state and local agencies with respect to our CBD-based products. Our advertising activities are subject to\nregulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC and state attorneys general have initiated numerous investigations of dietary and\nnutritional supplement companies and products. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or\nprivate litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe shifting regulatory environment necessitates building and maintaining of robust systems to achieve and maintain compliance in multiple jurisdictions and increases the\npossibility that we may violate one or more of the legal requirements applicable to our business and products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable\nlaws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,\ninjunctions, or product withdrawals, recalls or seizures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty caused by potential changes to legal regulations could impact the use and acceptance of CBD products.\nThere is substantial uncertainty and differing interpretations and opinions among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the\nscope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids and the Controlled Substances Act. These different opinions\ninclude, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the DEA and/or the FDA, and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant\ncultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The existing uncertainties in the CBD regulatory landscape in the United States cannot be resolved without\nfurther federal, and perhaps state-level, legislation and regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing laws and regulations. If these uncertainties are not resolved in\nthe near future or are resolved in the manner inconsistent with our business plan, such uncertainties may have an adverse effect upon our plan of operations and the introduction\nof our CBD-based products in different markets.\nIf we fail to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals under applicable laws and regulations, our business and plan of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses and regulatory approvals in the jurisdictions where we sell or plan to sell our products. There can be no\nassurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any necessary licenses, permits or approvals. Any material delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, such licenses, permits\nand approvals is likely to delay and/or inhibit our ability to carry out our plan of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nPotential future international expansion of our business could expose us to additional regulatory risks and compliance costs.\nAlthough we have no plans to expand internationally for at least two or more years, if the Company intends to expand internationally or engage in the international sale of its\nproducts, it will become subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates, or in which it imports or exports products or materials, including, but\nnot limited to, customs regulations in the importing and exporting countries. The varying laws and rapidly changing regulations may impact the Company’s operations and\nability to ensure compliance. In addition, the Company may avail itself of proposed legislative changes in certain jurisdictions to expand its product portfolio, which expansion\nmay include unknown business and regulatory compliance risks. Failure by the Company to comply with the evolving regulatory framework in any jurisdiction could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for health and wellness products is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively in the market, our business and operating results could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nThe market for CBD products is a competitive and rapidly evolving market. There are numerous competitors in the industry, some of whom are more well-established with\nlonger operating histories and greater financial resources than the Company. We expect competition to continue to intensify following the recent passage of the Farm Bill. We\nbelieve the Company will be able to compete effectively because of the quality of our products and customer service. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will\neffectively compete with existing or future competitors. Increased competition may also drive the prices of our products down, which may have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations in future periods.\n22\nTable of Contents\nGiven the rapid changes affecting the global, national and regional economies generally, the Company may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining a competitive\nadvantage in the marketplace. The Company’s success will depend on our ability to keep pace with any changes in such markets, especially legal and regulatory changes. Our\nsuccess will depend on our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond\nadequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 1B.

Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The Company is not\ninvolved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation, and, to the best of its knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or\nto which any of our properties are subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nItem 4.

(“2023 acquisitions”) during 2023 and $18,848,230 or 33% was related to the acquisitions of\nCygnet Online, LLC and VitaMedica, Inc. (“2022 acquisitions”) compared to the prior year period. This was offset by a decline in other businesses of $2,278,475 or 4%. Our\nprimary brands of VitaMedica, LuckyTail and newly acquired Tytan Tiles all had significant growth year over year and management will continue to focus on these high margin\nand growth potential business in 2024 and beyond. The recommerce businesses, E-Core Technology, Inc. and Cygnet Online, LLC, continue to represent a significant portion\nof the overall revenue of the Company, although we did see lower than expected sales volume from our Amazon sales channels. Management expects revenue to continue to\nincrease in the 2024 fiscal year with a primary focus on growing our branded products.\nCost of revenue increased by $38,922,455 or 475% compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. $31,144,149 or 80% of the increase was related to the 2023 acquisitions\nand $8,640,033 or 22% was related to the 2022 acquisitions. The gross profit increased by $18,688,710. The gross profit margin declined by 22% to 42% compared to 64% in\nthe prior year. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily related to the sales from the recommerce business versus the sales of our branded products. Management\nexpects the gross margin to improve as the branded products segment continues to grow as a percentage of the overall sales and as we continue to gain economies of scale in our\npurchasing of products.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $5,259,135 or 103% compared with the same period last year. $2,396,876 or 46% of the increase was related to the 2023\nacquisitions and $1,373,733 or 26% was related to the 2022 acquisitions. There was an increase of $1,488,526 or 28% related to the other business. The increase in sales and\nmarketing expenses was primarily related to the acquisitions and increased expenditures for brand and company awareness, however management has aligned the marketing\nexpenditures with the expected growth strategy to decrease the overall percentage of sales and marketing costs to sales. We anticipate our advertising expenses will continue to\nfluctuate in the following quarters as we fully implement our overall brand marketing strategy.\nDistribution costs increased $10,155,581 or 459% compared with the same period last year. $1,850,306 or 18% of the increase was related to the 2023 acquisitions and\n$7,306,309 or 72% of the increase was related to the 2022 acquisitions and the rest of the business. There continue to be increases in transportation costs and third-party\nprovider rates. Management has implemented a strategy to change promotions, increase prices and adjust packaging to decrease the overall percentage of distribution costs to\nsales and is in process of consolidating its distribution centers, including closing the California facility as of July 1, 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $404,521 or 4% compared with the same period last year. General and administrative expenses increased by $2,332,690\nfrom 2023 acquisitions with the remainder of the business had a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1,928,169. Management has actively been reducing general\nand administrative costs by consolidation of administrative functions and capitalizing on the overall size of the Company. Management will continue to implement strategies to\ndecrease the percentage of general and administrative costs when compared to total sales.\nOther operating expenses increased by $3,932,350 or 80% compared with the same period last year. These expenses are primarily non-cash and increase based on the intangible\nassets created with acquisitions and the continued amortization of stock compensation. $1,612,815 or 41% was related to the 2023 acquisitions amortization of acquired\nintangible assets and $1,616,188 or 41% of the increase was related to the 2022 acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets. The remaining increase of $703,347 was\nrelated to increases in stock-based compensation and depreciation.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOther expenses increased by $11,020,570, which was primarily the loss recognized on the sale of Infusionz and select CBD assets, the reserves against amounts owed to the\nCompany by the buyers of that business, the impairment of Interactive Offers intangible assets and an increase of interest expense from both acquisition debt and the\ntermination of a $15,000,000 senior secured debt facility on October 1, 2022. Management estimates based on the current and expected debt balances in fiscal year 2024 that\ninterest expense will be less than $2,800,000 and cash paid for interest expense to be less than $1,400,000.\nThe Company had a net loss of $16,930,289 compared to a net loss of $2,100,850 in the prior year. The decrease in the net losses primarily related to the above-mentioned\nchanges, which was offset by the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of our consolidated subsidiary.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company’s financial reporting is organized into two segments: Our Branded Product segment and our Recommerce segment. Our Branded Product segment is focused on\nthe development, growth and distribution of the branded products that we own. Our Recommerce segment is focused on the purchase and sale of new and used products\nthrough channels such as Amazon and wholesale distributors.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we\nevaluate these estimates, including those related to bad debts, intangible assets, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe have identified below the accounting policies, related to what we believe are most critical to our business operations and are discussed throughout Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition or Plan of Operation where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates underlying the Company’s reported financial position and results of operations include the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and\nequipment, impairment of long-lived assets, inventory valuation, fair value of stock-based compensation and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the\naggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Company to the seller’s cash consideration and equity instruments issued.\nTransaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net\nassets of the acquiree is recorded as identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\nGoodwill - The Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment, simplifying the test for goodwill Impairment at least annually and when one or more triggering events\nor circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not\nto exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company performed its annual test as of June 30, 2023. No impairment charge was identified in connection with the annual goodwill impairment test\nRevenue Recognition - The Company analyzes its contracts and purchase orders to assess that revenue is properly recognized. In determining the appropriate amount of\nrevenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, whether for goods and services or licensing, the Company performs the following\nsteps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including\nwhether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance\nobligation. The Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as the Company is the primary obligor in the transactions. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue\nfor its products when ownership is transferred to the customer, provided no significant obligations remain and collection is probable.\nProduct Revenue - Most of the Company’s revenue contracts are from domestic sales and represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer\norders for the purchase of its products. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on the Company’s selling list price, which is then reduced by estimated\ncosts for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts used to incentivize sales growth and build brand awareness.\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product is transferred to the customer, which is upon shipment to the customer or other\ncustomer-designated delivery point. Taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental agencies are accounted for on a net basis and not included as revenue.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe Company does not accept sales returns from wholesale customers, as the products are pre-approved prior to production and shipment. E-Commerce product returns must be\ncompleted within 45 days of the date of purchase. The Company does not accrue for estimated sales returns as historical sales returns have been minimal. The Company records\ndeferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable. Substantially all the deferred revenue as of June\n30, 2022 was recognized as revenue in the year ended June 30, 2023.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in revenue. Shipping and handling fees associated with freight are generally included in cost of revenue.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may\nnot be recoverable. The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment indicators exist,\nthe Company estimates the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether or not the asset values are\nrecoverable. The Company did not recognize impairment on its long-lived assets during the years ended June 30, 2023, or 2022.\nStock Based Compensation - The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation expense in the\nfinancial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the\naward, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) or immediately if the share-based payments vest immediately.\nInventory - The Company reviews the inventory level of all products and raw materials quarterly. For most products that have been in the market for one year or greater, we\nconsider inventory levels of greater than one year’s sales to be excess or other items that show slower than projected sales. Due to limited market penetration for our products,\nwe have decided to write down 50% of the cost against certain raw materials and finished products. Products that are no longer part of the current product offering are\nconsidered obsolete. The potential for re-sale of slow-moving and obsolete inventories is based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The recorded\ncost of obsolete inventories is then reduced to zero and the slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written off and are recorded as charges to cost of goods sold. All adjustments\nfor obsolete inventory establish a new cost basis for that inventory as we believe such reductions are permanent declines in the market price of our products. Generally, obsolete\ninventory is sold to companies that specialize in the liquidation, while we continue to market slow-moving inventories until they are sold or become obsolete. As obsolete or\nslow-moving inventory is sold or disposed of, we write it off.\nNon-GAAP Measures (unaudited)\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Net Loss)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2023 2022\nNet income (Net loss) GAAP $ (16,930,289) $ (2,100,850)\nIncome tax (3,049,293) (518,398)\nInterest expense, net 4,761,903 202,120\nDepreciation and amortization 5,153,695 1,554,297\nStock compensation 3,664,538 3,331,586\nLoss on the sale of Infusionz and select assets 2,212,542 -\nChange in derivative liability (1,770) 3,293\nLoss (gain) on discontinued operations 2,068,054 (3,823,621)\nGain on SBA PPP loan forgiveness - (300,995)\n(Loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest (559,967) 54,820\nLease impairment, California facility 200,512 -\nGain on sale of asset - (5,500)\nImpairment of Intangible assets 3,746,301 -\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 1,266,226 $ (1,603,248)\n32\nTable of Contents\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company discloses and uses the above-mentioned non-GAAP financial measures internally as a supplement to GAAP financial information to evaluate its operating\nperformance, for financial planning purposes, to establish operational goals, for compensation plans, to measure debt service capability, for capital expenditure planning and to\ndetermine working capital needs and believes that these are useful financial measures also used by investors. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income or\nnet loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for the non-cash stock compensation and stock option expense, acquisition, integration &\nrestructuring expenses, charges and gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and other non-cash items. Non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA are not\nterms defined by GAAP and, as a result, the Company’s measure of non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flow that either\nexcludes or includes amounts that are not normally included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures discussed above, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to net income or net loss as reported for GAAP on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, cash and cash flows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP, and as reflected on the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for or\npresented in lieu of financial measures provided by GAAP and all measures and disclosures of financial information pursuant to GAAP should be read to obtain a\ncomprehensive and thorough understanding of the Company’s financial results.

(“the Company”) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of\noperations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Upexi, Inc. as of June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. We believe that\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ B F Borgers CPA PC\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nLakewood, Colorado\nOctober 2, 2023\nPCAOB ID Number 5041\n35\nTable of Contents\nUPEXI, INC.\nCONSOLDIATED BALANCE SHEETS\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 4,492,291 $ 7,149,806\nAccounts receivable 7,163,564 939,875\nInventory 11,557,128 4,725,685\nDue from Bloomios 845,443 -\nDeferred tax asset, current -

Significant Accounting Policies\nThe significant accounting policies followed are:\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates underlying the Company’s reported financial position and results of operations include the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and\nequipment, impairment of long-lived assets, inventory valuation, fair value of stock-based compensation and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash\nequivalents are maintained at financial institutions and at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these\nbalances.\nAccounts Receivable - The Company regularly reviews accounts receivable for any bad debts based on an analysis of the Company’s collection experience, customer\ncreditworthiness and current economic trends. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on management’s\nreview of accounts receivable, the Company recorded $65,500 and $57,000 as allowance for doubtful accounts at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had no\nbad debt expenses and $131,968 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were direct write-offs against the specific accounts receivable.\nInventory - Inventory consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost is determined by the weighted average moving cost inventory\nmethod. Net realizable value is determined, with appropriate consideration given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, and other factors. On June 30, 2023 the\nCompany had $11,557,128 of finished goods inventory and at June 30, 2022 had $4,725,685 of finished goods inventory with an inventory reserve of $475,000 and $50,000,\nrespectively.\nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets\nranging from 3 to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives of 5 years or the related lease term. Gains and losses upon\ndisposition are reflected in the Statements of Operations in the period of disposition. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. The Company\ndisposed of some equipment during 2023 and 2022 which resulted in gains on the sales as shown in the accompanying Statements of Operations.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the\naggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Company to the seller’s cash consideration and equity instruments issued.\nTransaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net\nassets of the acquiree is recorded as identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\n42\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill - The Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment at least annually and when one or more triggering events\nor circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not\nto exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company performed its annual test as of June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. There was no impairment charge identified in connection with the annual goodwill\nimpairment test at June 30, 2022. It was determined by management that the goodwill related to Interactive Offers was completely impaired at June 30, 2023 based on the sale\nof the business at September 1, 2023. An impairment of goodwill in the amount of $2,889,158 was recorded at June 30, 2023 eliminating all of the goodwill related to\nInteractive Offers.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may\nnot be recoverable. The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment indicators exist,\nthe Company estimates the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether or not the asset values are\nrecoverable.\nThe Company did not recognize impairment on its long-lived assets during the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company did recognize an impairment of $857,143 on the\nassets held for sale, related to the Interactive Offers long-lived assets during the years ended June 30, 2023, leaving $716,944 of intangible assets related to Interactive Offers\nand classified as assets available for sale.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company analyzes its contracts and purchase orders to assess whether revenue is properly recognized. In determining the appropriate amount of\nrevenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, whether for goods and services or licensing, the Company performs the following\nsteps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including\nwhether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance\nobligation. The Company acts as principal in its revenue transactions as the Company is the primary obligor in the transactions. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for\nits products when ownership is transferred to the customer, provided no significant obligations remain and collection is probable.\nProduct Revenue - Most of the Company’s revenue contracts are from domestic sales and represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer\norders for the purchase of its products. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on the Company’s selling list price, which is then reduced by estimated\ncosts for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts used to incentivize sales growth and build brand awareness.\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product is transferred to the customer, which is upon shipment to the customer or other\ncustomer-designated delivery point. Taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental agencies are accounted for on a net basis and not included as revenue.\nThe Company does not accept sales returns from wholesale customers, as the products are pre-approved prior to production and shipment. E-Commerce product returns must be\ncompleted within 45 days of the date of purchase. The Company does not accrue estimated sales returns as historical sales returns have been minimal. The Company records\ndeferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable. Substantially all the deferred revenue as of June\n30, 2022, was recognized as revenue in the year ended June 30, 2023.\n43\nTable of Contents\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in revenue, as this revenue is not directly related to the distribution costs associated with an order. Shipping fees\nassociated with freight are generally included in distribution costs.\nAdvertising - The Company supports its products with advertising to build brand awareness of the Company’s various products in addition to other marketing programs\nexecuted by the Company’s marketing team. The Company believes continual investment in advertising is critical to the development and sale of its branded products.\nAdvertising costs of $7,978,607 and $3,225,256 were expensed as incurred during the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStock Based Compensation - The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation expense in the\nfinancial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the\naward, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) or immediately if the share-based payments vest immediately.\nNon-employee Stock-based Payments - The Company’s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows\nthe provisions of ASC 2018-07, which simplifies the accounting for non-employee share-based payment transactions. The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all\nshare-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor’s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards.\nStock-based payments related to non-employees is accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services, whichever is more\nreadily determinable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance\nby the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor’s performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the\nfair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.\nFair Value Measurements - The Company accounts for financial instruments in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 “Fair value\nMeasurement and Disclosures” (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value\nmeasurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy\nthat distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own\nassumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)\nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n· Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n· Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices\nfor similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted\nprices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by\ncorrelation or other means.\n· Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nThe estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue and\ndebt are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\n44\nTable of Contents\nLeases - The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. GAAP requires that the Company’s leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance\nleases for financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable\nperiod for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and\nfailure to exercise such option will result in an economic penalty. All of the Company’s real estate leases are classified as operating leases.\nMost real estate leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend the lease term for an additional two years. The exercise of lease\nrenewal options is at the Company’s discretion. The Company evaluates renewal options at lease inception and on an ongoing basis and includes renewal options that it is\nreasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities. Lease agreements generally do not require material variable\nlease payments, residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating\nlease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the\nlease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes resulting\nfrom temporary differences. Such temporary differences result from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes. The\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are\nrecovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is\nmore likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company identifies and evaluates uncertain tax positions, if any, and recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions for which there is a less than more-likely-than-not\nprobability of the position being upheld when reviewed by the relevant taxing authority. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability\nis established on the balance sheet. The Company has not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would\nrecognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense\nis recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have\nbeen recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in\nthe years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and\nmeasurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 provides guidance\non de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. There are no material uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2023.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including, but not\nlimited to, reducing the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate and the net operating loss incurred after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely and the two year net\noperating loss carried back was eliminated (prohibited).\n45\nTable of Contents\nEarnings (loss) per Share - Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average common\nshares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares may\nconsist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and upon the conversion of notes. For the year ended, the dilutive common shares are as\nfollows:\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022\nStock options 4,839,278 4,279,888\nWarrants 220,297 106,850\nPreferred stock 277,778 277,778\nConvertible debt 1,157,651 -\nTotal potential dilutive weighted average shares outstanding 6,495,004 4,664,516\nThe dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock\nmethod, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. During the year ended\nJune 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company reported a net loss, so the potential effect is not reflected in the financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue - The Company records deposits as deferred revenue when a customer pays in advance of shipping the product. Once the product is shipped, the deposit is\nrecorded as revenue and the related commissions are paid. All products were shipped related to deposits in deferred revenue, in less than one year.\nConvertible Debt and Securities - The Company follows beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20, which applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt.\nA beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance\nrequires recognition of the conversion option’s in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the\ninstrument. The resulting discount is amortized as interest over the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated\nmaturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the expense must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion\nratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65, “Non-controlling Interests in consolidated Financial\nStatements”. This ASC clarifies that a non-controlling (minority) interest in subsidiaries is an ownership interest in the entity that should be reported as equity in the\nconsolidated financial statements. It also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure on\nthe face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts attributed to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. In accordance with ASC 810-10-45-21, those losses\nattributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries may exceed their interests in the subsidiary’s equity. The excess and any further losses attributable to the\nparent and the non-controlling interest shall be attributed to those interests even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), or other\nstandard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not\nhave a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations upon adoption. The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting\npronouncements, including the new provisions of ASC 326 (“Financial Instruments – Credit Losses”) pertaining to “current expected credit losses,” and does not believe the\nadoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNote 3.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer have conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) (2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of\ncontrols, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation,\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023. The ineffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff:\n(i) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and\n(ii) lack of multiple levels of supervision and review.\nWe are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the current fiscal year, including\nidentifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.\nOur management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing\nbasis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only\nreasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n69\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Remediation Plan\nThe weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature,\nsegregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.\nHowever, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-\nK, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the current\nfiscal year as resources allow:\n(i) Appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such\ninadequacies and to implement additional levels in the review process and the implementation of the new ERP for all subsidiaries; and\n(ii) We will attempt to implement the remediation efforts set out herein by the end of the 2024 fiscal year. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,\nno evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include\nthe realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.\nManagement believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2023, that have materially or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has added significant qualified resources to ensure proper segregation of duties and proper review\nof the financial reporting policies and procedures.\nItem 9B.

In many cases, the Company has adopted specific written policies to implement various provisions of this Code. To the\nextent this Code or those policies require a higher standard than required by commercial practice or applicable laws, we adhere to the higher standard.\nThis Code applies to all of our directors, officers and employees. Except where otherwise noted, all\npersons covered by this Code are referred to as “Company employees” or simply “employees.”\n1.2 RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEHAVIORS\nThe Company is committed to the highest ethical standards in the conduct of its business and therefore the integrity of each employee, officer, and\ndirector is of paramount importance. All employees, officers, and directors are accountable for their actions and must conduct themselves with the\nutmost integrity. As part of conducting business ethically, employees, officers, and directors must conduct business in strict observance of all applicable\nfederal, state, and local laws and regulations as set forth by those bodies that regulate the Company’s business, and those that regulate public companies,\nsuch as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Persons who act unethically or violate this Code and supplementing written policies may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination or removal, and, if applicable, referral to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\nAs a representative of the Company, your responsibility is to act ethically and with the highest level of integrity. Employees who violate the law or this\nCode may expose themselves to substantial civil damages, criminal fines and prison. The Company may also face substantial fines and penalties, and\nmany incur damage to its reputation and standing in the community. If you are unclear about the appropriate response to a particular situation, it is your\nresponsibility to use all the resources available to you to seek guidance. One point should be clear: each employee, officer and director are individually\nresponsible for his or her own actions.\n1.3 SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITY\nIt is incumbent upon supervisors to take every opportunity to model behaviors consistent with our core values and this Code. If you are a supervisor, you\nare expected to demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct by encouraging open and honest discussions of the ethical, legal, and regulatory\nimplications of business decisions, and by creating an open and supportive environment where your employees are comfortable asking questions, raising\nconcerns and reporting misconduct. You should also ensure that everyone under your supervision clearly understands the legal and ethical expectations\nof the Company, including all aspects of the Code, policies and applicable laws. You must also work with the Human Resources department when you\nbecome aware of any suspected violations of this Code.\n3\n1.4 SEEKING HELP AND INFORMATION\nThis Code is not intended to be a comprehensive rulebook and cannot address every situation that you may face. If you feel uncomfortable about a\nsituation or have any doubts about whether it is consistent with the Company’s ethical standards, seek help. We encourage you to contact your\nsupervisor for help first. If your supervisor cannot answer your question or if you do not feel comfortable contacting your supervisor, contact the Chief\nFinancial Officer or send an inquiry through the Company website.\n1.5 REPORTING VIOLATIONS OR SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS\nThe Company is committed to establishing and maintaining an effective process for employees, officers, and directors to report, and for the Company to\nrespond to and correct, any type of misconduct. All employees, officers, and directors have a continuing responsibility and duty to report any known or\nsuspected violation of this Code, including any violation of the laws, rules, regulations or policies that apply to the Company. If you know of or suspect\na violation of this Code, immediately report the conduct to your supervisor, or the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Your supervisor or the Chief\nFinancial Officer will contact the proper legal counsel, who will work with you and your supervisor to investigate your concern. If you do not feel\ncomfortable reporting the conduct to your supervisor or you do not get a satisfactory response, you may contact the proper legal counsel directly.\nWhile providing your identity may assist the Company in addressing your questions or concerns, please note that if you choose,y ou may remain\nanonymous and will not be required to reveal your identity.\n1.6 INVESTIGATING REPORTS\nAll reports of known or suspected violations will be handled sensitively and with discretion. Your supervisor, the Chief Financial Officer and the\nCompany will protect your confidentiality to the extent possible, consistent with law and the Company’s need to investigate your concern. During an\ninvestigation of suspected violations, you are required to cooperate fully in the investigation, and must take certain steps to do so. You must be honest\nand forthcoming at all times during an investigation, must provide investigators with full, accurate, timely, and truthful information, and must not\ninterfere or obstruct the investigation. You may not discuss an investigation with others unless authorized to do so. Failure to take any of these steps\nduring an investigation is a violation of this Code.\n4\nAny person accused of violating this Code will be given an opportunity to present his or her version of the events prior to any determination that a\nviolation has occurred, or any Company decision regarding the appropriate discipline.\n1.7 POLICY AGAINST RETALIATION\nThe Company prohibits retaliation against an employee who, in good faith, seeks help or reports known or suspected violations.

A conflict of interest can occur when an employee’s private\ninterest interferes, or reasonably appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company. You must conduct your outside associations and personal\nbusiness, financial, and other relationships in a manner that avoids any conflict of interest, or appearance of a conflict of interest, between yourself and\nthe Company. You must avoid any private interest that influences your ability to act in the interests of the Company or that makes it difficult to perform\nyour work objectively and effectively. The term “outside association” includes any affiliation, association, interest, relationship, or employment that you\nhave with anyone other than the Company. Further, you must not give the appearance of Company representation in any of your personal affairs.\nIt is impractical to conceive and set forth rules that cover every situation in which a conflict of interest may arise. The following is not an exhaustive list\nof problem areas, but rather a guide in applying the Company’s basic conflict of interest policy to any situation.\nEmployment Relationships. A conflict of interest may arise when you or a member of your immediate family holds a position as an\nemployee, officer or director of an entity with which the Company has or is likely to have a business relationship, or with which the\nCompany competes or is likely to compete. No employee or officer should accept employment with any entity that is a customer, supplier\nor competitor of the Company. You must also report when a family member has a relationship with an entity with which the Company has\nor is likely to have a business relationship or with which the Company competes or is likely to compete.\nImproper Personal Benefits. You may not obtain any improper personal benefits or favors because of your position with the Company.\nFinancial Interests. You should not have a financial interest (ownership or otherwise) in any company that is a customer, supplier or\ncompetitor of the Company, unless pre-approved by the proper legal counsel. Generally, a significant financial interest will not be\npermitted except in exceptional circumstances. Significant financial interest means (i) ownership of greater than 1% of the equity of a\ncustomer, supplier or competitor or (ii) an investment in a customer, supplier or competitor that represents more than 5% of the total assets\nof the employee making the investment.\nCorporate Opportunities. You are prohibited from taking advantage of an opportunity to engage in a business activity in which the\nCompany has an actual interest or a reasonable expectation of an interest.\nUse of Company Assets. You are prohibited from using Company assets to pursue personal interests.\nLoans or Other Financial Transactions. You should not obtain loans or guarantees of personal obligations from, or enter into any other\npersonal financial transaction with, the Company or any company that is a customer, supplier or competitor of the Company. This\nguideline does not prohibit arms-length transactions with banks, brokerage firms or other financial institutions.\n6\nService on Boards and Committees. You should not serve on a board of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity (whether\nprofit or not-for-profit) whose interests reasonably would be expected to conflict with those of the Company.\nActions of Family Members. The actions of family members outside the workplace may also give rise to the conflicts of interest described\nabove because they may influence an employee’s objectivity in making decisions on behalf of the Company. For purposes of this Code,\n“family members” include your spouse or life-partner, parents, children and siblings, whether by blood, marriage or adoption, and anyone\nresiding in your home.\n2.2 DISCLOSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nWhile it is incumbent on each employee to act in a manner at all times that is in the best interests of the Company, and avoid conflicts of interest, the\nCompany recognizes that from time to time, situations may occur in which a conflict or appearance of a conflict of interest is unavoidable. The\nCompany requires that employees disclose any situations that reasonably would be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. If you suspect that you\nhave a conflict of interest, or something that others could reasonably perceive as a conflict of interest, you must report it to the Company. If you are an\nemployee, you must report it to the Vice President of your department, the Chief Financial Officer, or the proper legal counsel. If you are an officer, you\nmust report the matter to the proper legal counsel, and if you are a director, to the Audit Committee. If you are an employee, your Vice President or the\nChief Financial Officer will coordinate with the proper legal counsel to review the matter and resolve it as necessary.\n2.3 RESOLVING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nWhen a conflict or appearance of a conflict of interest occurs, or is reasonably likely to occur, the Company is committed to resolving the situation in a\nway that protects the best interests of the Company. Such resolution can take many forms, such as requiring the employee to recuse himself or herself\nfrom participating in a particular matter, reassigning duties, or additional measures designed to ensure that the best interests of the Company are not\ncompromised by the conflict of interest. In all cases, conflicts of interest must be handled in an ethical manner; meaning they must be fully disclosed\nand considered prior to being resolved. The Chief Financial Officer or the proper legal counsel, as applicable, will handle all questions of conflicts of\ninterest, including coordinating with the Audit Committee as necessary. Conflicts may be permitted only after full disclosure has been made, the\nCompany (or the Audit Committee, as appropriate) has given prior written approval, and the employee has agreed to adhere to any safeguards put into\nplace to ensure that the best interests of the Company are fully protected in the situation in question. Conflicts of interest resulting from a violation of\nthis Code may also be subject to discipline.\n7\n3 BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT, MEALS, AND GIFTS\nThe Company recognizes that occasional exchanges of business courtesies between vendors, suppliers, and our employees, such as entertainment,\nmeals, or gifts, can be helpful in building and maintaining business relationships. However, you should exercise extreme caution when accepting offers\nof entertainment, meals or gifts, as regular or excessive entertainment, meals or gifts can easily create a conflict or appearance of a conflict of interest,\nand irreparably damage your reputation and the reputation of the Company. Generally, entertainment and gifts must have a clear business purpose and\nshould benefit the Company by building trust and goodwill in the business relationship. Participating in entertainment such as meals, sports events, golf\noutings, and celebration functions, etc. with our business partners is acceptable provided the entertainment with the same partner is infrequent, in good\ntaste, in moderation, and not extravagant. Similarly, gifts should be of only nominal value (generally less than $100), infrequent, in good taste, in\nmoderation, and not extravagant. Efforts should also be made so that even when a clear business purpose has been established, the costs for the\nentertainment or meals are shared, or reciprocated when appropriate and possible. In no event should you ever solicit offers of entertainment, meals or\ngifts, and similarly, you must never accept entertainment, meals or gifts if there is no clear business purpose, or if such acceptance would create or\nappear to create a conflict of interest.\nAttending supplier sponsored conferences, seminars, and entertainment events where air travel, hotel, or other accommodations are provided, creates\nmore serious concerns. Your participation in events where the sponsor provides both business and entertainment activities are acceptable when your\nparticipation is important to the business of the Company. You should not attend these events if it does not serve a significant business purpose for the\nCompany or could cause, or appear to cause, you to favor that supplier over others. If you are invited by suppliers to attend conferences, seminars, or\nentertainment events where the supplier pays for air travel or other accommodations, you must obtain prior approval from an appropriate senior\nexecutive.\nLikewise, when interacting with customers and vendors, you are expected to adhere to the policies and procedures established by those entities\nconcerning meals, entertainment and gifts.\nIf you receive an offer for entertainment or meals that do not accord with these standards, you should politely decline. Similarly, gifts that do not accord\nwith these standards should be returned, with an explanation that the Company’s standards do not permit the employee to retain the gift. The Company,\nas well as the employee’s supervisor, may also put additional limits and policies in place with respect to entertainment, meals and gifts, including\nappropriate documentation and notice and approval requirements.\n8\n4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nEmployees have access to a variety of confidential information as a result of their relationship with the Company. Confidential information includes but\nis not limited to all non-public information of the Company, or its customers or suppliers, and personally identifiable information of employees, or\npersons associated with the Company’s business partners. You must safeguard all confidential information of the Company or third parties with which\nthe Company conducts business, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Your obligation to protect confidential information continues\nafter you leave the Company. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could cause competitive harm to the Company or its business partners\nand could result in legal liability to you and the Company.\nAny questions or concerns regarding whether disclosure of Company information is legally mandated should be promptly referred to the Chief\nExecutive Office of Chief Financial Officer.\n5 COMPETITION AND FAIR DEALING\nAll employees should endeavor to deal fairly with fellow employees and with the Company’s customers, suppliers and competitors. Employees should\nnot take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any\nother unfair-dealing practice.\n5.1 RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS\nOur business success depends upon our ability to foster lasting customer relationships. The Company is committed to dealing with customers fairly,\nhonestly, and with integrity. Specifically, you should keep the following guidelines in mind when dealing with customers:\n· Information we supply to customers should be accurate and complete to the best of our knowledge. Employees should not deliberately\nmisrepresent information to customers.\n· Employees should not refuse to sell the Company’s products or services simply because a customer is buying products or services from\nanother supplier.\n· Customer entertainment should not exceed reasonable and customary business practice. Employees should not provide entertainment or\nother benefits that could be viewed as an inducement to, or a reward for, customer purchase decisions.\n5.2 RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS\nThe Company deals fairly and honestly with its suppliers. This means that our relationships with suppliers are based on price, quality, service and\nreputation, among other factors. Employees dealing with suppliers should carefully guard their objectivity. Specifically, you should not accept or solicit\nany personal benefit from a supplier or potential supplier that might compromise, or appear to compromise, your objective assessment of the supplier’s\nproducts and prices.\n9\n5.3 RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPETITORS\nThe Company is committed to free and open competition in the marketplace. You should avoid actions that would be contrary to laws governing\ncompetitive practices in the marketplace, including federal and state antitrust laws. Such actions include misappropriation and/or misuse of a\ncompetitor’s confidential information or making false statements about the competitor’s business and business practices. For a further discussion of\nappropriate and inappropriate business conduct with competitors, see “Compliance with Laws: Antitrust” below.\n6 PROTECTION AND USE OF COMPANY ASSETS\nEmployees should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use for legitimate business purposes only. Theft, carelessness and waste have\na direct impact on the Company’s profitability. The use of Company funds or assets for any unlawful or improper purpose is prohibited.\nTo ensure the protection and proper use of the Company’s assets, you should:\n· Exercise reasonable care to prevent theft, damage or misuse of Company property.\n· Report the actual or suspected theft, damage or misuse of Company property to a supervisor.\n· Use the Company’s telephone system, other electronic communication services, written materials and other property for business-related\npurposes.\n· Safeguard all electronic programs, data, communications and written materials from inadvertent access by others.\n· Use Company property only for legitimate business purposes, as authorized in connection with your job responsibilities.\nYou should also be aware that Company property includes all data and communications transmitted or received to or by, or contained in, the Company’s\nelectronic or telephonic systems. Company property also includes all written communications. Employees and other users of this property should have\nno expectation of privacy with respect to these communications and data. To the extent permitted by law, the Company has the ability, and reserves the\nright, to monitor all electronic and telephonic communication. These communications may also be subject to disclosure to law enforcement or\ngovernment officials.\n10\n7 COMPANY RECORDS\nAccurate and reliable records are crucial to our business. Our records are the basis of our earnings statements, financial reports and other disclosures to\nthe public and guide our business decision-making and strategic planning. Company records include booking information, payroll, timecards, travel and\nexpense reports, e-mails, accounting and financial data, measurement and performance records, electronic data files and all other records maintained in\nthe ordinary course of our business.\nAll Company records must be complete, accurate and reliable in all material respects. Undisclosed or unrecorded funds, payments or receipts are\ninconsistent with our business practices and are prohibited. You are also responsible for understanding and complying with record keeping policies as\nestablished by the Company from time to time. Ask your supervisor if you have any questions.\n8 POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACTIVITIES\nThe Company encourages its employees to participate in the political process as individuals and on their own time. However, federal and state\ncontribution and lobbying laws severely limit the contributions the Company can make to political parties or candidates. It is Company policy that\nCompany funds or assets are not be used to make a political contribution to any political party or candidate, unless prior approval has been given by the\nproper legal counsel.\nThe following guidelines are intended to ensure that any political activity you pursue complies with this policy:\nContribution of Funds. You may contribute your personal funds to political parties or candidates. The Company will not reimburse you\nfor personal political contributions.\nVolunteer Activities. You may participate in volunteer political activities during non-work time. You may not participate in political\nactivities during work time.\nUse of Company Facilities. The Company’s facilities should not be used for political activities (including fundraisers or other activities\nrelated to running for office). The Company may make its facilities available for limited political functions, including speeches by\ngovernment officials and political candidates, with the approval of the proper legal counsel.\nUse of Company Name. When you participate in political affairs, you should be careful to make it clear that your views and actions are\nyour own, and not made on behalf of the Company. For instance, Company letterhead should not be used to send out personal letters in\nconnection with political activities.\n11\nThese guidelines are intended to ensure that any political activity you pursue is done voluntarily and on your own resources and time. Please contact the\nChief Financial Officer if you have any questions about this policy.\n9 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS\nEach employee has an obligation to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company. These include, without limitation, laws\ncovering bribery and kickbacks, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, information privacy, insider trading, illegal political contributions, antitrust\nprohibitions, foreign corrupt practices, offering or receiving gratuities, environmental hazards, employment discrimination or harassment, occupational\nhealth and safety, false or misleading financial information or misuse of corporate assets. You are expected to understand and comply with all laws,\nrules and regulations that apply to your job position. If any doubt exists about whether a course of action is lawful, you should seek advice from your\nsupervisor or the Chief Financial Officer, which will contact the proper legal counsel, if necessary.\n9. 1 ANTI-BRIBERY\nThe Company’s anti-bribery prohibition is simple: No employee, officer or director may offer a bribe nor receive a bribe, under any circumstances. The\nCompany maintains an Anti-Bribery Policy, which contains other prohibitions and requirements, for example: reporting of red flag events, restricting\nhiring of foreign agents and reporting of any violations of the Company’s Anti-Bribery Policy.\nIf there are any questions regarding the Company’s Anti-Bribery Policy, you should contact the Chief Financial Officer.\n9.2 EXPORT CONTROL\nVarious U.S. Government agencies maintain lists that identify individuals or entities barred or restricted from entering into certain types of transactions\nwith U.S. persons. to the Company must ensure that the Company does not engage in a transaction with a barred entity or person. All employees have an\nobligation to notify the Company’s Chief Financial Officer if any person with whom they are engaging on behalf of the Company are identified on any\nof these lists. If in doubt, contact the Legal department or Chief Financial Officer for more information on screening to ensure compliance.\nSimilarly, various countries are subject to comprehensive United States economic sanctions and trade embargoes, and the Company is prohibited from\nengaging in transactions that result in any goods, technology or monies being diverted to any customer or end user in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Sudan.\nFrom time to time the United States also has limited sanctions pertaining to other countries (e.g. Russia, Syria and Libya), so it is important to check if\nany party to a proposed Company transaction is from a country for which the United States has imposed complete embargoes or partial sanctions. When\nin doubt, discuss any potential transaction with the Legal department.\n12\n9.3 ANTITRUST\nAntitrust laws of the U.S. and other countries are designed to protect consumers and competitors against unfair business practices and to promote and\npreserve competition. Our policy is to compete vigorously and ethically while complying with all antitrust, monopoly, competition or cartel laws in all\ncountries, states or localities in which the Company conducts business.\nIn general, U.S. antitrust laws forbid agreements or actions “in restraint of trade.” All employees should be familiar with the general principles of the\nU.S. antitrust laws. The following is a summary of actions that are violations of U.S. antitrust laws:\n· Price Fixing. The Company may not agree with its competitors to raise, lower or stabilize prices or any element of price, including discounts\nand credit terms.\n· Limitation of Supply. The Company may not agree with its competitors to limit its production or restrict the supply of its services.\n· Allocation of Business. The Company may not agree with its competitors to divide or allocate markets, territories or customers.\n· Boycott. The Company may not agree with its competitors to refuse to sell or purchase products from third parties. In addition, the\nCompany may not prevent a customer from purchasing or using non-Company products or services.\n· Tying. The Company may not require a customer to purchase a product that it does not want as a condition to the sale of a different product\nthat the customer does wish to purchase.\nEmployees should exercise caution in meetings with competitors. Any meeting with a competitor may give rise to the appearance of impropriety. As a\nresult, if you are required to meet with a competitor for any reason, you should obtain the prior approval of the CEO, who will contact the proper legal\ncounsel, if necessary. You should try to meet with competitors in a closely monitored and controlled environment for a limited period of time. The\ncontents of your meeting should be fully documented. Specifically, you should avoid any communications with a competitor regarding:\n13\n· Prices;\n· Costs;\n· Market share;\n· Allocation of sales territories;\n· Profits and profit margins;\n· Supplier’s terms and conditions;\n· Product or service offerings;\n· Terms and conditions of sale;\n· Facilities or capabilities;\n· Bids for a particular contract or program;\n· Selection, retention or quality of customers; or\n· Distribution methods or channels.\nEmployees should also be cautious when attending meetings of professional organizations and trade associations at which competitors are present.\nAttending meetings of professional organizations and trade associations is both legal and proper, if such meetings have a legitimate business purpose. At\nsuch meetings, you should not discuss pricing policy or other competitive terms, plans for new or expanded facilities or any other proprietary or\ncompetitively sensitive information.\nViolations of antitrust laws carry severe consequences and may expose the Company and employees to substantial civil damages, criminal fines and, in\nthe case of individuals, prison terms. Whenever any doubt exists as to the legality of a particular action or arrangement, it is your responsibility to\ncontact the CEO or CFO, who will contact the proper legal counsel promptly for assistance, approval and review.\n9.4 INSIDER TRADING\nThe laws against insider trading are specific and complex. The Company also maintains extensive policies concerning insider trading designed to help\nthe Company and an employee comply with the laws on insider trading. Employees are responsible for reading and complying with these policies. As a\nguideline, employees are prohibited from trading in the stock or other securities of the Company while in possession of material, nonpublic information\nabout the Company. In addition, Company employees are prohibited from recommending, “tipping” or suggesting that anyone else buy or sell stock or\nother securities of the Company on the basis of material, nonpublic information. Company employees who obtain material nonpublic information about\nanother company in the course of their employment are prohibited from trading in the stock or securities of the other company while in possession of\nsuch information or “tipping” others to trade on the basis of such information. Violation of insider trading laws can result in severe fines and criminal\npenalties, as well as disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including termination of employment.\nInformation is “non-public” if it has not been made generally available to the public by means of a press release or other means of widespread\ndistribution. Information is “material” if a reasonable investor would consider it important in a decision to buy, hold or sell stock or other securities. As a\nrule of thumb, any information that would affect the value of stock or other securities should be considered material. Examples of information that is\ngenerally considered “material” include:\n14\n· Financial results or forecasts, or any information that indicates a company’s financial results may exceed or fall short of forecasts or\nexpectations;\n· Important new products or services;\n· Pending or contemplated acquisitions or dispositions, including mergers, tender offers or joint venture proposals;\n· Possible management changes or changes of control;\n· Pending or contemplated public or private sales of debt or equity securities;\n· Acquisition or loss of a significant customer or contract;\n· Significant write-offs;\n· Initiation or settlement of significant litigation; and\n· Changes in the Company’s auditors or a notification from its auditors that the Company may no longer rely on the auditor’s report.\nAny questions about information you may possess or about any dealings you have had in the Company’s securities should be promptly brought to the\nattention of the CFO.\n10 ACCURACY OF FINANCIAL REPORTS\nAs a public company we are subject to various securities laws, regulations and reporting obligations. Both federal law and our policies require the\ndisclosure of accurate and complete information regarding the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Inaccurate, incomplete\nor untimely reporting will not be tolerated and can severely damage the Company and result in legal liability.\nEmployees working in financial, public relations and legal roles have a special responsibility to ensure that all of our financial disclosures are full, fair,\naccurate, timely and understandable. If you work in such a capacity, you are expected to understand and strictly comply with generally accepted\naccounting principles and all standards, laws and regulations for accounting and financial reporting of transactions, estimates and forecasts.\n15\n11 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS\nThe Company places a high value on its credibility and reputation in the community. What is written or said about the Company in the news media and\ninvestment community directly impacts our reputation, positively or negatively. Our policy is to provide timely, accurate and complete information in\nresponse to public requests (media, analysts, etc.), consistent with our obligations to maintain the confidentiality of competitive and proprietary\ninformation and to prevent selective disclosure of market-sensitive financial data. In addition, the Company is required to periodically make public\ncertain information about itself, and file regular reports concerning its financial and operational performance. The Company also from time to time may\nchoose to issue information of interest to its shareholders or the general public. The Company is committed to ensuring that its communications are\ntruthful, meaningful, consistent, and in compliance with all laws.\nTo ensure compliance with its standards and its legal obligations, the Company limits the persons who may speak on behalf of the Company and has\nextensive procedures in place to review and approve all public communications. You should direct all news media or other public requests for\ninformation regarding the Company to the Company’s media relations personnel. The media relations personnel will work with you and the appropriate\nCompany departments to evaluate and coordinate a response to the request. Only persons designated by the Company to speak on its behalf are\nauthorized to disclose information about the Company. Similarly, even when designated as authorized to speak for the Company, an employee should\nnever disseminate any information that has not been pre-approved for release.\nCompany employees who regularly interact with the media, the securities market, investors or the general public also have a special responsibility to\nunderstand and comply with specific laws regarding disclosure, including but not limited to Regulation Fair Disclosure. Contact the Chief Financial\nOfficer if you have any questions about the scope or application of the laws applicable to your job responsibilities, including Regulation FD.\n13 CONCLUSION\nThis Code of Business Conduct and Ethics contains general guidelines for conducting the business of the Company consistent with the highest standards\nof business ethics. If you are faced with making a challenging decision regarding a particular situation, you are not alone. There are many resources\navailable to help resolve ethical questions or concerns. If you have any questions, you may contact:\n· Your immediate supervisor;\n· Other supervisors or management personnel;\n· The Human Resources department;\n· Chief Financial Officer\nWe expect all Company employees to adhere to these standards.\n16\nCERTIFICATION\nThe undersigned hereby acknowledges receipt of UPEXI, Inc.’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”), and certifies that the\nundersigned has read, understands and will comply with the Code.\nDate:\nSignature\nPrint Name\nTitle\nOne signed copy of this certificate should be sent to:\nUPEXI, Inc.\n3030 N.
