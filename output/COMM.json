(NASDAQ: COMM), a global leader in network connectivity solutions, today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Summary of Consolidated Results**  \n---  \n**Q3** |  **Q3** |  **% Change**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **YOY**  \n**(in millions, except per share amounts)**  \nNet sales  |  $  |  1,082.2  |  $  |  1,053.4  |  2.7  |  %   \nGAAP loss from continuing operations  |  (96.7  |  )  |  (533.8  |  )  |  (81.9  |  )   \nGAAP loss from continuing operations per share  |  (0.52  |  )  |  (2.59  |  )  |  NM   \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) |  204.2  |  156.8  |  30.2   \nCore non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) (2) |  220.4  |  176.3  |  25.0   \nNon-GAAP adjusted net loss per diluted share (1) |  (0.05  |  )  |  (0.12  |  )  |  NM   \nNM – Not meaningful   \n(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.   \n(2) Core financial measures reflect the results of the CCS, NICS (excluding DAS) and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment, since these costs were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, these costs related to the Home segment have been reallocated to the remaining segments. These costs related to the OWN segment and DAS business unit will be reallocated to the remaining segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025.   \n  \n“In the third quarter, CommScope delivered net sales of $1.082 billion, up 3% from the prior year, and Core adjusted EBITDA of $220 million, up 25% from the prior year. These results were primarily driven by strength in our CCS segment which delivered $174 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 115% from the prior year. In addition to the CCS segment, we saw a sequential recovery in our Core NICS segment (excluding DAS). I’m pleased with our third quarter performance as we sequentially improved both revenue and adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter and saw a year-over-year improvement. Visibility continues to remain limited as upgrade timing and magnitude of network upgrades remain uncertain. We would expect to see continued momentum in all of our businesses over the next several quarters as we have made the investments in our products to help our customers deliver their next generations networks. We continue to control what we can, which was demonstrated by our third quarter 2024 Core adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 20.4%, a significant improvement compared to 16.7% in the same prior year period,” said Chuck Treadway, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n“For the third quarter, CommScope (including OWN and DAS) reported net sales of $1.414 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $308 million increased by 27%. We have narrowed our full year Core adjusted EBITDA guideposts to $700 to $750 million. We finished the third quarter with strong total liquidity of more than $1.02 billion including cash at quarter end of $456 million. In the third quarter, we engaged with our current creditors to address our debt maturities, and those conversations continue to be constructive,” added Kyle Lorentzen, Chief Financial Officer. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, CommScope entered into an agreement with Amphenol Corporation to divest of its OWN segment and DAS business unit. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the pending transaction, unless otherwise noted, these financial results relate to CommScope’s continuing operations based on the following remaining three operating segments: CCS, NICS (excluding DAS) and ANS. For all periods presented, amounts have been recast to reflect these changes. \n\n**Third Quarter Results and Comparisons**\n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 2.7% year-over-year to $1.082 billion due to stronger net sales in the CCS segment, partially offset by lower net sales in the NICS and ANS segments. Net sales increased across all regions, except the Caribbean and Latin America region, in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nLoss from continuing operations of $96.7 million, or $(0.52) per share, in the third quarter of 2024, improved compared to the prior year period's loss from continuing operations of $533.8 million, or $(2.59) per share. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.2 million, or $(0.05) per share, versus $30.3 million, or $(0.12) per share, in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 30.2% to $204.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14.9% in the same prior year period. Core non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 25.0% to $220.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same prior year period. Core non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.4% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 16.7% in the same prior year period. \n\nReconciliations of the reported GAAP results to non-GAAP adjusted results are included below. \n\n**Third Quarter Comparisons**\n\n**Sales by Region**\n\n**% Change**  \n---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **YOY**  \nUnited States |  $  |  714.6  |  $  |  693.2  |  3.1  |  %   \nEurope, Middle East and Africa |  159.3  |  153.1  |  4.0   \nAsia Pacific |  126.6  |  126.1  |  0.4   \nCaribbean and Latin America |  47.5  |  50.0  |  (5.0  |  )   \nCanada |  34.2  |  31.0  |  10.3   \n**Total net sales** |  $  |  1,082.2  |  $  |  1,053.4  |  2.7  |  %   \n  \n**Segment Net Sales**\n\n**% Change**  \n---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **YOY**  \nCCS  |  $  |  736.7  |  $  |  630.5  |  16.8  |  %   \nNICS  |  157.5  |  202.6  |  (22.3  |  )   \nANS  |  188.0  |  220.3  |  (14.7  |  )   \n**Total net sales** |  $  |  1,082.2  |  $  |  1,053.4  |  2.7  |  %   \n  \n**Segment Operating Income (Loss)**\n\n**% Change**  \n---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **YOY**  \nCCS  |  $  |  136.5  |  $  |  26.3  |  419.0  |  %   \nNICS  |  9.1  |  21.3  |  (57.3  |  )   \nANS  |  (18.0  |  )  |  (429.8  |  )  |  (95.8  |  )   \nCore operating income (1) |  127.6  |  (382.2  |  )  |  NM   \nCorporate and other (2) |  (25.4  |  )  |  (26.2  |  )  |  (3.1  |  )   \n**Total operating income (loss)** |  $  |  102.2  |  $  |  (408.4  |  )  |  NM   \n  \n**Segment Adjusted EBITDA (See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below)**\n\n**% Change**  \n---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **YOY**  \nCCS  |  $  |  173.9  |  $  |  80.9  |  115.0  |  %   \nNICS  |  27.8  |  39.2  |  (29.1  |  )   \nANS  |  18.7  |  56.2  |  (66.7  |  )   \nCore adjusted EBITDA (1) |  220.4  |  176.3  |  25.0   \nCorporate and other (2) |  (16.2  |  )  |  (19.5  |  )  |  (16.9  |  )   \n**Total segment adjusted EBITDA** |  $  |  204.2  |  $  |  156.8  |  30.2  |  %   \nNM – Not meaningful   \n(1) Core financial measures reflect the results of the CCS, NICS (excluding DAS) and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment, since these costs were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations.   \n(2) The corporate and other line item above reflects general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment.

CommScope management further believes that these financial measures are useful in assessing CommScope’s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. CommScope management also uses certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring CommScope’s performance relative to that of its competitors. CommScope management believes these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate CommScope’s performance and that of its competitors. However, CommScope’s use of certain non-GAAP terms may vary from that of others in its industry. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flow from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity. A reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP measures discussed herein to their most comparable GAAP measures is below. \n\n**Core Measures**\n\nCommScope believes that presenting Core financial measures enhances the investor’s understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core businesses. Core financial measures are the aggregate of the CCS, NICS (excluding DAS), and ANS segments, and exclude general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment, since these costs were not directly attributable to the discontinued operations. The Core results represent the business results as currently managed and reported by CommScope. Future results and the composition of any business divested in the future may vary and differ materially from the presentation of the Core financial measures. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes certain statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

our stock price volatility; income tax rate variability and ability to recover amounts recorded as deferred tax assets; and other factors beyond our control. These and other factors are discussed in greater detail in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and may be updated from time to time in our annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
