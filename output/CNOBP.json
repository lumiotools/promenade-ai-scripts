Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results; Declares Common and Preferred Dividends\n\nCompany Release - 10/24/2024 7:00 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNOB) (the “Company” or “ConnectOne”), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income available to common stockholders of $15.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $17.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $19.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Included in net income available to common stockholders’ was merger and restructuring pre-tax expenses of $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, while there were no such charges during the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $0.46 for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.51 for the third quarter of 2023. Return on average assets was 0.70%, 0.79% and 0.88% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Return on average tangible common equity was 6.93%, 7.98% and 9.11% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nOperating net income available to common stockholders, which excludes non-operating items, was $16.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, $17.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $20.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating diluted earnings per share were $0.42 for the third quarter of 2024, $0.47 for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.52 for the third quarter of 2023. Operating return on average assets was 0.72%, 0.80% and 0.90% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Operating return on average tangible common equity was 7.03%, 8.05% and 9.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. See supplemental tables for a complete reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings, and other non-GAAP measures.\n\nThe decrease in net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share from the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in the provision for credit losses, a $1.0 million increase in noninterest expenses, and a $0.6 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in income tax expenses and a $0.3 million increase in noninterest income. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in noninterest expenses, a $2.3 million increase in the provision for credit losses, and a $1.5 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in noninterest income and a $1.2 million decrease in income tax expense. The increases in noninterest expenses when compared to the prior sequential quarter and the prior year quarter included the impact of the aforementioned $0.7 million of merger and restructuring expense that occurred during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“In September, we announced a planned merger with The First of Long Island Corporation, a transaction that we believe will create a truly premier New York-metro community bank,” commented Frank Sorrentino, ConnectOne’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our integration planning is off to a good start, the initial regulatory process is underway, and we’re excited about creating a significantly enhanced platform for continued growth across all markets and communities we serve. Further, the economic environment and interest rate outlook confirms our belief that this combination will deliver meaningful benefits to our communities, clients and shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the months and quarters ahead.”\n\nMr. Sorrentino added, “Meanwhile, we remain focused and committed to our client-first culture and relationship banking model. During the first nine months of the year, we have actively reduced non-relationship loans from our balance sheet in an effort to improve our loan-to-deposit ratio, diversify our loan mix, and capitalize on the improving interest rate environment.”\n\n“The net interest margin, for the third quarter, on a core basis was flat; however, as a result of the Fed’s 50 basis-point cut in late September, we ended the quarter with a so-called spot margin upwards of 10 basis points wider. And with our liability-sensitive balance sheet, we are positioned to drive increased profitability through the fourth quarter, into 2025 and post-merger completion.”\n\n**Dividend Declarations**\n\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on both its common stock and its outstanding preferred stock. A cash dividend on common stock of $0.18 per share will be paid on December 2, 2024, to common stockholders of record on November 15, 2024. A dividend of $0.328125 per depositary share, representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Company’s 5.25% Fixed Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, will also be paid on December 2, 2024 to holders of record on November 15, 2024.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $61.7 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 0.9%, from the second quarter of 2024, due to a five basis-point contraction of the net interest margin to 2.67% from 2.72%. During the third quarter of 2024, average loans decreased $89.4 million, or 1.1% when compared to the second quarter of 2024. The contraction of the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in average cash balances during the third quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in loan prepayment fees and nonaccrual loan interest recapture. The net interest margin is expected to increase by 10 basis points or more in the fourth quarter of 2024 reflecting the Fed’s actual and expected rate cuts along with deployment of excess cash-on-hand.\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by $1.5 million, or 2.4%, from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from a nine basis-point contraction in the net interest margin to 2.67% from 2.76%. During the third quarter of 2024, average loans decreased by $45.9 million, or 0.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The contraction of the net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to a 40 basis-point increase in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 24 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.\n\nNoninterest income was $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $0.3 million increase in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2024 was due to a $0.6 million increase in net gains on equity securities, a $0.4 million increase in BOLI death benefits and a $0.2 million increase in other deposit, loan and other income, partially offset a $0.9 million decrease in net gains on sale of loans held-for-sale. The $1.2 million increase in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due to a $0.7 million increase in net gains on equity securities, a $0.4 million increase in BOLI death benefits received, a $0.2 million increase in BOLI income, a $0.1 million increase in BoeFly income, and a $0.1 million increase in other deposit, loan and other income, partially offset by a decrease in net gains on sale of loans held-for-sale of $0.3 million.\n\nNoninterest expenses were $38.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, $37.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $1.0 million increase in noninterest expenses for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in merger and restructuring expenses, a $0.3 million increase in information and technology communications, a $0.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $0.2 million increase in professional and consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in other expenses of $0.4 million. The $2.9 million increase in noninterest expenses for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in information technology and communications, a $0.7 million increase in merger and restructuring expenses, a $0.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $0.3 million increase in professional and consulting, a $0.2 million increase in occupancy and equipment and a $0.1 million increase in marketing and advertising, partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of $0.1 million. The increases in information technology and communications when compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 are attributable to additional investments in technology, equipment, and software. The increase in salaries and employee benefits when compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in incentive-based compensation accruals, partially offset by decreases in payroll tax expenses and other employee benefit expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to increases in incentive-based compensation accruals, and an increase in other employee benefit expenses, partially offset by decreases in stock-compensation expenses.\n\nIncome tax expense was $6.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, $6.7 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates for the second quarter of 2024, first quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2023 were 26.0%, 26.0% and 25.2%, respectively.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the current quarter’s provision for credit losses from both the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to increases in specific reserves, partially offset by decreases in general reserves.\n\nNonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (the Bank had no other real estate owned during the periods reported), was $51.3 million as of September 30, 2024, $52.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and $56.1 million as of September 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.53% as of September 30, 2024, 0.53% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.58% as of September 30, 2023. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to loans receivable was 0.63%, 0.63% and 0.69%, as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The annualized net loan charge-offs ratio was 0.17% for the third quarter of 2024, 0.43% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 0.12% for the third quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.02%, 0.98%, and 1.08% of loans receivable as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 160.8% as of September 30, 2024, 156.1% as of December 31, 2023 and 157.4% as of September 30, 2023. Criticized and classified loans as a percentage of total loans was 2.23% as of September 30, 2024, up from 1.35% as of December 31, 2023 and up from 1.44% as of September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a loan modification of one CRE relationship that was moved to special mention. Loans delinquent 30 to 89 days was 0.16% of loans as of September 30, 2024, down from 0.30% as of December 31, 2023 and up from 0.04% as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Selected Balance Sheet Items**\n\nThe Company’s total assets were $9.639 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $9.856 billion as of December 31, 2023. Loans receivable were $8.112 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $8.345 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total deposits were $7.524 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $7.536 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company’s total stockholders’ equity was $1.239 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $1.217 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in total stockholders’ equity was primarily attributable to an increase in retained earnings of $28.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses of approximately $1.6 million and increases in treasury stock of approximately $5.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 9.71% and $23.85, respectively, compared to 9.25% and $23.14, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Total goodwill and other intangible assets were $213.3 million as of September 30, 2024, and $214.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), ConnectOne routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP measures. ConnectOne believes these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings release to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call**\n\nManagement will also host a conference call and audio webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET on October 24, 2024 to review the Company's financial performance and operating results.

7:00 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., Sept. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNOB) (\"ConnectOne or “Company\"), parent company of ConnectOne Bank, and The First of Long Island Corporation (Nasdaq: FLIC) (“First of Long Island”), parent company of The First National Bank of Long Island, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which First of Long Island will merge with and into ConnectOne. The combined company will operate under the ConnectOne brand, and will have approximately $14 billion in total assets, $11 billion in total deposits, and $11 billion in total loans.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, First of Long Island shareholders will receive 0.5175 shares of ConnectOne common stock for each share of First of Long Island common stock. The transaction is presently valued at approximately $284 million in the aggregate, or approximately $12.40 per First of Long Island share, based upon the closing common stock price of $23.97 for ConnectOne Bancorp as of September 4, 2024.\n\nFirst of Long Island is headquartered in Melville, NY, and operates 40 branches in the New York Metropolitan area, with approximately 92% of its deposits located in Nassau or Suffolk Counties. As of June 30, 2024, First of Long Island had approximately $4.2 billion of assets, $3.3 billion of loans, and $3.4 billion of deposits. Based on S&P Capital IQ Pro data as of June 30, 2023, First of Long Island is ranked #4 in Nassau County and #5 in Suffolk County in deposit market share among banks under $100 billion of assets.\n\n“We are excited to bring together two highly complementary, commercially focused banks to create a truly premier New York-metro community bank.” said Frank Sorrentino III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ConnectOne Bank. “This transaction is a natural fit as both ConnectOne and First of Long Island share a strong credit culture, a long-term track record of strong financial performance, and a deep commitment to putting clients at the center of our businesses.”\n\nMr. Sorrentino added, “Strategically, this is a compelling transaction which enhances our franchise value, solidifies ConnectOne’s presence in the New York City market and accelerates our Long Island growth strategy. Additionally, adding over $3 billion in deposits, the combination will establish ConnectOne as one of the top 5 banks on Long Island, in terms of deposit market share.”\n\n“Financially, the all-stock transaction will be accretive to earnings and offers positive pro forma benefits while maintaining a rigorous risk management culture and a strong capital and liquidity position. By combining our talents and resources we’re creating a significantly enhanced platform for continued growth while offering our clients an expanded range of services and enhanced capabilities.”\n\n“Joining forces with ConnectOne begins the next chapter in The First National Bank of Long Island’s story. Together, we leverage the strengths, expertise, and resources of both companies to offer our clients the muscle and support of a $14 billion institution with a people-first culture backed by modern infrastructure,” said Chris Becker, CEO of The First National Bank of Long Island. “This partnership is the coming together of two market-adjacent companies that will be positioned for greater success, and I am proud to continue to support the combined company as the Board’s Vice Chairman.”Strategic Transaction Highlights:\n\n  * Creates a premier middle-market bank focused on serving the greater New York metro area\n  * Pro forma company will have significant scale, with $14 billion in assets and a market capitalization of over $1.2 billion, based on ConnectOne’s closing stock price as of September 4, 2024\n  * Transaction allows ConnectOne to leap over the $10 billion threshold with significant scale\n  * Materially enhances ConnectOne’s presence on Long Island – 30% of pro forma deposit franchise to be located in Nassau and Suffolk Counties (based on S&P Capital IQ Pro data as of 6/30/2023)\n  * Highly compatible client-first cultures\n  * Low execution risk – ConnectOne is an experienced acquiror and integrator, and has performed extensive due diligence\n  * ConnectOne already has a high level of familiarity with the Long Island market, having opened its first Long Island branch in 2018\n\n\n\nThe merger is expected to be approximately 36% accretive to ConnectOne’s earnings per share in 2025 as adjusted for an illustrative full phase-in of cost savings. Tangible book value per share dilution is projected at 12%, with an earnback period of approximately 2.9 years. ConnectOne projects to deliver a return on average tangible common equity of approximately 14% and an efficiency ratio of approximately 45% in 2025, adjusted for an illustrative full phase-in of cost savings.\n\nAs part of the transaction, ConnectOne plans to raise approximately $100 million in subordinated debt prior to the transaction closing, the net proceeds of which will be downstreamed in the form of equity capital to ConnectOne Bank.\n\nEffective at the closing of the transaction, Mr. Becker will become Vice Chairman of ConnectOne and two current independent members of First of Long Island’s board will join the Board of Directors of ConnectOne.\n\nThe transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies and is expected to be completed in mid-2025, subject to approval by shareholders of both First of Long Island and ConnectOne, as well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., _A Stifel Company_ , served as financial advisor to ConnectOne and Windels Marx Lane & Mittendorf, LLP served as its legal counsel.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results; Declares Common and Preferred Dividends\n\nCompany Release - 7/25/2024 7:00 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., July 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNOB) (the “Company” or “ConnectOne”), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income available to common stockholders of $17.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared with $15.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $19.9 million for the second quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.46 for the second quarter of 2024 compared with $0.41 for the first quarter of 2024 and $0.51 for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe increase in net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share from the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease to provision for credit losses, a $1.1 million increase in net interest income and a $0.6 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in income tax expense and a $0.5 million increase in noninterest expenses. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders from the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in net interest income and a $2.1 million increase in noninterest expenses, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in noninterest income, a $0.7 million decrease in income tax expense and a $0.5 million decrease to provision for credit losses.\n\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) as a percent of average assets was 1.17%, 1.10% and 1.31% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nFrank Sorrentino, ConnectOne’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Reflecting a commitment to our relationship-banking business model, ConnectOne’s second quarter performance was solid and, we believe, is in the early stages of an upswing. Pre-tax and pre-provision net revenue increased sequentially by an annualized 17%, our net interest margin widened by 8 basis points, and both our loan to deposit and CRE concentration ratios improved.”\n\n“During the second quarter, client deposit balances increased approximately 7% on an annualized basis, with noninterest-bearing demand deposits remaining flat, driven by meaningful growth from existing clients and successfully onboarding new clients to the bank. And while loan originations are continuing at an annualized run-rate of more than $1 billion, our loan portfolio decreased sequentially. This reflected higher pay-downs and pay-offs than usual and was consistent with our strategy to actively manage non-relationship loans off our balance sheet.”\n\nMr. Sorrentino concluded, “While ConnectOne remains focused on investing in our valuable franchise, further strengthening our solid balance sheet, enhancing our core funding and improving our loan mix, it also appears banking industry fundamentals may have turned the corner. Either way, we believe that ConnectOne is poised for sustained growth and long-term profitability.”\n\n**Dividend Declarations**\n\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on both its common stock and its outstanding preferred stock.\n\nA cash dividend on common stock of $0.18 per share will be paid on September 3, 2024, to common stockholders of record on August 15, 2024. A dividend of $0.328125 per depositary share, representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Company’s 5.25% Fixed Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, will also be paid on September 3, 2024 to holders of record on August 15, 2024.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $62.3 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 1.9%, from the first quarter of 2024, due to an eight basis-point widening of the net interest margin to 2.72% from 2.64%, which was partially offset by a $113.2 million, or 1.2%, decrease in average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin widening was primarily due to an eight basis-point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, while the cost to fund those assets remained essentially flat. The decrease in average interest-earning assets from the first quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to a $120.0 million decrease in average loans, reflecting a larger than typical volume of loan payoffs, paydowns and sales.\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 decreased by $2.4 million, or 3.7%, from the second quarter of 2023. The decrease from the second quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from a nine basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.72% from 2.81%, partially offset by a $63.5 million, or 0.8%, increase in average loans. The contraction of the net interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to a 64 basis-point increase in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 42 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.\n\nNoninterest income was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Included in noninterest income were net (losses) gains on equity securities of $(0.2) million, $0.1 million, and $(0.2) million for the second quarter of 2024, first quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2023, respectively. Excluding the equity securities (losses) gains, adjusted noninterest income was $4.6 million, $3.8 million, and $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, first quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2023, respectively. The $0.8 million increase in adjusted noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in net gains on sale of loans held-for-sale. The $1.0 million increase in adjusted noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net gains on loans held-for-sale of $0.7 million, an increase in deposit, loan, and other income of $0.1 million and an increase in BOLI income of $0.1 million.\n\nNoninterest expenses totaled $37.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, $37.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $35.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. The $0.5 million increase from the first quarter of 2024 was attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $0.6 million and other expenses of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in information and technology communications of $0.2 million, marketing and advertising of $0.1 million and occupancy and equipment of $0.1 million. The $2.1 million increase from the second quarter of 2023 was attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $1.0 million, information technology and communications of $0.6 million, other expenses of $0.3 million, occupancy and equipment of $0.2 million and FDIC insurance of $0.1 million. The increase in salaries and employee benefits when compared to the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to increases in incentive-based compensation accruals, partially offset by decreases in payroll tax expenses. The increases in information technology and communications when compared to the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023 are attributable to additional investments in technology, equipment, and software.\n\nIncome tax expense was $6.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $7.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates for the second quarter of 2024, first quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2023 were 26.0%, 25.5% and 25.8%, respectively.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in the current quarter’s provision for credit losses from the first quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in general reserves that resulted from a decrease in loans receivable.\n\nNonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (the Bank had no other real estate owned during the periods reported), were $46.0 million as of June 30, 2024, $52.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and $51.5 million as of June 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.47% as of June 30, 2024, 0.53% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.53% as of June 30, 2023. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to loans receivable was 0.56%, 0.63% and 0.63%, as of June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The annualized net loan charge-offs ratio was 0.16% for the second quarter of 2024, 0.43% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 0.05% for the second quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.01%, 0.98%, and 1.09% of loans receivable as of June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 178.3% as of June 30, 2024, 156.1% as of December 31, 2023 and 173.2% as of June 30, 2023.\n\nCredit quality metrics remained solid. Criticized and classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 1.50% as of June 30, 2024 versus 1.35% as of December 31, 2023 and decreased from 1.70% as of June 30, 2023. Loans delinquent 30 to 89 days were 0.11% of loans as of June 30, 2024 down from 0.30% as of December 31, 2023 and up from 0.04% as of June 30, 2023.\n\n**Selected Balance Sheet Items**\n\nThe Company’s total assets were $9.724 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $9.856 billion as of December 31, 2023. Loans receivable were $8.158 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $8.345 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total deposits were $7.576 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $7.536 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company’s total stockholders’ equity was $1.224 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $1.217 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in total stockholders’ equity was primarily attributable to an increase in retained earnings of approximately $20 million, partially offset by increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $7 million and increases in treasury stock of approximately $6 million. As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 9.46% and $23.45, respectively, compared to 9.25% and $23.14, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Total goodwill and other intangible assets were $213.6 million as of June 30, 2024, and $214.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), ConnectOne routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP measures. ConnectOne believes these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Results; Declares Preferred and Increased Common Dividends\n\nCompany Release - 4/25/2024 7:00 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nENGLEWOOD CLIFFS. N.J., April 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNOB) (the “Company” or “ConnectOne”), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income available to common stockholders of $15.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared with $17.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $23.4 million for the first quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 for the first quarter of 2024 compared with $0.46 for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $0.59 for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in net interest income, a $1.3 million increase to the provision for credit losses, and a $0.4 million decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in income tax expense and a $0.8 million decrease in noninterest expenses. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders from the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $6.8 million decrease in net interest income, a $3.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses, and a $2.2 million increase in noninterest expenses, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in income tax expense and a $1.1 million increase in noninterest income.\n\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) as a percent of average assets was 1.10%, 1.15% and 1.46% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n“ConnectOne moved through the first quarter laser-focused on furthering our relationship-banking model, despite the challenging backdrop. Our team seized opportunities to expand our client base, strengthen our team by adding top-performing talent all while building into new markets.” commented Frank Sorrentino, ConnectOne’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n“In the first quarter, our team increased client deposit balances sequentially by an annualized 3.2%, driven by 9.9% annualized noninterest-bearing demand deposit growth. Loan balances were down sequentially by an annualized 2.3%, primarily a result of intentionally lower multifamily and other commercial real estate balances, contributing to both a lower loan-to-deposit ratio and lower commercial real estate concentration.” Mr. Sorrentino added, “For the first quarter, while our net interest margin (“NIM”) compressed sequentially by seven basis points, we are already today seeing a gradual expansion of the NIM, even ahead of potential Fed rate cuts.”\n\n“Meanwhile, our tangible common equity ratio remained flat at 9.25%, notwithstanding the repurchase of 282,370 shares during the quarter, and our tangible book value per share increased to $23.26. We’re also pleased to announce a 5.9% increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.18, reflecting our ongoing commitment to maximize shareholder value.”\n\n**Dividend Declarations**\n\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared an increased quarterly cash dividend on its common stock and declared a cash dividend on its outstanding preferred stock.\n\nA cash dividend on common stock of $0.18 per share, reflecting a 5.9% sequential increase, will be paid on June 3, 2024, to common stockholders of record on May 15, 2024. A dividend of $0.328125 per depositary share, representing a 1/40th interest in the Company’s 5.25% Fixed Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, will also be paid on June 3, 2024 to preferred stockholders of record on May 15, 2024.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $61.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 2.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2023 due to a seven basis-point contraction in the net interest margin to 2.64% from 2.71%, partially offset by a $151.1 million, or 1.6%, increase in average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin contraction was primarily due to a nine basis-point increase in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing demand, to 3.23%, and an increase in average cash and cash equivalents of $84.0 million, partially offset by a one basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield to 5.82%. The increase in average interest-earning assets from the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to the aforementioned $84.0 million increase in average cash and cash equivalents and a $64.5 million increase in average loans.\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 decreased by $6.7 million, or 9.9%, from the first quarter of 2023. The decrease from the first quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from a 36 basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.64% from 3.00%, partially offset by a $149.1 million, or 1.6%, increase in average interest-earning assets. The contraction of the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to a 103 basis-point increase in the average costs of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 47 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.\n\nNoninterest income was $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Included in noninterest income were net gains (losses) on equity securities of $0.1 million, $0.6 million, and $(0.2) million for the first quarter of 2024, fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2023, respectively. Excluding the equity securities gains (losses), adjusted noninterest income was $3.8 million, $3.7 million, and $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2023, respectively. The $0.1 million increase in adjusted noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $0.1 million increase in deposit, loan, and other income. The $0.8 million increase in adjusted noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net gains on loans held-for-sale, primarily SBA, of $0.5 million, an increase in deposit, loan, and other income of $0.2 million and an increase in BOLI income of $0.1 million.\n\nNoninterest expenses totaled $37.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, $37.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $34.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. Included in noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 was a $2.1 million FDIC special assessment. Excluding the assessment, adjusted noninterest expenses totaled $35.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $1.3 million when compared to the adjusted noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in marketing and advertising of $0.4 million, occupancy and equipment of $0.3 million, professional and consulting of $0.3 million, information and technology communications of $0.2 million, and salaries and employee benefits of $0.1 million. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $2.2 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in information technology and communications of $1.3 million, FDIC insurance of $0.9 million, and occupancy and equipment of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in professional and consulting of $0.2 million and salaries and employee benefits of $0.1 million. The increases in information technology and communications when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023 are attributable to additional investments in technology, equipment, and software. The increase in FDIC insurance expense when compared to the first quarter of 2023 is primarily attributable to balance sheet growth and a two-basis point increase in the Bank’s initial base rate. The increase in salaries and employee benefits when compared to the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to new hires and seasonal increases in payroll taxes.\n\nIncome tax expense was $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2024, $6.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $9.1 million for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates for the first quarter of 2024, fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2023 were 25.5%, 24.4% and 26.7%, respectively.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the current quarter’s provision for credit losses from the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected increases in changes in macroeconomic forecasts, qualitative factors and specific reserves.\n\nNonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (the Bank had no other real estate owned during the periods reported), were $47.4 million as of March 31, 2024, $52.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and $47.7 million as of March 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.48% as of March 31, 2024, 0.53% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.48% as of March 31, 2023. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to loans receivable was 0.57%, 0.63% and 0.59%, as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, one loan for $23.6 million was past due more than 90 days and still accruing; the loan is well-secured at a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 60% and is in the process of collection. The annualized net loan charge-offs ratio was 0.15% for the first quarter of 2024, 0.43% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 0.22% for the first quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.00%, 0.98%, and 1.07% of loans receivable as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 174.7% as of March 31, 2024, 156.1% as of December 31, 2023 and 182.5% as of March 31, 2023.\n\nCriticized and classified loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 1.30% as of March 31, 2024 versus 1.35% as of December 31, 2023 and 1.74% as of March 31, 2023. Loans delinquent 30 to 89 days were 0.04% of loans as of March 31, 2024 down from 0.30% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.17% as of March 31, 2023.\n\n**Selected Balance Sheet Items**\n\nThe Company’s total assets were $9.854 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $9.856 billion as of December 31, 2023. Loans receivable was $8.298 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $8.345 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total deposits were $7.589 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $7.536 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company’s total stockholders’ equity was $1.217 billion at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

ConnectOne believes these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings release to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables.\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call**\n\nManagement will also host a conference call and audio webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET on April 25, 2024 to review the Company's financial performance and operating results.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Results; Declares Common and Preferred Dividends\n\nCompany Release - 1/25/2024 7:00 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., Jan. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNOB) (the “Company” or “ConnectOne”), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income available to common stockholders of $17.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $19.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $31.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $0.46 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $0.51 for the third quarter of 2023 and $0.79 for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $2.1 million FDIC special assessment recognized during the fourth quarter of 2023, a $1.2 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a $0.5 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in income tax expense and a $0.6 million increase in noninterest income. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders from the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily due to a $16.2 million decrease in net interest income, a $4.5 million increase in noninterest expenses, which included the $2.1 million FDIC special assessment, partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in income tax expense, a $0.7 million increase in noninterest income and a $0.6 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. Full-year 2023 net income available to common stockholders was $81.0 million, compared to $119.2 million for 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the full-year 2023 was $2.07, compared with $3.01 for 2022.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.50 (excluding the FDIC special assessment) for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $0.51 for the third quarter of 2023 and $0.79 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) as a percent of average assets was 1.24% (excluding the FDIC special assessment), 1.24% and 2.02% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nFrank Sorrentino, ConnectOne’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “While 2023 was marked by significant challenges in the banking industry, I’m proud to report that with the strength of our balance sheet, our culture and the commitment to our clients, we were able to stay the course and continue on the path that has made ConnectOne a success since our inception nearly twenty years ago. Earnings, without a doubt, were challenged by the Fed’s unprecedented tightening, causing net interest margins to contract materially. Yet, we were able to increase our tangible book value per share in 2023 by more than 6%, build capital, maintain solid credit quality with best-in-class efficiency, attract new talent to the organization, and continue our investment in technology initiatives. At ConnectOne, we ran counter to industry trends, and remained steadfast to our strategy of building relationship-focused business, rewarding our lending and support teams, and organically and opportunistically building our geographic reach. This philosophy positions us to outperform in 2024 and beyond.”\n\n“Reflecting our long-standing focus on relationship-based lending, we had solid sequential C&I loan growth of 6.8% during the fourth quarter and stabilized noninterest-bearing demand deposits. We remain disciplined, maintaining our sound approach to both credit as well as spreads and, given the market, currently anticipate continued gradual growth in 2024.” Mr. Sorrentino added, “Trends for net interest margin, which compressed by 5 basis points sequentially during the fourth quarter, seem to be stabilizing. We’re seeing a flattening of deposit costs and anticipate that the margin will widen as the Fed eases its interest rate stance.”\n\n“Dating back to year-end 2021, prior to the Fed tightening, our tangible book value has increased by $3.02, or more than 15%,” Mr. Sorrentino commented. “Additionally, while ConnectOne’s efficiency ratio has been impacted by compressing margins, our annualized expenses remain below 1.5% of average assets, placing us in the top tier of efficiency among banks.”\n\nMr. Sorrentino concluded, “Looking ahead, we have the financial strength, balance sheet, and talent to support our approach and enter 2024 confident in our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities to enhance ConnectOne’s valuable franchise.” \n\n**Dividend Declarations**\n\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock and declared a cash dividend on its outstanding preferred stock.\n\nA cash dividend on common stock of $0.17 will be paid on March 1, 2024, to common stockholders of record on February 15, 2024. A dividend of $0.328125 per depositary share, representing a 1/40th interest in the Company’s 5.25% Fixed Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, will also be paid on March 1, 2024 to preferred stockholders of record on February 15, 2024.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $62.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 0.9%, from the third quarter of 2023 due to a 5 basis-point contraction in the net interest margin to 2.71% from 2.76%, partially offset by an $82.7 million, or 0.9%, increase in average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin contraction was due to a 22 basis-point increase in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing demand, to 3.14%, and was partially offset by an 18 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield to 5.81%. The increase in average interest-earning assets from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to a $99.0 million increase in average loans, partially offset by a decrease in average cash and cash equivalents of $24.0 million.\n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $16.1 million, or 20.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted primarily from a 77 basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.71% from 3.48%, partially offset by an increase in interest-earning assets of $0.2 billion. The contraction of the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to a 168 basis-point increase in the average costs of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 61 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.\n\nNoninterest income was $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Included in noninterest income were net gains (losses) on equity securities of $0.6 million, $(0.3) million, and $(0.1) million for the fourth quarter of 2023, third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. Excluding the equity securities gains (losses), adjusted noninterest income was $3.6 million, $3.8 million and $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. The $0.2 million decrease in adjusted noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in net gains on loans held-for-sale of $0.2 million. The net gains on loans held-for-sale consisted primarily of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. The $0.1 million increase in adjusted noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily due to an increase in net gains on loans held-for-sale, primarily SBA, of $0.3 million and an increase in BOLI of $0.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in deposit, loan, and other income of $0.3 million.\n\nNoninterest expenses totaled $37.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $33.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Included in noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 was a $2.1 million FDIC special assessment. Excluding the assessment, adjusted noninterest expenses totaled $35.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted noninterest expenses were flat from the third quarter of 2023. The following components made up the change between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2023: an increase of $0.7 million in information technology and communication, offset by decreases in professional and consulting of $0.3 million, marketing and advertising of $0.2 million and salaries and employee benefits of $0.2 million. The increase in adjusted noninterest expenses of $2.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to increases in information technology and communications of $1.5 million, FDIC insurance of $1.0 million, salaries and employee benefits of $0.3 million, and other expenses of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in professional and consulting of $0.6 million and marketing and advertising of $0.1 million. The increase in information technology and communications when compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022 is primarily attributable to additional investments in technology, equipment, and software.\n\nIncome tax expense was $6.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $12.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The effective tax rates for the fourth quarter of 2023, third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022 were 24.4%, 25.2% and 27.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate when compared to the third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022 is largely attributable to lower taxable income.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in the provision for credit losses between the third and fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflected loan growth.\n\nDuring the current quarter the Company charged-off $3.9 million of previously-reserved-for taxi medallion loans. The taxi charge-off had no impact on credit loss provisioning or earnings, it increased the annualized quarterly charge-off rate and reduced nonaccrual loans. Total nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, were $52.5 million as of December 31, 2023, $56.1 million as of September 30, 2023 and $44.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Nonaccrual loans were $52.5 million as of December 31, 2023, $56.1 million as of September 30, 2023 and $44.5 million as of December 31, 2022. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.53% as of December 31, 2023, 0.58% as of September 30, 2023 and 0.46% as of December 31, 2022. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to loans receivable was 0.63%, 0.69% and 0.55%, as of December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The annualized net loan charge-offs ratio was 0.43% (0.24%, excluding the above-mentioned taxi charge-off) for the fourth quarter of 2023, 0.12% for the third quarter of 2023 and 0.23% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.98%, 1.08%, and 1.12% of loans receivable as of December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 156.1% as of December 31, 2023, 157.4% as of September 30, 2023 and 203.6% as of December 31, 2022.

The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable of $245 million, partially offset by decreases in interest-bearing deposits with banks of $25 million and investment securities of $18 million. Loans receivable was $8.345 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $8.100 billion as of December 31, 2022. Total deposits were $7.536 billion, an increase of $180 million from December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company’s total stockholders’ equity was $1.217 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $38 million from December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in retained earnings of $55 million, partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $17 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 9.25% and $23.14, respectively, increases from 9.04% and $21.71, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Total goodwill and other intangible assets were $214.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and $215.7 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased 102,200 shares of common stock at an average price of $21.17, leaving 923,488 shares authorized for repurchase under the current Board approved repurchase program. The Company may repurchase shares from time-to-time in the open market, in privately negotiated stock purchases or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable federal securities laws. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the plan may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), ConnectOne routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP measures. ConnectOne believes these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings release to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call**\n\nManagement will also host a conference call and audio webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET on January 25, 2024 to review the Company's financial performance and operating results.

ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. assumes no\nobligation to update forward-looking statements at any time.\nHistorical Development of Business\nConnectOne Bancorp, Inc., (the “Company” and with ConnectOne Bank, “we” or “us”) a one-bank holding company, was incorporated in the State of\nNew Jersey on November 12, 1982 as Center Bancorp, Inc. and commenced operations on May 1, 1983 upon the acquisition of all outstanding shares of capital\nstock of Union Center National Bank, its then principal subsidiary.\nOn January 20, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc., a New\nJersey corporation (“Legacy ConnectOne”).

Also, at closing, the Company changed its name\nto “ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc.” and changed its NASDAQ trading symbol to “CNOB”. Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, Union Center\nNational Bank merged with and into ConnectOne Bank, a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank (“ConnectOne Bank” or the “Bank”) and a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Legacy ConnectOne, with ConnectOne Bank continuing as the surviving bank.\nOn July 11, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Greater Hudson Bank (“GHB”), under which GHB merged with\nand into ConnectOne Bank, with ConnectOne Bank as the surviving bank. This transaction was consummated effective January 2, 2019. As part of this merger,\nthe Company acquired approximately $0.4 billion in loans, assumed approximately $0.4 billion in deposits and acquired seven branch offices located in\nRockland, Orange and Westchester, Counties, New York.\nOn May 31, 2019, the Company, through the Bank, completed its purchase of all of the assets of New York/Boston-based BoeFly, LLC and\ncontributed them to its newly formed subsidiary, BoeFly, Inc (“BoeFly”). BoeFly’s online business lending marketplace helps connect small- to medium-size\nbusinesses, primarily franchisors and franchisees, with professional loan brokers and lenders across the United States. BoeFly operates as an independent brand\nand subsidiary of the Bank.\n-5-\nTable of Contents\nOn January 2, 2020, the Company completed its in-market merger with Bergen County, New Jersey based Bancorp of New Jersey, Inc.

All of BNJ’s\noffices were located in Bergen County, New Jersey. As part of this merger, the Company acquired approximately $0.8 billion in loans and assumed\napproximately $0.8 billion in deposits.\nThe Company’s primary activity, at this time, is to act as a holding company for the Bank and its other subsidiaries.

It operates primarily through its bank subsidiary,\nConnectOne Bank.\nConnectOne Bank is a high-performing commercial bank offering a full suite of deposit and loan products and services to the general public,\nprimarily to small and mid-sized businesses, local professionals and individuals residing, working and conducting business in the New York Metropolitan area\nand the South Florida market served by our West Palm Beach office. The Bank’s continuous investments in technology coupled with top talent allow\nConnectOne to operate a “branch-lite” model, making for a highly efficient operating environment.\nBoeFly, a wholly owned subsidiary of ConnectOne Bank, is a fintech marketplace that connects borrowers in the franchise space with funding\nsolutions through a network of partner banks, including the Bank.\n-6-\nTable of Contents\nOur Market Area\nConnectOne Bank's offices are located primarily in the New York metro market and span New Jersey, New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson\nValley, including Rockland, Orange, and Westchester counties. Through high tech tools and service, the Bank is able to extend its reach supporting clients as\nthey move into new markets, such as South Florida where we opened an office in West Palm Beach in August 2022. Our market area includes some of the most\nrobust markets in the United States. The Bank's goal is to continue to expand and do business to support our clients as they grow. Advances in technology have\ncreated new delivery channels that allow us to service clients and maintain business relationships with a reduced-branch model, establishing regional offices\nthat serve as business hubs. The Bank's experience has shown that the key to client acquisition and retention is attracting quality business relationship officers\nwho will frequently go to the client, rather than having the client come to us.\nBoeFly operates out of its main offices in Boston, Massachusetts and New York, and has a nationwide presence through its digital business\nmarketplace.\nProducts and Services\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from net interest income (i.e., the difference between the interest we receive on our loans and investment\nsecurities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings). We offer a broad range of deposit and loan products. In addition, to attract the business of\nconsumer and business clients, we provide an extensive array of other banking services. Products and services provided include personal and business checking\naccounts, money market accounts, time and savings accounts, credit cards, wire transfers, safe deposit boxes, access to automated teller services and telephone,\ninternet and mobile banking. We offer retirement accounts to consumers and cash management services to business clients that include TreasuryDirect,\nAutomated Clearing House origination, Remote Deposit Capture and digital invoicing.\nNoninterest bearing demand deposit products include “Totally Free Checking” and “Simply Better Checking” for consumer clients and “Small\nBusiness Checking” and “Analysis Checking” for commercial clients. Interest-bearing checking accounts require minimum balances for both consumer and\ncommercial clients and include “Consumer Interest Checking” and “Business Interest Checking”. Money market accounts consist of products that provide a\nmarket rate of interest to depositors. Our savings accounts offer paper and/or electronic statements. Time deposits (\"TD\") are for non-retirement and IRA\naccounts, generally with initial maturities ranging from 31 days to 60 months, and brokered TDs, which we use for asset liability management purposes and to\nupplement other sources of funding. Many of our deposit products can be accessed through both our branches and online to provide ease of access to our\nclients and communities. CDARS/ICS reciprocal deposits are offered based on the Bank’s participation in the IntraFi Network LLC (\"the network\"), formerly\nknown as Promontory Interfinancial Network. Clients, who are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance sensitive, are able to place large\ndollar deposits with the Company and the Company utilizes CDARS to place those funds into certificates of deposit issued by other banks in the Network. This\noccurs in increments of less than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage in amounts larger\nhan the insured dollar amount. Unless certain conditions are satisfied, the FDIC considers these funds as brokered deposits.\nDeposits serve as the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets, but also generate noninterest revenue through insufficient funds fees,\nstop payment fees, wire transfer fees, safe deposit rental fees, debit card income, including foreign ATM fees and credit and debit card interchange, and other\nmiscellaneous fees. In addition, the Bank generates additional noninterest revenue associated with residential, commercial and Small Business Administration\n(“SBA”) loan originations and sales, loan servicing, late fees and merchant services.\nWe offer consumer and commercial business loans on a secured and unsecured basis, revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgage loans, and\nresidential mortgages on both primary and secondary residences, home equity loans, bridge loans and other personal purpose loans. However, we are not and\nhave not historically been a participant in the sub-prime lending market.\nCommercial loans are loans made for business purposes and are primarily secured by collateral such as business assets including accounts receivable,\ninventory and equipment. These facilities can also be secured by cash balances with the Bank, marketable securities held by or under the control of the Bank,\nand commercial and residential real estate.\nCommercial construction loans are loans to finance the construction of commercial or residential properties secured by first liens on such properties.\nCommercial real estate loans include loans secured by first liens on completed commercial properties, including multifamily properties, to purchase or\nrefinance such properties, as well as land loans. Residential mortgages include loans secured by first liens on 1-4 family, 1-4 family investment properties ,\ncondominium and cooperative residential real estate and are generally made to existing clients of the Bank to purchase or refinance primary and secondary\nresidences. Home equity loans and lines of credit include loans secured by first or second liens on residential real estate for primary or secondary residences.\nConsumer loans are made to individuals who qualify for auto loans, cash reserve, credit cards and installment loans.\n-7-\nTable of Contents\nThe Board of Directors has approved a credit policy granting designated lending authorities to the Management Credit Committee and specific officers\nof the Bank. The Management Credit Committee is comprised of six members of senior management, the Bank President, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Lending\nOfficer, two Senior Credit Officers and one Managing Director. The officers are comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Bank President, Chief Credit\nOfficer, Chief Lending Officer, Senior Credit Officers, Managing Directors, Team Leaders and the Consumer Loan Officers. All loan approvals require the\nsignatures of a minimum of two officers. The Management Credit Committee (Bank President, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Lending Officer, two Senior Credit\nOfficers and one Managing Director) can approve loans up to $80 million in aggregate loan exposure with no policy exceptions. Furthermore, the Management\nCredit Committee has authority to approve unsecured loan amounts without policy exceptions up to $40 million. The Senior Lending Group (Chief Executive\nOfficer, President, Chief Credit Officer and Chief Lending Officer) can approve loans up to $35 million in aggregate loan exposure with no policy exceptions\nand up to $30 million with policy exceptions. Furthermore, the Senior Lending Group has authority to approve unsecured loan amounts without policy\nexceptions up to $10 million and up to $5 million with an exception. Loans to insiders must be approved by the entire Board of Directors.\nThe Bank’s lending policies generally provide for lending within our primary trade area. However, the Bank will make loans to people outside of our\nprimary trade area when we deem it prudent to do so. To promote a high degree of asset quality, the Bank focuses primarily upon offering secured loans.\nHowever, the Bank does make short-term unsecured loans to borrowers with higher net worth and income profiles. The Bank generally requires loan clients to\nmaintain deposit accounts with the Bank. In addition, the Bank generally provides a minimum required rate of interest in its variable rate loans. The Bank’s\nlegal lending limit to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank’s capital base (defined as tangible equity plus the allowance for credit losses) for most loans\n($168.2 million) and 25% of the capital base for loans secured by readily marketable collateral ($280.3 million). As of December 31, 2023, the Bank’s largest\ncommitted relationship (to several affiliated borrowers) was $173.6 million, and the single largest loan outstanding was $60.0 million.\nOur business model includes using industry best practices for community banks, including personalized service, state-of-the-art technology, and\nextended hours. We believe that this will generate deposit accounts with somewhat larger average balances than are found at many other financial institutions.\nWe also use pricing techniques in our efforts to attract banking relationships having larger than average balances.\nCompetition\nThe banking business is highly competitive. We face substantial immediate competition and potential future competition both in attracting deposits\nand in originating loans. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, many of which have assets, capital\nand lending limits larger than those that we have. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock\nbrokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities. In addition, the banking industry in\ngeneral faces competition for deposit, credit and money management products from non-bank technology firms, or fintech companies, which may offer\nproducts independently or through relationships with insured depository institutions.\nOur larger competitors have greater financial resources to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns. Additionally, we endeavor to compete for\nbusiness by providing high quality, personal service to clients, client access to our decision-makers and competitive interest rates and fees. We seek to hire and\nretain quality employees who desire greater responsibility than may be available working for a larger employer.\n-8-\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\nThe Company strives to be an employer of choice by creating a working environment that fosters excellence, creativity and professional growth. We\ntrive to challenge our employees to be the best they can be and to provide them with the tools and training they need to help fulfill their critical service\nmandate. We endeavor to build a diverse team of financial experts and relationship specialists who understand the demands of a successful business and are\nprepared to meet them.\nDemographics: As of December 31, 2023, we had 487 full-time employees and 12 part-time and temporary employees. The employees are not\nrepresented by a collective bargaining unit.\nDiversity, Equity, & Inclusion: In 2022, we appointed our first Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer, with a mandate to focus on workforce\ndiversity, vendor/supplier diversity and cultivating more diverse leadership, among other vital issues. Employee resource groups (“ERG”) further support this\noverall commitment and vision, as well as Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging in the workplace. Our first ERG, WomenConnect, was established in\nJanuary 2023 and follows a mission to empower and foster an inclusive environment where all individuals feel connected and make an impact through:\nmentorship, leadership, teamwork in the community, and both professional and personal growth opportunities.\nEducation: We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and\ntransfer from within the organization. We have formalized our commitment to training, education and mentoring through our ConnectOne University program.\nConnectOne University houses our training, leadership development, continuing education and mentorship programs.\nThrough ConnectOne University, employees:\n● Receive and complete required job training related to their position with the Company, such as compliance and ethics training and position\nspecific training. Classes include an ABA approved curriculum as well as other third party and Company proprietary courses;\n● May take classes to attain job specific certifications to help with career development;\n● May take continuing education classes related to other positions and operations at the Company;\n● May take business related continuing education classes at partner community colleges and other institutions through a New Jersey State grant\nprogram;\n● May participate in career mentoring programs in which employees meet with senior officers of the Company to discuss career development;\nand\n● May participate in a tuition reimbursement program under which the Company will reimburse employees for up to $5,250 in tuition expense\nrelated to approved business-related course work at any school.\nDuring 2023, 289 employees participated in our leadership and mentoring programs within ConnectOne University. Additionally, in 2023 we\nidentified two individuals and placed them into a credit rotation program enabling them to move from their current position into a new career path.\nWe also sponsored two employees to attend the Stonier Graduate School of Banking. We sponsor employees on an annual basis. This is a competitive\nprocess requiring an employee to be nominated by the employee’s manager and then participate in a panel interview.

Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company’s cost of doing business and limit the\noptions of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated\nby the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Company or the Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material\nprovisions.\nBank Holding Company Regulation\nThe Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Holding Company Act”). As a bank\nholding company, the Company is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and is required to file reports with the FRB\nand provide such additional information as the FRB may require. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by the FRB.\nThe Holding Company Act prohibits the Company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of\nthe voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or\nfurnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found\nby the FRB to be so closely related to banking “as to be a proper incident thereto.” The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the\nacquisition by the Company of more than 5% of the voting stock of any other bank. Satisfactory capital ratios and Community Reinvestment Act ratings and\nanti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB, embodied in\nFRB regulations, provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank(s) and to\ncommit resources to support the subsidiary bank(s) in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy.\nAs a New Jersey-charted commercial bank and an FDIC-insured institution, acquisitions by the Bank require approval of the New Jersey Department\nof Banking and Insurance (the “Banking Department”) and the FDIC, an agency of the federal government. The Holding Company Act does not place\nterritorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below, allows the\nCompany to expand into insurance, securities, merchant banking activities, and other activities that are financial in nature, in certain circumstances.\nRegulation of Bank Subsidiary\nThe operations of the Bank are subject to requirements and restrictions under federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against\ndeposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of\nservices which may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. There are various legal limitations, including\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding\ncompany or its holding company’s non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Under federal law, a bank subsidiary may only make loans or extensions of credit to, or\ninvest in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries)\nor to any affiliate, or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, upon satisfaction of various regulatory criteria, including specific collateral\nloan to value requirements.\n-11-\nTable of Contents\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, adopted in 2010, will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry as a result of the significant regulatory\nand compliance changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority over troubled and failing banks and\ntheir holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to\nthe FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and\nsoundness for, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial\nsystem to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the FRB, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below:\n• Minimum Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required capital rules and the application of the same leverage and risk-based capital\nrequirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. In addition to making bank holding companies\nsubject to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries, these provisions (often referred to as the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-\nFrank Act) were also intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as\nregulatory capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking regulators to seek to make capital standards countercyclical, so that the required\nlevels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. See “Capital Adequacy\nGuidelines” for a description of capital requirements adopted by U.S. federal banking regulators in 2013 and the treatment of trust preferred\nsecurities under such rules.\n• The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“Bureau”). The Dodd-Frank Act created the Bureau. The Bureau is tasked with establishing and\nimplementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer\nfinancial products and services. The Bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank\nconsumers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those\nregulations promulgated by the Bureau and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the Bureau\nagainst state-chartered institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and\nsavings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for\ncompliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. Although the Bank currently has less than $10 billion in assets, and so is\nnot subject to examination by the Bureau, it is likely that the Bank will exceed $10 billion in total assets in the foreseeable future, and so will\nbecome subject to examination by the Bureau.\n• Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premium paid to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer based on the institution’s deposit\nbase, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank\nAct makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount\nof total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds\ncertain thresholds. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio at 2.0%.\n• Shareholder Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies like the Company to give shareholders a non-binding vote on\nexecutive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments in certain circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the SEC to\npromulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials, which the SEC has\nadopted.\n-12-\nTable of Contents\nAlthough a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, many of the requirements called for\nhave yet to be fully implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. In addition, some of the requirements\nof the Dodd-Frank Act that were implemented have already been revised. See “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act” below.\nGiven the uncertainty associated with the way the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, the full extent of\nthe impact such requirements will have on financial institutions’ operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the\nprofitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio\nrequirements (which, in turn, could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional capital) or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes\nmay also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory\nand regulatory requirements.\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), adopted in May of 2018, was intended to provide regulatory\nrelief to midsized and regional banks. While many of its provisions are aimed at larger institutions, such as raising the threshold to be considered a systemically\nimportant financial institution to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion in assets, many of its provisions will provide regulatory relief to those institutions with\n$10 billion or more in assets, as well as to those institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. Among other things, the EGRRCPA increased the asset\nthreshold for depository institutions and holding companies to perform stress tests required under Dodd Frank from $10 billion to $250 billion, exempted\ninstitutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets from the Volcker Rule, raised the threshold for the requirement that publicly traded holding\ncompanies have a risk committee from $10 billion in consolidated assets to $50 billion in consolidated assets, directed the federal banking agencies to adopt a\n“community bank leverage ratio”, applicable to institutions and holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets, and to provide that compliance with the\nnew ratio would be deemed compliance with all capital requirements applicable to the institution or holding company (See “-Capital Adequacy Guidelines”),\nand provided that residential mortgage loans meeting certain criteria and originated by institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets will be deemed to\nmeet the “ability to repay rule” under the Truth in Lending Act. In addition, the EGRRCPA limited the definition of loans that would be subject to the higher\nrisk weighting applicable to High Volatility Commercial Real Estate.\nCertain of the regulations needed to implement the EGRRCPA have yet to be promulgated by the federal banking agencies, and others have not been\nfully implemented or enforced and so it is still uncertain how full implementation of the EGRRCPA will affect the Company and the Bank.\nRegulation W\nRegulation W codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate\ntransactions. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. The\nCompany is considered to be an affiliate of the Bank. In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to\nengage in “covered transactions” with affiliates:\n• to an amount equal to 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and\n• to an amount equal to 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates.\nIn addition, a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances\nthat are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with\nnonaffiliated companies. A “covered transaction” includes:\n• a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate;\n• a purchase of, or an investment in, securities issued by an affiliate;\n• a purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions;\n• the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party; and\n• the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.\n-13-\nTable of Contents\nFurther, under Regulation W:\n• a bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate;\n• covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are\nconsistent with safe and sound banking practices; and\n• with some exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by certain types of\ncollateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan value, depending on the type of collateral.\nRegulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks which are not “financial subsidiaries” from treatment\nas affiliates, except to the extent that the FRB decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.\nFDICIA\nPursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), each federal banking agency has promulgated\nregulations, specifying the levels at which an insured depository institution such as the Bank would be considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,”\n“undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based\non the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be “well\ncapitalized.”\nThe FDIC’s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total\nrisk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, (iv) has a\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as “adequately capitalized” if it\n(i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0%,\nhas a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and (v) does not meet the definition of “well capitalized.” An institution will be classified as\n“undercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, (iii) has a Tier 1\nleverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution will be classified as “significantly\nundercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, (iii) has a Tier 1\nleverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less 3.0%. An institution will be classified as “critically undercapitalized” if\nit has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0%. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization\ncategory if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.\nIn addition, significant provisions of FDICIA required federal banking regulators to impose standards in a number of other important areas to assure\nbank safety and soundness, including internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, credit underwriting, asset growth, compensation, loan\ndocumentation and interest rate exposure.\n-14-\nTable of Contents\nCapital Adequacy Guidelines\nIn December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) published the final texts of reforms on\ncapital and liquidity generally referred to as “Basel III.” In July 2013, the FRB, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules (the “New\nRules”), which implement certain provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder the New Rules, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets:\n● Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% (the “CET1”);\n● Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1 capital plus “Additional Tier 1 capital”) of 6.0%; and\n● Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) of 8.0%.\nIn addition, the Company and the Bank will be subject to a leverage ratio of 4% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported\non the consolidated financial statements).\nThe New Rules also require a “capital conservation buffer.” Under this provision, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain a 2.5% capital\nconservation buffer, which is composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios described above, resulting in the following\nminimum capital ratios:\n● CET1 of 7%;\n● Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.5%; and\n● Total Capital Ratio of 10.5%.\nThe purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1, Tier 1 Capital\nRatio and Total Capital Ratio above the minimum set forth above but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay\ndividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall.\nThe implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased in on January 1, 2019.\nThe New Rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to CET1. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent\nupon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the\nextent that any one of those categories exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.\nUnder the New Rules, banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank may make a one-time permanent election regarding the treatment of\naccumulated other comprehensive income items in determining regulatory capital ratios. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank elected to\nexclude accumulated other comprehensive income items for purposes of determining regulatory capital.\nWhile the New Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual\npreferred stock, holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, may permanently\ninclude non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until\nthey redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.\n-15-\nTable of Contents\nThe New Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Depending on the nature of the assets, the risk categories\ngenerally range from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of\nasset categories. In addition, the New Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a\nqualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.\nConsistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the New Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets.\nIn December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit\nloss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations’ implementation of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“CECL”). The Company adopted the CECL standard effective January 1, 2021.\nOn September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule providing simplified capital requirements for certain community banking\norganizations (banks and holding companies) with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, implementing provisions of EGRRCPA discussed above.\nUnder the rule, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework or continue to measure\ncapital under the existing Basel III requirements set forth in the New Rules. The new rule took effect January 1, 2020, and qualifying community banking\norganizations could elect to opt into the new community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) in their call report for the first quarter of 2020.\nA qualifying community banking organization (“QCBO”) is defined as a bank, a savings association, a bank holding company or a savings and loan\nholding company with:\n● a leverage capital ratio of greater than 9.0%;\n● total consolidated assets of less than $10.0 billion;\n● total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or\nless of total consolidated assets; and\n● total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets.\nA QCBO opting into the CBLR must maintain a CBLR of 9.0%, subject to a two-quarter grace period to come back into compliance, provided that the\nQCBO maintains a leverage ratio of more than 8.0% during the grace period. A QCBO failing to satisfy these requirements must comply with the Basel III\nrequirements as implemented by the New Rules. The numerator of the CBLR is Tier 1 capital, as calculated under present rules. The denominator of the CBLR\nis the QCBO’s average assets, calculated in accordance with the QCBO’s Call Report instructions and less assets deducted from Tier 1 capital.\nThe Company and the Bank have elected not to opt into the CBLR.\nFederal Deposit Insurance and Premiums\nThe deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance\nassessments to maintain the DIF.\nThe assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. In connection\nwith adopting this assessment base calculation, the FDIC lowered total base assessment rates to between 2.5 and 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk\ncategory, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. The Company paid $5.7 million and $2.8 million in total FDIC assessments in 2023\nand 2022, respectively. The increase from 2023 was attributable to balance sheet growth and a two-basis point increase in the Bank’s initial base rate.\n-16-\nTable of Contents\nThe FDIC has a designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits, of 1.35%. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to\noffset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of\n1.15%.\nThe FDIC Board of Directors approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF)\nassociated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI\nAct) requires the FDIC to take this action in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023.\nThe assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s (IDI’s) estimated uninsured deposits reported as of\nDecember 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion, applicable either to the IDI, if an IDI is not a subsidiary of a holding company, or at the banking\norganization level, to the extent that an IDI is part of a holding company with one or more subsidiary IDIs. The special assessment will be collected at an\nannual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods. The special assessment will be collected beginning\nwith the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024) with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024. The Company\naccrued $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023 related to this special assessment.\nBecause the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC could:\n● Cease collection early, if it has collected enough to recover actual or estimated losses;\n● Extend the special assessment collection period one or more quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, if actual or estimated losses\nexceed the amounts collected; and\n● Impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis after the receiverships for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank terminate, if actual\nlosses exceed the amounts collected.\n-17-\nTable of Contents\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Modernization Act”):\n● allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital, and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially\nbroader range of non-banking activities than previously was permissible, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking\ninvestments in commercial and financial companies, if the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company.\nThereafter it may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals;\n● allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks;\n● removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory\ncompanies; and\n● establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.\nThe Modernization Act also modified other financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment. The Company has\nelected not to become a financial holding company.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nUnder the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as implemented by FDIC regulations, an insured depository institution has a continuing and\naffirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to\ndevelop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in\nconnection with its examination of every bank, to assess the bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in\nits evaluation of certain applications by such bank. Regulations implementing the CRA were substantially revised in 2023 and the changes will begin to become\neffective over the next several years. The Company is studying the revisions to determine the impact on its operations, which is uncertain at this time.\n-18-\nTable of Contents\nUSA PATRIOT Act\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA\nPATRIOT Act”) gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through domestic security measures, surveillance powers, information sharing,\nand anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act encourages information-sharing among\nbank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of\nfinancial institutions, including banks, thrift institutions, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity\nExchange Act.\nAmong other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act imposes the following requirements with respect to financial institutions:\n● All financial institutions must establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum: (i) internal policies, procedures, and\ncontrols; (ii) specific designation of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training programs; and (iv) an\nindependent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program.\n● The Secretary of the Department of Treasury, in conjunction with other bank regulators, is authorized to issue regulations that provide for\nminimum standards with respect to client identification at the time new accounts are opened.\n● Financial institutions that establish, maintain, administer, or manage private banking accounts or correspondent accounts in the United\nStates for non-United States persons or their representatives (including foreign individuals visiting the United States) are required to\nestablish appropriate, specific and, where necessary, enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect and\nreport money laundering.\n● Financial institutions are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts for foreign shell\nbanks (foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any country), and will be subject to certain record keeping obligations with\nrespect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks.\n● Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal\nReserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications.\nThe United States Treasury Department has issued a number of implementing regulations which address various requirements of the USA PATRIOT\nAct and are applicable to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies,\nprocedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their clients.\n-19-\nTable of Contents\nLoans to Related Parties\nThe Company’s authority to extend credit to its directors and executive officers, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed\nby the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation O promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that\nextensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than,\nthose prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other\nunfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are\nbased, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital. In addition, the Bank’s Board of Directors must approve all extensions of credit to insiders.\nDividend Restrictions\nThe Parent Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Virtually all the revenue of the Parent Corporation available for payment\nof dividends on its capital stock will result from amounts paid to the Parent Corporation by the Bank. All such dividends are subject to the laws of the State of\nNew Jersey, the Banking Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) and the regulations of the Banking Department and of the FDIC.\nUnder the New Jersey Corporation Act, the Parent Corporation is permitted to pay cash dividends provided that the payment does not leave us\ninsolvent. As a bank holding company under the BHCA, we would be prohibited from paying cash dividends if we are not in compliance with any capital\nrequirements applicable to us, including our required capital conservation buffer. However, as a practical matter, for so long as our major operations consist of\nownership of the Bank, the Bank will remain our source of dividend payments, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to any restrictions applicable to\nthe Bank.\nThe Parent Corporation has a series of outstanding perpetual preferred stock, our 5.25% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,\nSeries A. The rights of the preferred stockholders to receive dividends are senior to the rights of our common holders, although the preferred dividend rights are\nnon-cumulative. Therefore, unless all dividends due on our outstanding preferred stock have been declared and paid for the most recent dividend period, we\nmay not pay a dividend on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nUnder the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, dividends may be paid by the Bank only if, after the payment of the dividend, the capital\nstock of the Bank will be unimpaired and either the Bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not\nreduce the Bank’s surplus. The payment of dividends is also dependent upon the Bank’s ability to maintain adequate capital ratios pursuant to applicable\nregulatory requirements.\nThe FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB’s policies provide that\ndividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent\nwith the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. FRB regulations also require that a bank holding company serve as a source\nof financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of\nfinancial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary\nbanks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank\nbecomes undercapitalized, and under regulations implementing the Basel III accord, a bank holding company’s ability to pay cash dividends may be impaired if\nit fails to satisfy certain capital buffer requirements. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in\ncapital distributions.\n-20-\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risks. Stockholders should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information\ncontained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making any purchase or sale decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following risks actually\noccur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our securities may decline, and stockholders may\nlose part or all of their investment in our securities.\nRisks Applicable to Our Business:\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition, and such effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and its variants and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus and\nchanges in customer, employer and employee behavior have weighed on and may continue to effect the macroeconomic environment in our New Jersey/New\nYork metropolitan market trade area and have caused economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the\npandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and that of our clients, employees and third-party service\nproviders. The extent of such an impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.\n-21-\nTable of Contents\nOur growth-oriented business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees or if we lose the services of\nour senior management team.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on our management and operations that may result from growth. Our\nability to manage growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. The loss of members of our senior management\nteam, including those officers named in the summary compensation table of our proxy statement, could have a material adverse effect on our results or\noperations and ability to execute our strategic goals. Our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement\nand improve our operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent client relationships and to hire, train and manage our employees.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to execute our growth-oriented business strategy.\nIn order to continue our growth, we will be required to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at levels higher than the minimum ratios set by our\nregulators. We can offer you no assurances that we will be able to raise capital in the future, or that the terms of any such capital will be beneficial to our\nexisting security holders. In the event we are unable to raise capital in the future, we may not be able to continue our growth strategy.\nWe have a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans.\nOur loan portfolio is made up largely of commercial real estate loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to a higher degree of credit risk\nof non-payment and loss than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors, including dependence on the successful operation of a business or a\nproject for repayment, and loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term. In addition, commercial real estate loans\ntypically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nUnderwriting and portfolio management activities cannot completely eliminate all risks related to these loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our\nclients or a significant default by our clients would materially and adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $6.5 billion of commercial real estate loans (nonowner-occupied, owner-occupied multifamily and land), including\nconstruction loans, which represented 78.1% of loans receivable. Concentrations in commercial real estate are monitored by regulatory agencies and subject to\nscrutiny. Guidance from these regulatory agencies includes all commercial real estate loans, including commercial construction loans, in calculating our\ncommercial real estate concentration, but excludes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Based on this regulatory definition, our commercial real estate\nloans represented 463% of the Bank’s Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses on loans.\nLoans secured by owner-occupied real estate are reliant on the operating businesses to provide cash flow to meet debt service obligations, and as a\nresult may be more susceptible to the general impact on the economic environment affecting those operating companies as well as the real estate.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of remote work or hybrid work models on the metropolitan New York area commercial\nreal estate market is uncertain, causing volatility in rents in certain core urban markets. Many other factors, including the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar,\npotential international trade tariffs, inflation and changes in federal tax laws affecting the deductibility of state and local taxes and mortgage interest could\nnegatively impact our local economy and real estate market. Accordingly, it may be more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a\ntimely manner, as commercial real estate borrowers’ ability to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development and leasing of their\nproperties. The deterioration of one or a few of our commercial real estate loans could cause a material increase in our level of nonperforming loans, which\nwould result in a loss of revenue from these loans and could result in an increase in the provision for credit losses and/or an increase in charge-offs, all of which\ncould have a material adverse impact on our net income. We also may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental\nrates, which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. Any weakening of the\ncommercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default on these loans, which could negatively impact our loan portfolio’s performance and asset\nquality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, we could incur material\nlosses. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management time and attention, and materially and adversely affect us.\n-22-\nTable of Contents\nFederal banking agencies have issued guidance regarding high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within bank loan portfolios. The\nguidance requires financial institutions that exceed certain levels of commercial real estate lending compared with their total capital to maintain heightened risk\nmanagement practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of\nunderwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to\nsupport the level of commercial real estate lending. If there is any deterioration in our commercial real estate portfolio or if our regulators conclude that we\nhave not implemented appropriate risk management practices, it could adversely affect our business, and could result in the requirement to maintain increased\ncapital levels. Such capital may not be available at that time and may result in our regulators requiring us to reduce our concentration on commercial real estate\nloans.\nIf we are limited in our ability to originate loans secured by commercial real estate, we may face greater risk in our loan portfolio.\nIf, because of our concentration of commercial real estate loans, or for any other reasons, we are limited in our ability to originate loans secured by\ncommercial real estate, we may incur greater risk in our loan portfolio. For example, we are and may continue to seek to further increase our growth rate in\ncommercial and industrial loans, including both secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of\nrisk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers’ businesses and personal\nguarantees. Secured commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the\nborrower and typically include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value\nis harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly, and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Therefore, we may be exposed to greater risk of loss\non these credits.\nThe nature and growth rate of our commercial loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks.\nGiven the significant growth in our loan portfolio, many of our commercial real estate loans are unseasoned, meaning that they originated relatively\nrecently. As of December 31, 2023, we had $5.9 billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding. Approximately 64.5% of the loans, or $3.8 billion,\nwere originated in the past three years. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency\nor charge-off levels above our expectations, which could negatively affect our performance.\nThe small-to medium-sized businesses that the Bank lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a\nborrower’s ability to repay a loan to the Bank that could materially harm our operating results.\nThe Bank targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small-to medium-\nsized businesses. These small-to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic\ndownturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of\nthese factors may impair the borrower’s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to medium-sized business often depends on the management\ntalents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact our market areas could\ncause the Bank to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our\nperformance.\nOur reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our\nreputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve,\ndelivering superior service to our clients and caring about our clients and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or\notherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in New Jersey corporate law may make it difficult and expensive to remove current\nmanagement.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in New Jersey law may render the removal of our existing board of directors and\nmanagement more difficult. Consequently, it may be difficult and expensive for our stockholders to remove current management, even if current management\nis not performing adequately.\n-23-\nTable of Contents\nCompetition in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans. This competition currently comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage\nbanking companies, credit unions and other lenders, including online “fintech” companies. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater\nfinancial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services\nor more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the\nnumber and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions,\nas well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater\nfinancial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations.\nThese competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to\nretain existing deposits or attract new deposits.\nWe have also been active in competing for New York and New Jersey governmental and municipal deposits. As of December 31, 2023, governmental\nand municipal deposits accounted for approximately $745.0 million in deposits. The governor of New Jersey has proposed that the state form and own a bank\nin which governmental and municipal entities would deposit their excess funds, with the state-owned bank then financing small businesses and municipal\nprojects in New Jersey. Although this proposal is in the very early stages, should this proposal be adopted and a state-owned bank formed, it could impede our\nability to attract and retain governmental and municipal deposits.\nIncreased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations, which may increase our cost of\nfunds.\nWe also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and\ngovernmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that\ngovern our operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services. This competition may\nreduce or limit our margins on banking services, reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nIn addition, the banking industry in general faces competition for deposit, credit and money management products from non-bank technology firms, or\nfintech companies, which may offer products independently or through relationships with insured depository institutions.\nExternal factors, many of which we cannot control, may result in liquidity concerns for us.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that the Bank may be unable to meet its obligations as they come due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or\npay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk\ntolerances.\nLiquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by\ndepositors, repayment of borrowings, operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividend payments to shareholders.\nLiquidity is derived primarily from deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; prepayment and maturities of loans;\nprincipal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations, and access\nto other funding sources. In addition, in recent periods we have substantially increased our use of alternate deposit origination channels, such as brokered\ndeposits, including reciprocal deposit services, and internet listing services.\n-24-\nTable of Contents\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial\nservices industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to\nmarket factors or an adverse regulatory action against us, as well as events affecting other market participants, such as failures of other insured depository\ninstitutions. In addition, our ability to use alternate deposit origination channels could be substantially impaired if we fail to remain “well capitalized”. Our\nability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and\nexpectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the\ncapital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage. Any decline in available funding could\nadversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any\nof which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDeclines in the value of our investment securities portfolio may adversely impact our results.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $617.2 million in fair value of investment securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale.\nWe may be required to record an allowance for credit on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value below their amortized cost basis that is\nconsidered credit related. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information on\ninvestment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a\nnegative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough, it could affect the ability of the Bank to upstream\ndividends to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and could also\nnegatively impact our regulatory capital ratios.\nThe Bank’s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations, which, to the extent that the Company requires such dividends in the future,\nmay affect the Company’s ability to honor its obligations and pay dividends.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations. We\ncurrently depend on the Bank’s cash and liquidity to pay our operating expenses and to fund dividends to shareholders. We cannot assure you that in the future\nthe Bank will have the capacity to pay the necessary dividends and that we will not require dividends from the Bank to satisfy our obligations. Various statutes\nand regulations limit the availability of dividends from the Bank. It is possible, depending upon our and the Bank’s financial condition and other factors, that\nbank regulators could assert that payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event that the Bank is unable to\npay dividends, we may not be able to service our obligations, as they become due, or pay dividends on our capital stock. Consequently, the inability to receive\ndividends from the Bank could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIn addition, as described under “Capital Adequacy Guidelines,” banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a capital conservation\nbuffer on top of minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5%. Banking institutions which do not maintain capital in excess of\nthe capital conservation buffer will face constraints on the payment of dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\nAccordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to the Company may be\nprohibited or limited.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock if we have not made required dividend payments on our outstanding, noncumulative\npreferred stock.\nWe have a series of outstanding perpetual preferred stock, our 5.25% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. The\nrights of the preferred stockholders to receive dividends are senior to the rights of our common holders, although the preferred dividend rights are non-\ncumulative. Therefore, unless all dividends due on our outstanding preferred stock have been declared and paid for the most recent dividend period provided\nfor under the terms of the preferred stock, we may not pay a dividend on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock during that period.\n-25-\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur impairment to goodwill.\nWe review our goodwill at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to\nour business, could indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments\nand assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a competitive environment and\nprojections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis results in an impairment to our\ngoodwill, we would be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined\nto exist. Any such charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions.\nSince January 1, 2019, we have acquired GHB, BoeFly and BNJ. To be successful as a larger institution, we must successfully integrate the operations\nand retain the clients of acquired institutions, attract and retain the management required to successfully manage larger operations, and control costs.\nFuture results of operations will depend in large part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired institutions and retain the\nclients of those institutions. If we are unable to successfully manage the integration of the separate cultures, client bases and operating systems of the acquired\ninstitutions, and any other institutions that may be acquired in the future, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, to successfully manage substantial growth, we may need to increase noninterest expenses through additional personnel, leasehold and data\nprocessing costs, among others. In order to successfully manage growth, we may need to adopt and effectively implement policies, procedures and controls to\nmaintain credit quality, control costs and oversee our operations. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in this strategy.\nWe may be challenged to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on management and operations that may result from growth. The\nability to manage growth will depend on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. Success will also depend on the ability of officers\nand key employees to continue to implement and improve operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent client relationships and to hire, train\nand manage employees.\nFinally, substantial growth may stress regulatory capital levels, and may require us to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that we will\nbe able to raise any required capital, or that we will be able to raise capital on terms that are beneficial to stockholders.\n-26-\nTable of Contents\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWe expect that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in\nacquiring other target companies if we pursue such acquisitions. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive.\nAlso, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an\nacquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators will consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance\nand levels of goodwill when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders’ equity per\nshare of our common stock.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather or health related events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have\nan adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nHurricanes and other weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which\nwe operate. In addition, these weather events may result in a decline in value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies,\nforeclosures and credit losses. Finally, health related events, such as a viral pandemic, could adversely affect the business of our clients and our local\neconomies, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.\nThe Company will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements when total assets exceed $10 billion.\nThe Company’s total assets were $9.856 billion as of December 31, 2023. Banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to requirements\nimposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, including: the examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assess\ncompliance with Federal consumer financial laws, imposition of higher FDIC premiums, and reduced debit card interchange fees, all of which increase\noperating costs and reduce earnings.\nAs the Company approaches $10 billion in total consolidated assets, additional costs have been incurred to prepare for the implementation of these\nimposed requirements. The Company may be required to invest more significant management attention and resources to evaluate and continue to make any\nchanges necessary to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, Federal financial regulators may require\naccelerated actions and investments to prepare for compliance before $10 billion in total consolidated assets is exceeded, and may suspend or delay certain\nregulatory actions, such as approving a proposed merger, if preparations are deemed inadequate. Upon reaching this threshold, the Company faces the risk of\nfailing to meet these requirements, which may negatively impact results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Applicable to the Banking Industry Generally:\nRecent events impacting the financial services industry.\nRecent events impacting the financial services industry, including the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, have\nesulted in increased volatility and reduced valuations of equity and other securities of banks in the capital markets. In addition, the Federal Reserve, in order to\ncombat inflation, has employed quantitative tightening in order to reduce the size of its balance sheet, resulting in increased competition and costs for bank\ndeposits and an increased risk of an economic recession. These recent events have, and could continue to, increase competition for deposits and adversely\nmpact the market price and volatility of the Company’s common stock.\nThese recent events may also result in potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and bank holding companies or result in the\nimpositions of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, including higher capital requirements, which could have a material impact on our\nbusiness. We may be impacted by concerns regarding the soundness or creditworthiness of other financial institutions, which can cause substantial disruption\nwithin the financial markets and increased expenses. The cost of resolving the recent bank failures has caused the FDIC to issue additional special assessments\nand could cause the FDIC to increase premiums or issue additional special assessments in the future.\n-27-\nTable of Contents\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for credit losses and to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. The process for\ndetermining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the\nfuture, as well as the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. If our judgment proves to be\nincorrect, our allowance may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio. Further, state and federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their\nexamination process, review our loans and allowance and may require an increase in our allowance for credit losses. Further increases to the allowance could\nadversely affect our earnings.\nChanges in interest rates, as well as other actions the Federal Reserve may take may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans,\ninvestments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. The level of net interest income is primarily a\nfunction of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such\nassets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities\nwhich, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the “FOMC”), and market interest rates.\nA sustained increase in market interest rates, such as has been in effect since the first half of 2023, could adversely affect our earnings if our cost of\nfunds increases more rapidly than our yield on our earning assets and compresses our net interest margin. In addition, the economic value of portfolio equity\nwould decline as interest rates increase.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. We expect that we will\nperiodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive\nto changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-\nearning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more\nquickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates,\nwhich are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international\nevents and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nWe also attempt to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate\nsensitive liabilities. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial performance.\nIn addition to increases in interest rates, the FOMC has also changed its stance on monetary policy as an additional effort to reduce inflation.\nBeginning in the second half of 2022, the FOMC began reducing its balance sheet, implementing a program of quantitative tightening to reduce the overall\nmoney supply. As a result, we may face greater competition for deposits, resulting in a higher cost of funds and a reduced net interest margin, as well as greater\nliquidity risk to continue to fund our loan originations. We are unable to predict the duration and ultimate impact of the FOMC’s quantitative tightening\nprogram. However, if the program significantly tightens the nation’s money supply, it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\n-28-\nTable of Contents\nThe banking business is subject to significant government regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation and control. These laws and regulations are subject to change and may require\nsubstantial modifications to our operations or may cause us to incur substantial additional compliance costs. In addition, future legislation and government\npolicy could adversely affect the commercial banking industry and our operations. Such governing laws can be anticipated to continue to be the subject of\nfuture modification. Our management cannot predict what effect any such future modifications will have on our operations. In addition, the primary focus of\nFederal and state banking regulation is the protection of depositors and not the shareholders of the regulated institutions.\nFor example, implementation of all required regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act may result in substantial new compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank\nAct was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Generally, the Dodd-Frank Act is effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to\nspecific sections of the law, many of which will not become effective until various Federal regulatory agencies have promulgated rules implementing the\nstatutory provisions. Ultimately, final implementation the Dodd-Frank Act could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a\nwhole, or on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThese provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may\nimpact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing,\nattract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These\nchanges also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and\ncould therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ultimate effect of certain of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.\n-29-\nTable of Contents\nThe laws that regulate our operations are designed for the protection of depositors and the public, not our shareholders.\nThe federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our operations give regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their\nsupervisory and enforcement responsibilities, and generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the\npurpose of protecting shareholders. These laws and regulations can materially affect our future business. Laws and regulations now affecting us may be\nchanged at any time, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations by bank regulatory authorities is also subject to change.\nWe can give no assurance that future changes in laws and regulations or changes in their interpretation will not adversely affect our business.\nLegislative and regulatory changes may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for non-bank\ncompetitors.\nWe cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business; increased use of technology may expose us to service interruptions or breaches\nin security.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in:\n● Telecommunications;\n● Data processing;\n● Automation;\n● Internet-based banking, including personal computers, mobile phones and tablets;\n● Debit cards and so-called “smart cards”;\n● Remote deposit capture;\n● Artificial Intelligence;\n● Cryptocurrency; and\n● Use of Blockchain.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the future will depend, to a certain extent, on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes.\nWe offer electronic banking services for our consumer and business clients via our website, www.cnob.com, including Internet banking and electronic bill\npayment, as well as mobile banking by phone. We also offer check cards, ATM cards, credit cards, and automatic and ACH transfers. The successful operation\nand further development of these and other new technologies will likely require additional capital investments in the future. In addition, increased use of\nelectronic banking creates opportunities for interruptions in service or security breaches, which could expose us to claims by clients or other third parties and\ndamage our reputation. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in\nthe future, or that we will be able to maintain a secure electronic environment.\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe purpose of this analysis is to provide the reader with information relevant to understanding and assessing the Company’s results of operations for\neach of the past three years and financial condition for each of the past two years. In order to fully appreciate this analysis, the reader is encouraged to review\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing under Item 8 of this report, and statistical data presented in this document.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nSee Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding forward-looking statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company considers the allowance for credit losses\nand related provision to be critical to our financial results. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1a in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Related Provision\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of current expected credit losses considering available information relevant to assessing collectability of\ncash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet\ndate. The methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of\njudgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes\nto the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of\nCondition.\nManagement believes the following information may enable investors to better understand the changes in our allowance for credit losses for loans. The\nCompany’s allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") for loans totaled $82.0 million and $90.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $8.5\nmillion decrease in the allowance for credit losses for loans was primarily driven by net charge-offs of $17.0 million, partially offset by $8.4 million in provision\nor credit losses.\nThe quantitative component of our ACL for loans on collectively evaluated loans, which is largely based on a selection of various economic forecasts,\nncreased by $3.4 million as of December 31, 2023 when compared to December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of $0.3\nbillion in collectively evaluated loans. The qualitative component of our ACL for loans, which is largely based on management’s judgment of qualitative loss\nfactors, was relatively unchanged, on an absolute basis, over the same period-of-time, as qualitative factor trends slightly improved over 2023, or largely\nemained unchanged.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated loans totaled $80.6 million as of December 31, 2023, which included $71.6\nmillion of allowance related to commercial and commercial real estate loans. Of the $71.6 million allowance related to commercial and commercial real estate\noans, $24.1 million was attributable to qualitative loss factors. Changes in managements’ judgement of qualitative loss factors could result in a significant\nhange to the allowance for credit losses for loans. As described in Note 1a to our financial statements filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nqualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the most severe loss periods\ndentified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. As of December 31, 2023, on a weighted average basis the most\nevere historical loss rate for our commercial and commercial real estate loans were 2.33% and 1.88%, respectively.\n-37-\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s quantitative component of allowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated loans is calculated with an economic forecast sourced\nfrom Moody’s. Management performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in the economic forecast as a key input on our\nallowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated loans. Within the various economic scenarios considered for this hypothetical sensitivity analysis, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the quantitative estimate of the allowance for credit loss for collectively evaluated loans would increase by approximately $39.4 million\nunder sole consideration of an adverse Moody’s economic forecast. The hypothetical sensitivity calculation reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance\nestimate to macroeconomic forecast data but lacks other qualitative overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process.\nAs such, this does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for reasons including increases or decreases in qualitative\nadjustments, changes in the risk profile and size of the portfolio, changes in the severity of the macroeconomic scenario and the range of scenarios under\nmanagement consideration.\nOur allowance for credit losses for individually analyzed loans is determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows\ndiscounted using the loan’s effective interest rate or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. As\nof December 31, 2023, the Company’s allowance for credit losses on individually analyzed loans decreased $9.4 million from December 31, 2022. This\ndecrease was primarily due to reductions in individually analyzed loans, increases in charge-offs, and increases in the fair value of collateral for collateral-\ndependent loans, partially offset by increases to the allowance on existing individually analyzed loans.\nOverview and Strategy\nWe serve as a holding company for the Bank, which is our primary asset and only operating subsidiary. We follow a business plan that emphasizes the\ndelivery of customized banking services in our market area to clients who desire a high level of personalized service and responsiveness. The Bank conducts a\ntraditional banking business, making commercial loans, consumer loans and residential and commercial real estate loans. In addition, the Bank offers various\nnon-deposit products through non-proprietary relationships with third party vendors. The Bank relies upon deposits as the primary funding source for its assets.\nThe Bank offers traditional deposit products.\nMany of our clients relationships start with referrals from existing clients. We then seek to cross sell our products to clients to grow the client\nrelationship. For example, we will frequently offer an interest rate concession on credit products for clients that maintain a noninterest-bearing deposit account\nat the Bank. This strategy has helped maintain our funding costs and the growth of our interest expense even as we have substantially increased our total\ndeposits. It has also helped fuel our significant loan growth. We believe that the Bank’s continued growth and profitability demonstrate the need for and success\nof our brand of banking.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning\nassets and the interest paid on funds borrowed to support those assets, primarily deposits. Net interest margin is the difference between the weighted average\nrate received on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid to fund those interest-earning assets, which is also affected by the average level of\ninterest-earning assets as compared with that of interest-bearing liabilities. Net income is also affected by the amount of noninterest income and noninterest\nexpenses.\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis present the more significant factors affecting the Company’s financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022 and results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report.\n-38-\nTable of Contents\nOperating Results Overview\nNet income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $81.0 million, a decrease of $38.2 million, or 32.1%, compared to net\nincome of $119.2 million for 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $2.07 for 2023, a 31.2% decrease from $3.01 for 2022.\nThe change in net income from 2022 to 2023 was attributable to the following:\nDecrease in net interest income of $47.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to an 87 basis-point contraction in the net interest margin to 2.82% from 3.69%,\n●\npartially offset by a $0.9 billion, or 11.0%, increase in average interest-earning assets.\n● Increase in noninterest expenses of $17.6 million, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $7.0 million attributable to increased staff in\nboth the revenue and back-office areas of the Bank, base salary increases and incentive compensation accruals. Additionally, there were increases in FDIC\ninsurance of $5.5 million, which included a $2.1 million FDIC special assessment recognized in 2023. Excluding the $2.1 million special assessment, the increase\nin FDIC insurance from the prior year of $3.4 million was attributable to balance sheet growth and a two-basis point increase in the Bank’s initial base\nrate. Finally, there were increases in information technology and communications of $3.2 million, other expenses of $2.3 million, occupancy and equipment of\n$1.0 million and marketing and advertising of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in professional and consulting of $0.5 million, BoeFly acquisition of $0.5\nmillion and amortization of core deposit intangibles of $0.2 million. The increase in information technology and communications was primarily attributable to\nadditional investments in technology, equipment and software.\n● Decrease in provision for credit losses of $9.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions.\n● Increase in noninterest income of $0.7 million, primarily due to decreases in net losses on equity securities of $1.4 million and income on bank owned life\ninsurance of $0.7 million, partially offset by decreases in deposit, loan and other income of $1.4 million.\n● Decrease in income tax expense of $16.1 million resulting primarily from lower taxable income.\nNet income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $119.2 million, a decrease of $9.5 million, or 7.4%, compared to net income\nof $128.6 million for 2021. Diluted earnings per share were $3.01 for 2022, a 6.5% decrease from $3.22 for 2021.\nThe change in net income from 2021 to 2022 was primarily attributable to the following:\nIncrease in net interest income of $39.2 million. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in average interest-earning assets, which grew by\n●\n14.3% to $8.3 billion and a widening of 3 basis-points in the net interest margin.\nIncrease in provision for credit losses of $23.3 million. The increase was primarily due to organic loan growth, as well as changes in forecasted\n●\nmacroeconomic conditions\n● Increase in noninterest expenses of $17.4 million, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $16.9 million attributable to increased staff in\nboth the revenue and back-office areas of the Bank, base salary increases and incentive compensation accruals. Additionally, there were increases in acquisition\nexpenses related to BoeFly of $1.5 million, other expenses of $1.1 million, marketing and advertising of $0.4 million, and FDIC insurance of $0.2\nmillion, partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment of $1.8 million, amortization of core deposit intangibles of $0.3 million, professional and\nconsulting of $0.2 million and information technology and communication of $0.2 million.\n● Decrease in noninterest income of $2.4 million, primarily due to decreases in net gains on loans-held-for-sale of $2.1 million, gains on sales of branches of $0.7\nmillion in 2021, decreases in net gains on sale/redemption of investment securities of $0.2 million and an increase in net losses on equity securities of $1.1\nmillion, partially offset by increases in deposit, loan and other income of $0.9 million and income on bank owned life insurance of $0.8 million.\n● Increase in income tax expense of $1.3 million resulting primarily from higher state tax rates and a slightly higher percentage of income being derived from\ntaxable sources.\n● Increase in preferred dividends of $4.3 million.\n-39-\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Income\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2023 totaled $258.3 million, a decrease of $46.3 million, or 15.2%, from 2022. The decrease in net\ninterest income was due to an 87 basis-point contraction in the net interest margin to 2.82% from 3.69%, partially offset by a $0.9 billion, or 11.0%, increase in\naverage interest-earning assets. The net interest margin contraction was due to a 199-basis point increase in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-\nbearing demand, to 2.74%, and was partially offset by a 77 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield to 5.57%. Average total loans, which includes loans\nheld-for-sale, increased by 10.8% to $8.2 billion in 2023 from $7.4 billion in 2022. The increase in average total loans is attributable to higher loan originations.\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2022 totaled $304.6 million, an increase of $39.9 million, or 15.1%, from 2022. The increase in net\ninterest income was due to an increase in average interest-earning assets, which grew by 14.3% to $8.3 billion and a widening of 3 basis-points in the net\ninterest margin. The widening of the net interest margin was mainly attributable to higher yields on loans and securities and lower average cash balances, offset\nby a higher cost of funds. Average total loans, which includes loans held-for-sale, increased by 15.0% to $7.4 billion in 2022 from $6.4 billion in 2021.

Provision expense may therefore become more volatile due to changes in CECL model\nassumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the provision for credit losses was $8.2 million, a decrease of $9.6 million, compared to the provision for\ncredit losses of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected\nchanges in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, partially offset by organic loan growth.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for (reversal of) credit losses were $17.8 million, an increase of $23.3 million, compared to the\nprovision for (reversal of) credit losses of ($5.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 reflected strong organic loan growth and changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions.\n-42-\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the full-year 2023 increased by $0.7 million, or 5.7%, to $14.0 million from $13.2 million in 2022. The increase was primarily\ndue to decreases in net losses on equity securities of $1.4 million and increases in income on bank owned life insurance of $0.7 million, partially offset by\ndecreases in deposit, loan and other income of $1.4 million.\nNoninterest income for the full-year 2022 decreased by $2.4 million, or 15.6%, to $13.2 million from $15.7 million in 2021. The decrease was\nprimarily due to decreases in net gains on loans held for sale of $2.1 million, gains on sale of branches of $0.7 million, net gains on sale/redemption of\ninvestment securities of $0.2 million and an increase in net losses on equity securities of $1.1 million, partially offset by increases in deposit, loan and other\nincome of $0.9 million and income on bank owned life insurance of $0.8 million.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses for the full-year 2023 increased by $17.6 million, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $7.0 million\nattributable to increased staff in both the revenue and back-office areas of the Bank, base salary increases and incentive compensation accruals. Additionally,\nthere were increases in FDIC insurance of $5.5 million, which included a $2.1 million FDIC special assessment recognized in 2023. Excluding the $2.1 million\nspecial assessment, the increase in FDIC insurance from the prior year of $3.4 million was attributable to balance sheet growth and a two-basis point increase in\nthe Bank’s initial base rate. Finally, there were increases in information technology and communications of $3.2 million, other expenses of $2.3 million,\noccupancy and equipment of $1.0 million and marketing and advertising of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in professional and consulting of $0.5\nmillion, BoeFly acquisition of $0.5 million and amortization of core deposit intangibles of $0.2 million. The increase in information technology and\ncommunications was primarily attributable to additional investments in technology, equipment and software.\nNoninterest expenses for the full-year 2022 increased by $17.4 million, or 15.9%, to $126.4 million from $109.0 million in 2021. The increase was\nprimarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $16.9 million, change in value of acquisition price of $1.5 million , other expenses of $1.1\nmillion, marketing and advertising of $0.4 million and FDIC insurance of $0.2 million, partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment of $1.8\nmillion, amortization of core deposit intangible of $0.3 million, information technology and communication of $0.2 million, professional and consulting of $0.2\nmillion and other components of net periodic pension income of $0.3 million. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was attributable to increased staff\nin both revenue and back-office areas of the Bank, base salary increases, and incentive compensation accruals.\n-43-\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $30.0 million for 2023 compared to $46.0 million for 2022 and $44.7 million for 2021. The decrease in income tax expense\nin 2023 when compared to 2022 was primarily the result of lower taxable income. The increase in income tax expense in 2022 when compared to 2021 was\nalso primarily the result of higher taxable income. The effective tax rates were 25.6% in 2023, 26.9% in 2022 and 25.5% for 2021. The lower effective tax rate\nduring 2023 when compared to 2022, was the result of a lower percentage of income being derived from taxable sources. The higher effective tax rate during\n2022 when compared to 2021 was the result of a higher percentage of income being derived from taxable sources.\nFor a more detailed description of income taxes see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition Overview\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s total assets were $9.856 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion from December 31, 2022.

One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality. When a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment, we attempt to\ncure the deficiency by sending late notices, as well as making personal contact with the borrower. Typically, late notices are sent approximately 10 days after\nthe date the payment is due, followed up by direct contact with the borrower approximately 15 days after payment is due. In most cases, deficiencies are\npromptly resolved. If the delinquency continues, late charges are assessed, and additional efforts are made to collect the deficiency. Total loans delinquent 30\ndays or more are reported to the board of directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.\nOn loans where the collection of principal or interest payments is doubtful, the accrual of interest income ceases (“nonaccrual” loans). Except for\nloans that are well-secured and in the process of collection, it is our policy to discontinue accruing additional interest and reverse any interest accrued on any\nloan that is 90 days or greater past due. On occasion, this action may be taken earlier if the financial condition of the borrower raises significant concern with\nregard to the borrower’s ability to service the debt in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Interest income is not accrued on these loans until the\nborrower’s financial condition and payment record demonstrate an ability to service the debt. Typically, a nonaccrual loan may return to accrual status if the\nborrower makes the loan current, and then makes six consecutive payments as scheduled.\nReal estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned (“OREO”) until sold. OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or\nfair value less estimated selling costs. Costs associated with acquiring and improving a foreclosed property are usually capitalized to the extent that the carrying\nvalue does not exceed fair value less estimated selling costs. Holding costs are charged to expense. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are charged to\noperations, as incurred.\nThe Company evaluates individual instruments for expected credit losses when those instruments do not share similar risk characteristics with\nnstruments evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. The Company evaluates the pooling methodology at least annually. Loans transition from defined\negments for individual analysis when credit characteristics, or risk traits, change in a material manner. A loan is considered for individual analysis when, based\non current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according\no the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by the Company in determining individual analysis include payment status and the probability\nof collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Nonaccrual loans that are $250,000 or higher and all purchased credit-deteriorated (PCD)\noans are individually analyzed. For loans designated as nonaccrual with balances of less than $250,000, these loans are collectively evaluated, and, accordingly,\nare not separately identified for analysis or disclosures.

Individual analysis will\nestablish a specific reserve for instruments in scope.\n-49-\nTable of Contents\nAsset Classification. Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting\nproblem and potential problem assets. We have incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with Federal banking regulations,\nas a part of our credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as\n“substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of\nthe obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will\nsustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard”\nwith the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,\n“highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets\nwithout the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant\nclassification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated “special mention.”\nWhen an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as “substandard” or “doubtful,” it is required that a general valuation\nallowance for credit losses must be established in an amount deemed prudent by management. General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which\nhave been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to\nparticular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific\nallowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.\nA bank’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by Federal bank regulators\nwhich can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. The Federal banking agencies have adopted an interagency policy\nstatement on the allowance for credit losses. The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for\nthe assessment and establishment of allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation\nguidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality\nproblems; that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that management establish\nacceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. Our management believes that, based on information\ncurrently available, our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level which covers all known and probable incurred losses in the portfolio at each\nreporting date. However, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for credit losses may become\nnecessary.\nThe table below sets forth information on our classified loans and loans designated as special mention (excluding loans held-for-sale) as of the dates\npresented:\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nClassified Loans:\nSubstandard $ 58,509 $ 120,330\nDoubtful - -\nLoss - -\nTotal classified loans 58,509 120,330\nSpecial Mention Loans 54,168 62,105\nTotal classified and special mention loans $ 112,677 $ 182,435\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, “substandard” loans and “doubtful” loans, which include lower credit quality loans which possess higher\nrisk characteristics than “special mention” loans, decreased to $58.5 million, or 0.7% of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023 from $120.3 million, or\n1.5% of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in substandard loans from the prior year was primarily attributable to loan payoffs resulting\nfrom successful loan workouts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, “special mention” loans were $54.2 million, or 0.6% of loans receivable, while “special mention” loans as\nof December 31, 2022 were $62.1 million, or 0.8% of loans receivable.\n-50-\nTable of Contents\nNonaccrual Loans, OREO and Loans 90 Days or Greater Past Due and Still Accruing\nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and OREO. Nonaccrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been suspended. OREO\nrepresents property acquired through foreclosure in partial or full satisfaction of loans. Loans 90 days or greater past due and still accruing represent loans that\nare both well-secured and in the process of collection, as well as any purchased credit-deteriorated loans, net of fair value marks, which accrete income per the\nvaluation at date of acquisition. The Company considers charging off loans, or a portion thereof, at the time the Company deems it has exhausted all means of\ncollection. For additional information regarding loans, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table sets forth, as of the dates indicated, the amount of the Company’s nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (“OREO”), and loans\npast due 90 days or greater and still accruing:\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNonaccrual loans $ 52,524 $ 44,454 $ 61,700\nOREO - 264 -\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 52,524 $ 44,718 $ 61,700\nLoans 90 days or greater past due and still accruing (PCD) $ - $ 5,591 $ 13,531\nNonaccrual loans to loans receivable 0.63% 0.55% 0.90%\nNonperforming assets to total assets 0.53 0.46 0.76\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Related Provision\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of current expected credit losses considering available information relevant to assessing collectability of\ncash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet\ndate. The measurement of expected credit losses is applicable to loans receivable and investment securities measured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of credit. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses when the\nBank believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. The allowance is\nestablished through a provision for credit losses that is charged against income. The methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses is considered\na critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for\nchanges in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses. The expected credit loss\nfor unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition in “Other Liabilities”.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses for loans was $82.0 million, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 9.4%, from $90.5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by net charge-offs of $17.0 million, partially offset by $8.4 million in\nprovision for credit losses.\n-51-\nTable of Contents\nThe allowance for credit losses for loans as a percentage of loans receivable was 0.98% as of December 31, 2023 and 1.12% as of December 31, 2022.\nThree-Year Statistical Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans\nThe following table reflects the relationship of loan volume, the provision and allowance for credit losses for loans and net charge-offs for the periods\npresented.\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance as of January 1, $ 90,513 $ 78,773 $ 79,226\nCECL Day 1 Adjustment - - 6,557\nBalance as of January 1, as adjusted for changes in accounting principal 90,513 78,773 85,783\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial 14,888 2,612 382\nCommercial real estate 2,142 2,819 1,780\nResidential real estate 18 9 235\nConsumer 1 3 -\nTotal charge-offs 17,049 5,443 2,397\nRecoveries:\nCommercial 10 54 289\nCommercial real estate - - 85\nResidential real estate 68 63 20\nConsumer 8 - 11\nTotal recoveries 86 117 405\nNet charge-offs 16,963 5,326 1,992\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses for loans 8,424 17,066 (5,018)\nBalance at end of year $ 81,974 $ 90,513 $ 78,773\nRatio of net charge-offs during the year to average loans receivable outstanding during\nthe year 0.23% 0.07% 0.03%\nAllowance for credit losses for loans as a percentage of loans receivable 0.98 1.12 1.15\nFor additional information regarding loans, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImplicit in the lending function is the fact that credit losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with the type of loan being made, the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower and prevailing economic conditions. The allowance for credit losses has been allocated in the table below according to the\nestimated amount deemed to be reasonably and supportably necessary to provide for the possibility of either lifetime expected losses or losses being incurred\nwithin the following categories of loans as of December 31, for each of the past three years.\nThe following table shows the amounts of the allowance allocable to such loans and the percentage of such loans to gross loans, along with the amount\nof the unallocated allowance. “Total Commercial”, as shown below, includes commercial, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans.\nTotal Commercial Residential Real Estate Consumer\nAmount of % of Total Amount of % of Total Amount of % of Total Total\nAllowance Allowance Allowance Allowance Allowance Allowance Allowance\n(dollars in thousands)\n2023 $ 77,649 94.7% $ 4,320 5.2% $ 5 0.1% $ 81,974\n2022 86,363 95.4% 4,143 4.6% 7 0.1% 90,513\n2021 75,138 95.4% 3,628 4.6% 7 0.1% 78,773\n-52-\nTable of Contents\nInvestments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of investment securities, including equity securities, increased by $65.7 million to\napproximately $726.5 million or 7.9% of average earning assets, from $660.8 million, or 8.0% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31,\n2022. As of December 31, 2023, the principal components of the investment portfolio are U.S. Treasury and Government Agency Obligations, Federal Agency\nObligations including mortgage-backed securities, Obligations of U.S. States and Political Subdivisions, Corporate Bonds and other debt and equity securities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, rate related factors increased investment revenue by $2.9 million and volume related factors increased\ninvestment revenue by $2.0 million. The tax-equivalent yield on investments increased by 43 basis points to 3.10% from a yield of 2.67% during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nSecurities available-for-sale are a part of the Company’s interest rate risk management strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest\nrates, changes in prepayment risk, liquidity management and other factors. The Company continues to reposition the investment portfolio as part of an overall\ncorporate-wide strategy to produce reasonable and consistent margins where feasible, while attempting to limit risks inherent in the Company’s Consolidated\nStatement of Condition.\nAs of December 31, 2023, net unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, which are carried as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nloss and included in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, amounted to $57.8 million as compared with net unrealized losses of $61.8 million as of December 31,\n2022. The decrease in unrealized losses is predominately attributable to changes in market conditions and interest rates. Unrealized losses have not been\nrecognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell, and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities\nprior to their anticipated recovery. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been\nrecorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. For additional information regarding the\nCompany’s investment portfolio, see Note 3, Note 15 and Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no sales from the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio. The Company had a $195 thousand gain on the\nredemption of available-for-sale securities during 2021. The Company had no impairment charges in 2023, 2022 and 2021.

We seek to reduce the vulnerability of our operations to changes in\ninterest rates, and actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the Bank’s Asset Liability Committee (the “ALCO”). The ALCO generally reviews our\nliquidity, cash flow needs, maturities of investments, deposits and borrowings, and current market conditions and interest rates.\nThe Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk including, but not limited to: (i) balancing the types and structures of interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by diversifying mix, coupons, maturities and/or repricing characteristics, (ii) reducing the overall interest rate\nsensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and/or longer-term deposits; utilizing FHLB advances and wholesale deposits for our interest rate risk profile, (iii)\nmanaging the investment portfolio for liquidity and interest rate risk profile, and (iv) entering into interest rate swap and cap agreements.\nWe currently utilize net interest income simulation and economic value of equity (“EVE”) models to measure the potential impact to the Bank of\nfuture changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the results of the models are monitored by guidelines prescribed by our\nBoard of Directors. If model results were to fall outside prescribed ranges, action, including additional monitoring and reporting to the Board, would be\nrequired by the ALCO and Bank’s management.\n-55-\nTable of Contents\nThe net interest income simulation model attempts to measure the change in net interest income over the next one-year period, and over the next three-\nyear period on a cumulative basis, assuming certain changes in the general level of interest rates. The year over year change in the interest rate risk profile\nprimarily reflects updated model assumptions in response to dynamically changing market conditions, including higher beta assumptions, as well as a\npositioning of the balance sheet to be more liability sensitive.\nBased on our model, which was run as of December 31, 2023, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous increase\nin the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 9.25%, while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would\nincrease net interest income by 5.34%. As of December 31, 2022, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous increase in\nthe general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 2.22%, while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in interest rates would\ndecrease net interest income by 2.01%.\nBased on our model, which was run as of December 31, 2023, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200 basis-point\nnstantaneous increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 5.68%, while a 100 basis-point instantaneous decrease in\nnterest rates would increase net interest income by 4.29%. As of December 31, 2022, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200\nasis-point instantaneous increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 2.66%, while a 100 basis-point instantaneous\ndecrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 3.99%.\nAn EVE analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows with instantaneous rate shocks of up 200 basis\npoints and down 100 basis points. The economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change. Our EVE as of December 31, 2023, would\ndecrease by 15.09% with an instantaneous rate shock of up 200 basis points, and increase by 5.75% with an instantaneous rate shock of down 100 basis\npoints. Our EVE as of December 31, 2022, would decrease by 10.51% with an instantaneous rate shock of up 200 basis points, and decrease by 1.13% with an\nnstantaneous rate shock of down 100 basis points.\nThe change in interest rate sensitivity was impacted by changes in overall market interest rates, updates to certain model assumptions, changes in short\nand intermediate-term fixed rate funding and by the deposit mix shift into certificates of deposit, from both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing non-\nmaturity deposits.\n-56-\nTable of Contents\nThe following table illustrates the most recent results for EVE and NII as of December 31, 2023.\nInterest Rates Estimated Estimated Change in EVE Interest Rates Estimated Estimated Change in NII\n(basis points) EVE Amount % (basis points) NII Amount %\n+300 $ 791,117 $ (236,456) (23.01) +300 $ 216,207 $ (36,087) (14.30)\n+200 872,546 (155,027) (15.09) +200 228,949 (23,345) (9.25)\n+100 958,053 (69,520) (6.77) +100 241,865 (10,429) (4.13)\n0 1,027,573 - - 0 252,294 - -\n-100 1,086,643 59,070 5.75 -100 265,773 13,479 5.34\n-200 1,112,376 84,803 8.25 -200 270,782 18,488 7.33\n-300 1,137,176 109,603 10.67 -300 276,718 24,424 9.68\nCertain model limitations are inherent in the methodology used in the EVE and net interest income measurements. The models require the making of\ncertain assumptions which may tend to oversimplify the way actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The models assume that the\ncomposition of the Company’s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured, thus\nthey do not consider the Company’s strategic plans, or any other steps it may take to respond to changes in rates over the forecasted period of time.\nAdditionally, the models assume immediate changes in interest rates, based on yield curves as of a point-in-time, which are reflected in a parallel, instantaneous\nand uniform manner across all yield curves, when in reality changes may rarely be of this nature. The models also utilize data derived from historical\nperformance and as interest rates change the actual performance of loan prepayments, rate sensitivities, and average life assumptions may deviate from\nassumptions utilized in the models and can impact the results. Accordingly, although the above measurements provide an indication of the Company’s interest\nrate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates.\nGiven the unique nature of the post-pandemic interest rate environment, and the speed with which interest rates have been changing, the projections noted\nabove on the Company’s EVE and net interest income and can be expected to differ from actual results.\nEstimates of Fair Value\nThe estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets of the Company, including available-for-sale investment securities. These are all recorded at\neither fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors. Circumstances that could cause\nestimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds, expected cash flows, credit quality, discount rates,\nor market interest rates. Fair values for most available-for-sale investment securities are based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not\navailable, fair values are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic condition risk characteristics of various financial\ninstruments, and other factors. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nThese estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.\nChanges in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.\n-57-\nTable of Contents\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative\npurchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the operations; unlike most industrial\ncompanies, nearly all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of\ngeneral levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of a bank’s ability to fund loans, withdrawals or maturities of deposits, and other cash outflows in a cost-effective manner. Our\nprincipal sources of funds are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities of investment securities, and funds provided by\noperations. While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly\ninfluenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that, on a short and long-term basis,\ncontractual liabilities, depositors’ withdrawal requirements, and other operational and client credit needs could be satisfied. As of December 31, 2023, liquid\nassets (cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and unencumbered investment securities) were $516.3 million, which represented 5.2% of\ntotal assets and 6.1% of total deposits and borrowings, compared to $760.0 million as of December 31, 2022, which represented 7.9% of total assets and\n9.3% of total deposits and borrowings on such date. As of December 31, 2023, not included in the above liquid assets were securities with a market value of\n$276.0 million which were pledged to either the Federal Reserve Bank’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”), or the Federal Home Loan Bank, which\nsupport aggregate unutilized borrowing capacity of $300.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\n-58-\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and, based on available qualified collateral as of December 31, 2023, had the\nability to borrow $2.8 billion. The Bank also has two credit facilities established with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for direct discount window\nborrowings and BTFP capacity based on pledged collateral and had the ability to borrow $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. The BTFP is scheduled to cease\nmaking new loans on March 11, 2024. At such time the unencumbered securities pledged to the BTFP can be released as unpledged collateral or pledged to\nother borrowing facilities for unutilized borrowing capacity. Currently the Bank has no outstanding BTFP borrowings. In addition, as of December 31, 2023,\nthe Bank had in place borrowing capacity of $335 million through correspondent banks and other unsecured borrowing lines. As of December 31, 2023, the\nBank had aggregate available and unused credit of approximately $3.3 billion, which represents the aforementioned facilities totaling $4.8 billion net of\n$1.5 billion in outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, outstanding commitments for the Bank to extend credit were\napproximately $1.2 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $242.7 million as of December 31, 2023, decreasing by $25.6 million from $268.3 million as of December 31,\n2022. Operating activities provided $92.9 million in net cash. Investing activities used $248.0 million in net cash, primarily reflecting an increase in loans.\nFinancing activities provided $129.6 million in net cash, primarily reflecting a net increase in deposits of $179.9 million and an increase in net borrowings of\n$75.9 million, partially offset by a repayment of subordinated debt of $75.0 million.\n-59-\nTable of Contents\nDeposits\nDeposits are our primary source of funds. Average total deposits increased by $765 million, or 11.3%, to $7.5 billion in 2023 from $6.8 billion in 2022\nand increased $558 million, or 9.0%, to $6.8 billion in 2022 from $6.2 billion in 2021. The increase in total average deposits in 2023 was primarily attributed to\naverage time deposits of $1.1 billion, partially offset by decreases in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $279 million and savings deposits of $44\nmillion.\nThe increase in average time deposits of $1.1 billion during 2023 was primarily attributed to increases of $570 million in nonreciprocal brokered time\ndeposits, $406 million in retail time deposits and $96 million in CDARs. The Bank has increased its utilization of nonreciprocal brokered time deposits during\n2023 primarily to enhance balance sheet liquidity and because it served as a favorable alternative to other borrowings.\nThe decrease in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits was consistent with industry trends reflecting higher levels of interest rates which\nresulted in migration of noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing demand deposits.\nICS reciprocal deposits are offered through the Bank’s participation in the IntraFi Network LLC network, formerly known as Promontory\nInterfinancial Network. Clients, who are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance sensitive, are able to place large dollar deposits with the\nCompany and the Company utilizes ICS and CDARS, under which the Bank receives a reciprocal deposit back in return to place those funds into non-maturity\naccounts, or certificates of deposit, issued by other banks in the IntraFi Network. This occurs in increments of less than the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage in amounts larger than the insured dollar\namount.\nTotal year-to-date average demand deposits as of December 31, 2023 included $943 million in ICS reciprocal deposits, compared to $301 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Total year-to-date average time deposits as of December 31, 2023 included $111 million in CDARS, compared to $15 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The increases in ICS reciprocal deposits and CDARS resulted primarily from changes in customer and market sentiment related to the\nfailure of three regional banks in March 2023 and the resulting migration of client deposits to the IntraFi Network in an effort to increase the level of FDIC\ndeposit insurance for clients.\nThe beta, which is the measurement of deposit rate sensitivity in response to market rate changes, on nonreciprocal brokered deposits tends to be\nhigher than that of ICS and CDARS reciprocal deposits, as nonreciprocal brokered time deposits are more directly correlated to prevailing market rates of\ninterest, while ICS and CDARs reciprocal deposits reflect the Bank’s relationship with reciprocal deposit clients and are more driven by a desire for FDIC\ninsurance coverage than market leading rates.\n-60-\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the year-to-date average balances and weighted average rates of our deposits for the periods indicated.\nYear-to-Date Average December Year-to-Date Average December Year-to-Date Average December\n31, 2023 31, 2022 31, 2021\nBalance Rate Balance Rate Balance Rate\n(dollars in thousands)\nDemand, noninterest-bearing $ 1,332,809 - $ 1,612,040 - $ 1,454,148 -\nDemand, interest-bearing & NOW 3,292,907 3.17% 3,284,866 0.80% 3,081,899 0.29%\nSavings 374,189 2.37 417,907 0.70 369,866 0.31\nTime 2,529,892 3.67 1,449,826 1.47 1,300,270 1.14\nAverage Total Deposits $ 7,529,797 2.74% $ 6,764,639 0.75% $ 6,206,183 0.52%\nThe following table sets forth information related to the uninsured deposit balances of the Bank.\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance Balance\n(dollars in thousands)\nAs stated in FFIEC 041-Consolidated Report of Condition, schedule RC-O:\nTotal Bank unconsolidated deposits (including affiliate and subsidiary accounts) $ 11,243,254 $ 10,670,491\nEstimated uninsured deposits 6,152,454 6,533,537\nThe Bank, on a consolidated basis:\nTotal deposits $ 7,536,202 $ 7,356,622\nEstimated uninsured deposits (excluding affiliate and subsidiary accounts) 2,388,545 3,148,407\n-61-\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of total actual deposit accounts, by account types for the periods indicated.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmount % of total Amount % of total\n(dollars in thousands)\nDemand, noninterest-bearing $ 1,259,364 16.7% $ 1,501,614 20.4%\nDemand, interest-bearing & NOW 3,326,989 44.1 3,085,613 41.9\nSavings 418,478 5.6 375,205 5.1\nTime 2,531,371 33.6 2,394,190 32.6\nTotal Deposits $ 7,536,202 100.0% $ 7,356,622 100.0%\nTotal deposits increased by $180 million, or 2.4%, to $7.5 billion in 2023 from $7.4 billion in 2022.

Accordingly, capital plans, stock repurchases, and\ndividend policies are monitored on an ongoing basis. The most important objective of the capital planning process is to balance effectively the retention of\ncapital to support future growth and the goal of providing stockholders with an attractive long-term return on their investment.\nThe Company’s Tier 1 leverage capital (defined as tangible stockholders’ equity for common stock and Trust Preferred Capital Securities) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 amounted to $1.0 billion or 10.8% of average total assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s Tier 1 leverage capital amounted to\n$1.0 billion or 10.7% of average total assets. The increase in Tier 1 capital reflects the Company’s retained earnings during 2023.\nUnited States bank regulators have issued guidelines establishing minimum capital standards related to the level of assets and off balance-sheet\nexposures adjusted for credit risk. Specifically, these guidelines categorize assets and off balance-sheet items into risk-weightings and require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s CET 1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital\nratios were 10.62%, 11.95% and 13.77%, respectively. For information on risk-based capital and regulatory guidelines for the Parent Corporation and its bank\nsubsidiary, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated\nunder regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the bank regulators regarding capital\ncomponents, risk weightings, and other factors.\n-64-\nTable of Contents\nSubordinated Debentures\nDuring 2003, the Company formed a statutory business trust, which exists for the exclusive purpose of (i) issuing Trust Securities representing\nundivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest\ndebentures (subordinated debentures) of the Company; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. On December 19, 2003, Center\nBancorp Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Corporation issued $5.0 million of MMCapS capital securities\nto investors due on January 23, 2034. The capital securities presently qualify as Tier I capital. The trust loaned the proceeds of this offering to the Company and\nreceived in exchange $5.2 million of the Parent Corporation’s subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to\nmaturity. The floating interest rate on the subordinate debentures was previously three-month LIBOR plus 2.85% and reprices quarterly. Upon the cessation of\npublication of LIBOR rates and pursuant to the Federal LIBOR Act and Federal Reserve regulations implementing the Act, applicable US Dollar LIBOR\nindexed instruments like the Company’s outstanding $5.0 million of MMCapS capital securities converted effective June 30, 2023 to a new index based on\nCME Term SOFR, as defined in the LIBOR Act, plus a tenor spread adjustment, which is referred to as the Benchmark Replacement. Therefore, effective for\nquarterly interest rate resets after July 3, 2023 the subordinated debentures’ floating rate will be three-month CME Term SOFR plus 2.85% plus a tenor spread\nadjust of 0.26161%. The rate as of December 31, 2023 was 8.50%. These subordinated debentures and the related income effects are not eliminated in the\nconsolidated financial statements, as the statutory business trust is not consolidated in accordance with FASB ASC 810-10. Distributions on the subordinated\ndebentures owned by the subsidiary trust have been classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring June 2020, the Parent Corporation issued $75 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the “2020\nNotes”). The 2020 Notes bear interest at 5.75% annually from, and including, the date of initial issuance to, but excluding, September 15, 2025 or the date of\nearlier redemption, payable semi-annually in arrears on September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2020. From and including\nSeptember 15, 2025 through maturity or earlier redemption, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which\nis expected to be Three-Month Term SOFR (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture), plus 560.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March\n15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the benchmark rate is less\nthan zero, then the benchmark rate shall be deemed to be zero.\nDuring January 2018, the Parent Corporation issued $75 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the “2018\nNotes”). The 2018 Notes bore interest at a rate that resets quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 284\nbasis points (2.84%) payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on the 2018 Notes was to be paid on February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1, of each year to\nbut excluding the stated maturity date, unless in any case previously redeemed. The 2018 Notes were redeemed in full on February 1, 2023.\nDuring June 2015, the Parent Corporation issued $50 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the “2015\nNotes”). As of December 31, 2020, the 2015 Notes had a stated maturity of July 1, 2025, and bore interest until the maturity date or early redemption date at a\nvariable rate equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 393 basis points. As of December 31, 2020, the variable interest rate was 4.16%, all costs\nrelated to 2015 issuance had been amortized and the 2015 Notes were redeemed in full on January 1, 2021.\n-65-\nTable of Contents\nPreferred Stock\nOn August 19, 2021, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 115,000 shares, or $115 million in aggregate liquidation preference,\nof its depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Company’s 5.25% Fixed-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A,\nno par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share.

We also\nhave audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by\nCOSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n-68-\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit\nmatter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Qualitative Loss Factors on Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans\nAs described in Note 1a to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit\nLosses. ASC 326 requires the measurement of expected lifetime credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost at the reporting date. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans was $81,974,000.\nManagement employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on pooled loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The\nmethodology for evaluating quantitative factors includes pooling loans into portfolio segments for loans that share similar characteristics. Pooled loan\nportfolio segments include commercial, commercial real estate, commercial construction, residential real estate, and consumer loans.\nFor pooled loans, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology to estimate credit losses over the expected life of the loan. The DCF\nmethodology combines probability of default, the loss given default, and prepayment speed assumptions to estimate a reserve for each loan. The quantitative\nloss rates are adjusted by macroeconomic scenarios and reverts, on a straight-line basis, to average historical losses after the forecasted periods. The sum of\nall the loan level reserves is aggregated for each portfolio segment and a quantitative loss factor is derived. The quantitative factors are also supplemented by\ncertain qualitative loss factors reflecting management’s view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. Qualitative loss\nfactors, for each loan segment within the portfolio, incorporate consideration for a minimum to maximum range for qualitative loss factor derived from either\nthe Company’s historical loss experience of peer group historical loss experience. Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the\nCompany’s financial results.\nWe identified auditing the qualitative component of the ACL on pooled loans in the commercial and commercial real estate loan segments as a critical audit\nmatter because the methodology to determine the estimate of credit losses uses subjective judgments by management and is subject to material variability.\n-69-\nTable of Contents\nPerforming audit procedures to evaluate the qualitative loss factors on the commercial and commercial real estate loan segments involved a high degree of\nauditor judgment and required significant effort, including the need to involve more experienced audit personnel including the use of internal specialists.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● Testing the effective of controls over the evaluation of the ACL on pooled loans, including controls addressing:\no Methodology and accounting policies.\no Data inputs, judgments and calculations used to determine the qualitative loss factors.\no Information technology general controls and application controls.\no Management’s evaluation of qualitative loss factors.\n● Substantively, testing management’s process, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions, for developing the ACL on pooled loans,\nwhich included:\no Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting policies, judgments and elections.\no Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\no Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation including utilizing internal specialists to assist in testing the\nmathematical accuracy of the underlying peer data used to develop the maximum loss factors.\no Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments related to qualitative loss factors to determine if they are calculated to\nconform with management’s policies and were consistently applied period over period.\n/s/ Crowe LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nLivingston, New Jersey\nFebruary 23, 2024\n-70-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (the “Parent Corporation”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey and is a registered bank holding\ncompany under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). The Parent Corporation’s business currently consists of the operation of\nits wholly-owned subsidiary, ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank” and, collectively with the Parent Corporation and the Parent Corporation’s subsidiaries, the\n“Company”) and making certain limited investments. The Bank’s direct and indirect subsidiaries include Union Investment Co. (a New Jersey investment\ncompany), Twin Bridge Investment Co. (a Delaware investment company), ConnectOne Preferred Funding Corp. (a New Jersey real estate investment trust),\nCenter Financial Group, LLC (a New Jersey financial services company), Center Advertising, Inc. (a New Jersey advertising company), Morris Property\nCompany, LLC, (a New Jersey limited liability company), Volosin Holdings, LLC, (a New Jersey limited liability company), NJCB Spec-1, LLC (a New Jersey\nlimited liability company), Port Jervis Holdings, LLC (a New Jersey limited liability company), BONJ Special Properties, LLC (a New Jersey limited liability\ncompany) and BoeFly, Inc. (a New Jersey financial technology company).\nThe Bank is a community-based, full-service New Jersey-chartered commercial bank that was founded in 2005. The Bank operates from its\nheadquarters located at 301 Sylvan Avenue in the Borough of Englewood Cliffs, Bergen County, New Jersey and through its 24 other banking offices.\nSubstantially all loans are secured with various types of collateral, including business assets, consumer assets and commercial/residential real estate. Each\nborrower’s ability to repay its loans is dependent on the conversion of assets, cash flows generated from the borrowers’ business, real estate rental and consumer\nwages.\nBasis of Presentation and Principals of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Parent Corporation are prepared on an accrual basis and include the accounts of the Parent Corporation and the Company. All\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated from the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSegments\nFASB ASC 28, “Segment Reporting,” requires companies to report certain information about operating segments. The Company is managed as one\nsegment: a community bank. All decisions including but not limited to loan growth, deposit funding, interest rate risk, credit risk and pricing are determined\nafter assessing the effect on the totality of the organization. For example, loan growth is dependent on the ability of the organization to fund this growth\nthrough deposits or other borrowings. As a result, the Company is managed as one operating segment.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of condition and that affect the results of operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from those estimates.\n- 76-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nRisks and Uncertainties\nRecent events impacting the financial services industry, including the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, have\nresulted in increased volatility and reduced valuations of equity and other securities of banks in the capital markets. In addition, the Federal Reserve, in order to\ncombat inflation, has employed quantitative tightening in order to reduce the size of its balance sheet, resulting in increased competition and costs for bank\ndeposits and an increased risk of an economic recession. These recent events have, and could continue to, increase competition for deposits and adversely\nimpact the market price and volatility of the Company’s common stock.\nThe United States economy is currently experiencing a level of price inflation not experienced since the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. It is therefore\ndifficult to predict the response of consumers and businesses to this level of inflation, and its impact on the economy. In addition, in order to attempt to control\nand reduce the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a series of interest rate increases along with quantitative tightening to further constrict\neconomic conditions. It is unclear whether the Federal Reserve’s efforts will be successful, and what impact they may have on the United States’ economy. It is\npossible that the combined effects of inflation and increases in market interest rates could cause the economy of the United States to enter a recession, which\ncould negatively affect the businesses of our borrowers and their ability to repay their loans or need credit, which could negatively affect our results of\noperations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, deposits with other financial institutions with maturities of less than 90 days, and federal funds sold. Net cash\nflows are reported for client loan and deposit transactions, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds purchased and repurchase\nagreements.\nInvestment Securities\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10-05. Investments are classified into the following categories: (1) held-to-maturity securities, for which the\nCompany has both the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, which are reported at amortized cost; (2) trading securities, which are purchased and\nheld principally for the purpose of selling in the near term and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; and (3)\navailable-for-sale securities, which do not meet the criteria of the other two categories and which management believes may be sold prior to maturity due to\nchanges in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity or other factors, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income\ntaxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in stockholders’ equity and excluded from earnings.\nInvestment securities are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts as adjustments to interest income, which are recognized on\na level yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Investment securities gains or\nlosses are determined using the specific identification method.\nSecurities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest\nincome includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are generally amortized using the level-yield method\nwithout estimating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities, where prepayment rates are estimated. Premiums on callable investment securities are\namortized to their earliest call date. Gains and losses on sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification\nmethod.\n- 77-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nFor available-for-sale investment securities which are in an unrealized loss position, the Company will first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is\nmore likely than not, that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria is met, the amortized cost\nbasis of the security is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale investment securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we\nevaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from an actual or estimated credit loss event or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the\nextent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among\nother factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss is likely, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to\nthe amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for\ncredit losses is recorded for the estimated credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not\nbeen recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company elected the practical expedient of\nzero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, are highly rated by major agencies and have a long history of no credit losses.\nEquity Securities\nThe Company’s investments in equity securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nResidential mortgage loans, originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value\nas determined by outstanding commitments from investors. For these loans originated and intended for sale, gains and losses on loan sales (sale proceeds minus\ncarrying value) are recorded in other income and direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in other income\nupon sale of the loan.\nOther loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value. Fair value on these loans is determined based on the terms\nof the loan, such as interest rate, maturity date, and reset term, as well as sales of similar assets.\nLoans\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance\noutstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs, purchase premium and discounts and an allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid\nprincipal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method\nwithout anticipating prepayments.\nLoan segments are defined as a group of loans, which share similar initial measurement attributes, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and\nassessing credit risk. Management has determined that the Company has five segments of loans: commercial, commercial real estate, commercial construction,\nresidential real estate (including home equity) and consumer.\n- 78-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nLoans that are 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income unless the\nloans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In certain cases, loans are placed on\nnonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance\nhomogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for credit losses and loans individually analyzed for credit losses.\nAll interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted\nfor on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest\namounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nThe policy of the Company is to grant commercial, residential and consumer loans to residents and businesses within the market-areas served by its\noffices in New Jersey, New York and Florida. The borrowers’ abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors including the borrowers’\nincome and net worth, cash flows generated by the borrowers’ underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the lender’s lien on the\nproperty. Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the control of the Company. The Company is\ntherefore subject to risk of loss. The Company believes its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that\nadequate provisions for credit losses are provided for all known and inherent risks. Collateral and/or personal guarantees are required for a large majority of the\nCompany’s loans.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of current expected credit losses considering available information relevant to assessing collectability of\ncash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet\ndate. The measurement of expected credit losses is applicable to loans receivable and investment securities measured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of credit. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses when the\nCompany believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance is established through a provision for credit losses that is charged against income. The methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses is\nconsidered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the\npotential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses. The\nexpected credit loss for unfunded loan commitments is reported on the consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities.\nFor financial assets, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the financial\nassets to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. The Company's methodology to estimate the allowance for credit losses has\ntwo components: (i) a collective reserve component for estimated lifetime expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and\n(ii) an individual reserve component for loans that do not share common risk characteristics. The Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit\ncommitments mainly consisting of undisbursed non-cancellable lines of credit, new loan commitments and commercial letters of credit.\nInformation relevant to establishing an estimate of current expected credit losses includes historical credit loss experience on financial assets with\nsimilar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the\ncontractual term of the financial assets. The Company reports in net income (as a credit loss expense) the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit\nlosses and liabilities for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures for the current estimate of expected credit losses.\n- 79-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nExpected credit losses of financial assets are measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristic(s) exist. If the Company determines\nthat a financial asset does not share risk characteristics with other financial assets, the Company will evaluate the financial asset for expected credit losses on an\nindividual basis. Financial assets are assessed once, either through collective assessments or individual assessments. Standard expected losses are evaluated on a\ncollective, or pool, basis when financial assets share similar risk characteristics. For pooled loan segments, utilizing a quantitative analysis, the Company\ncalculates estimated credit losses using a probability of default and loss given default methodology, the results of which are applied to the aggregated\ndiscounted cash flow of each individual loan within the segment. In the absence of relevant and reliable internal data, probability of default and loss given\ndefault rates are determined using peer data. The point in time probability of default and loss given default are then conditioned by macroeconomic scenarios to\nincorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Financial assets may be segmented based on one\ncharacteristic, or a combination of characteristics. Examples of risk characteristics relevant to the Company’s evaluation include, but were not limited to: (1)\nInternal or external credit scores or credit ratings, (2) Risk ratings or classifications, (3) Financial asset type, (4) Collateral type, (5) Size, (6) Effective interest\nrate, (7) Term, (8) Geographical location, (9) Industry of the borrower and (10) Vintage.\nThe Company’s quantitative analysis also considers relevant available information from internal and external sources related to past events and current\nconditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company evaluates a variety of factors including third party economic\nforecasts, industry trends and other available published economic information in arriving at its forecasts. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period,\nthe Company reverts, on a straight-line basis, to average historical losses. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted\nfor expected prepayments when appropriate.\nIncluded in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company’s assessment, may not be\nadequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Each qualitative loss factor, for each loan segment within the portfolio,\nincorporates consideration for a minimum to maximum range for loss factors derived from either the Company’s historical loss experience, or peer group\nhistorical charge-off experience. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses and are\napplied to each loan segment.\nThe Bank evaluates individual instruments for expected credit losses when those instruments do not share similar risk characteristics with instruments\nevaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. The Company evaluates the pooling methodology at least annually. Loans transition from defined segments for\nindividual analysis when credit characteristics, or risk traits, change in a material manner. A loan is considered for individual analysis when, based on current\ninformation and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the\ncontractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by the Company in determining individual analysis include payment status and the probability of\ncollecting scheduled principal and interest payments, when due.\nNonaccrual loans that are $250,000 or higher and all purchased credit-deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans are individually analyzed. For loans designated as\nnonaccrual with balances of less than $250,000, these loans are collectively evaluated, and, accordingly, are not separately identified for analysis or\ndisclosures. Instruments will not be included in either collective and individual analysis. Individual analysis will establish a specific reserve for instruments in\nscope.\nFor collateral dependent loans, when it is determined that a foreclosure is probable, the allowance for credit losses is determined on a loan level basis\nusing the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated disposition costs (“net fair value”), which will ensure that the credit loss is not\ndelayed until the time at which the actual foreclosure takes place. In the event that this fair value is less than then amortized cost basis of these specific loans,\nthe Company will recognize the difference between the net fair value at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis in the allowance for credit losses. If the\nfair value of the collateral has increased as of the evaluation date, the increase in the fair value of the collateral is reflected through a reduction in the allowance\nfor credit losses. Adjustments for estimated disposition costs are not appropriate when the repayment of a collateral-dependent loan is expected from the\noperation of the collateral. If repayment is based upon future expected cash flows, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s\noriginal effective interest rate is compared to the carrying value of the loan, and any shortfall is recorded as the allowance for credit losses. The effective\ninterest rate used to discount expected cash flows is adjusted to incorporate expected prepayments, if applicable.\n- 80-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nPurchased Credit-Deteriorated Loans\nLoans acquired in a business combination that have experienced a more-than-significant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered\nPCD loans. The Company evaluates acquired loans for deterioration in credit quality based on any of, but not limited to, the following: (1) non-accrual status;\n(2) troubled debt restructured designation; (3) risk ratings of special mention, substandard or doubtful; (4) watchlist credits; and (5) delinquency status,\nincluding loans that were current on acquisition date, but had been previously delinquent. At the acquisition date, an estimate of expected credit losses is made\nfor groups of PCD loans with similar risk characteristics and individual PCD loans without similar risk characteristics. This initial allowance for credit losses is\nallocated to individual PCD loans and added to the purchase price or acquisition date fair values to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the PCD loans.\nAs the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price, there is no credit loss expense recognized upon acquisition of a PCD loan. Any\ndifference between the unpaid principal balance of PCD loans and the amortized cost basis is considered to relate to noncredit factors and results in a discount\nor premium, which is recognized through interest income on a level-yield basis over the lives of the related loans. All loans considered to be purchased credit-\nimpaired (\"PCI\") prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 were converted to PCD upon adoption.\nPCD loans that met the criteria for nonaccrual may be considered performing, regardless of whether the client is contractually delinquent, if\nmanagement can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of the expected cash flows on such loans and if management expects to fully collect the new\ncarrying value of the loans. As such, management may no longer consider the loans to be nonaccrual or nonperforming and may accrue interest on these loans,\nincluding the impact of any accretable discount.\nDerivatives\nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being\nhedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in noninterest income. Cash flows on hedges are classified in\nthe cash flow statement the same as the cash flows of the items being hedged.\nThe Company formally documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and the strategy\nfor undertaking hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes linking cash flow hedges to specific assets and\nliabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception\nand on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged\nitems. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash\nflows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer\nfirm, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a cash flow\nhedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other\ncomprehensive income are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings.\n- 81-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nRestricted Stock\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of New York. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the\nlevel of borrowings and other factors and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically\nevaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Cash dividends on the stock are reported as income.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed\nto be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking\nadvantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an\nagreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nPremises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost and premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings and related components are depreciated\nusing the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 4 to 30 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the\nterms of the respective leases, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated using\nthe straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease team. The Company includes lease extension and termination options in the lease term if, after considering\nrelevant economic factors, it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option.\nRight-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation\nto make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated\npresent value of the lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to calculate the present\nvalue of lease payments when the rate implicit in a lease is not known. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with original terms of 12 months or\nless on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned (“OREO”), representing property acquired through foreclosure and held-for-sale, is initially recorded at fair value less cost to\nsell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequently, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at\nthe lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Costs relating to holding the assets are charged to expenses.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a noncontributory pension plan that covered all eligible employees up until September 30, 2007, at which time the Company froze\nits defined benefit pension plan. As such, all future benefit accruals in this pension plan were discontinued and all retirement benefits that employees would\nhave earned as of September 30, 2007 were preserved. The Company’s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974. The costs associated with the plan are accrued based on actuarial assumptions and included in salaries and employee\nbenefits expense.\n- 82-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nThe Company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with FASB ASC 715-30. FASB ASC 715-30 requires that the funded status\nof defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the Company’s statement of financial condition and changes in the funded status be reflected in other\ncomprehensive income. FASB ASC 715-30 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year-end.\nThe Company maintains a 401(k)-employee savings plan to provide for defined contributions which covers substantially all employees of the\nCompany. Employee 401(k) and profit-sharing plan expense is the amount of matching contributions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock compensation accounting guidance (FASB ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation”) requires that the compensation cost related to\nshare-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability\ninstruments issued. The stock compensation accounting guidance covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including stock options,\nrestricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans.\nStock compensation accounting guidance requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and recognized over the employees’\nservice period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period for the entire award. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nTreasury Stock\nSubject to certain regulatory limitations applicable to the Parent Corporation, treasury stock purchases may be made from time to time as, in the\nopinion of management, market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Shares repurchased are added to the corporate\nreasury and will be used for future stock dividends and other issuances. The repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock, which results in a decrease in\ntockholders’ equity. Treasury stock is recorded using the cost method and accordingly is presented as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. During the years\nended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Parent Corporation repurchased 904,152 and 447,108 shares, respectively, under board-approved share\nepurchase programs.\nOn August 16, 2022, The Inflation Reduction Act, P.L. 117-169, was signed into law. The act included a new Sec. 4501 that imposes an excise tax on\ncertain repurchases of stock by publicly traded corporations.\nIn general, and before considering exceptions, the amount of the excise tax is equal to 1% of (1) the aggregate fair market value (FMV) of stock\nrepurchased by a corporation, over (2) the aggregate FMV of stock issued by the corporation, in each case, during the tax year. The excise tax applies to\nrepurchases of stock by corporations beginning after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is not deductible for purposes of computing U.S. federal income tax\n(Sec. 275(a)(6)).\nOn December 27, 2022, Treasury and the IRS released Notice 2023-2, which announced that they intend to issue proposed regulations with respect to\nthe excise tax. The notice provides interim guidance that Treasury and the Service generally intend to include in the proposed regulations, including several\nexamples that illustrate the application of the rules set forth in the notice. Treasury and the IRS anticipate that the proposed regulations will be consistent with\nthe guidance provided in the notice. In addition, until the issuance of the proposed regulations, taxpayers are permitted to rely on the operating rules set forth in\nSection 3 of the notice. The proposed regulations are anticipated to apply to repurchases of stock made after December 31, 2022, and to issuances of stock made\nduring a tax year ending after December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company accrued $0.2 million related to the excise tax through equity.\n- 83-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1a – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair\nvalue of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill\nand intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but tested for impairment\nannually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected\nDecember 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. No impairment charge was deemed necessary as of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles arising from business combinations that are amortized over their estimated useful lives to\ntheir estimated residual value.\nComprehensive Income\nTotal comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner\nsources. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of unrealized holding gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, unrecognized\nactuarial gains and losses of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, net of taxes.\nRestrictions on Cash\nCash on hand or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank is required to meet regulatory reserve and clearing requirements.\nDividend Restriction\nBanking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the Parent Corporation or by the Parent\nCorporation to the stockholders.\n- 84-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors,\nespecially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company invests in Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”) to help offset the cost of employee benefits. The change in the cash surrender value of\nthe BOLI is recorded as a component of noninterest income.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities,\ncomputed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax\nexamination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on\nexamination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company recognizes its marketing and advertising costs as incurred.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for 2022 and 2021 to conform to the classifications\npresented in 2023. Such reclassifications had no impact on net income or stockholders’ equity.\n- 85-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual\nestriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair\nvalue. We adopted ASU 2022-03 on January 1, 2024 and it did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02, “Financial Instruments –\nCredit Losses (Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures” (“ASU 2022-02”). ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for\nroubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) in ASC 310-40, “Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors” for entities that have adopted the current\nexpected credit loss (“CECL”) model introduced by ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments” (ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2022-02 also requires that public business entities disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination\nfor financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized\nCost”.

These amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2)\nrovide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5% of\nhe amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The amendments require that all entities disclose on\nn annual basis the following information about income taxes paid: 1) The amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal\nnational), state, and foreign taxes. 2) The amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes\naid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amendments also require that all entities\ndisclose the following information: 1) Income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and\noreign and 2) Income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign.

Fair value is based upon either quoted market prices, or in certain cases\nwhere there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions are made to determine their fair value.

The new CECL methodology replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model that previously existed. The Company did not\nhave a CECL day 1 impact attributable to its investment securities portfolio and did not have an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023. The\nCompany has elected to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost of its investment securities available-for-sale. Accrued interest receivable for\ninvestment securities available for sale as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, totaled $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\n- 90-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 3 – Investment Securities – (continued)\nThe Company evaluates securities in an unrealized loss position for impairment related to credit losses on at least a quarterly basis. Securities in\nunrealized loss positions are first assessed as to whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before\nrecovery of its amortized cost basis. If one of the criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through current earnings. For\nsecurities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment\nindicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for\ncredit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on asset backed\nsecurities and state and municipal securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell, and it\nis likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates\nand other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded\nthrough an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. No allowance for credit losses for available-for-\nsale securities was recorded as of December 31, 2023.\nFederal agency obligations, residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities and commercial mortgage-backed pass-through securities are issued\nby U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Although a government guarantee exists on these investments, these entities are not\nlegally backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, and the current support they receive is subject to a cap as part of the agreement entered\ninto in 2008. Nonetheless, at this time we do not foresee any set of circumstances in which the government would not fund its commitments on these\ninvestments as the issuers are an integral part of the U.S. housing market in providing liquidity and stability. Therefore, we concluded that a zero-allowance\napproach for these investment securities is appropriate.\n- 91-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

During 2023, the Company took actions to increase its secured borrowing access and\nincrease levels of off-balance sheet liquidity and as such increased the amount of loans pledged to each of these borrowing facilities.\n• The repayment of commercial loans is generally dependent on the creditworthiness and cash flow of borrowers, and if applicable, guarantors,\nwhich may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions. While the majority of these loans are secured, collateral type, marketing,\ncoverage, valuation and monitoring is not as uniform as in other portfolio classes and recovery from liquidation of such collateral may be subject\nto greater variability.\n• Payment on commercial real estate is driven principally by operating results of the managed properties or underlying business and secondarily by\nthe sale or refinance of such properties. Both primary and secondary sources of repayment, and value of the properties in liquidation, may be\naffected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general.\n• Properties underlying construction, land and land development loans often do not generate sufficient cash flows to service debt and thus\nrepayment is subject to the ability of the borrower and, if applicable, guarantors, to complete development or construction of the property and\ncarry the project, often for extended periods of time. As a result, the performance of these loans is contingent upon future events whose\nprobability at the time of origination is uncertain.\n• The ability of borrowers to service debt in the residential and consumer loan portfolios is generally subject to personal income which may be\nimpacted by general economic conditions, such as increased unemployment levels. These loans are predominately collateralized by first and/or\nsecond liens on single family properties. If a borrower cannot maintain the loan, the Company’s ability to recover against the collateral in\nsufficient amount and in a timely manner may be significantly influenced by market, legal and regulatory conditions.\n• The Company considers loan classes and loan segments to be one and the same.\n- 92-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 4 – Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses – (continued)\nCredit Quality Indicators – The Company continuously monitors the credit quality of its loans receivable. In addition to its internal monitoring, the\nCompany utilizes the services of a third-party loan review firm to periodically validate the credit quality of its loans receivable on a sample basis. Credit quality\nis monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators. Assets classified as “Pass” are deemed to possess average to superior credit quality, requiring no\nmore than normal attention. Assets classified as “Special Mention” have generally acceptable credit quality yet possess higher risk\ncharacteristics/circumstances than satisfactory assets. Such conditions include strained liquidity, slow pay, stale financial statements, or other conditions that\nrequire more stringent attention from the lending staff. These conditions, if not corrected, may weaken the loan quality or inadequately protect the Company’s\ncredit position at some future date. Assets are classified as “Substandard” if the asset has a well-defined weakness that requires management’s attention to a\ngreater degree than for loans classified as special mention. Such weakness, if left uncorrected, could possibly result in the compromised ability of the loan to\nperform to contractual requirements. An asset is classified as “Doubtful” if it is inadequately protected by the net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or\nof the collateral, if any, that secures the obligation. Assets classified as doubtful include assets for which there is a “distinct possibility” that a degree of loss\nwill occur if the inadequacies are not corrected.\n- 94-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

In general, the step zero test allows\nan entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than\nits carrying value. If a step zero impairment test results in the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its\ncarrying value, then no further testing is required.\nDue to recent declines in bank stock prices and events impacting the banking industry, the Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis as\nof December 31, 2023. The annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for the reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (\"income\napproach\") and estimates of selected market information (\"market approaches\"). The income approach measures the fair value of an interest in a business by\ndiscounting expected future cash flows to present value. The market approaches take into consideration fair values of comparable companies operating in\nsimilar lines of business that are potentially subject to similar economic and environmental factors and could be considered reasonable investment alternatives.\nThe result of the income approach was weighted 50% and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 50% in determining the fair value of\nthe reporting unit. The results of the annual quantitative impairment analysis indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nBased upon management’s review through December 31, 2023, the Company’s goodwill was not impaired. Management concludes that the ASC 350\ngoodwill step zero test has been passed, and no further testing is required.\nGoodwill\nThe change in goodwill during the year is as follows:\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance, January 1 $ 208,372 $ 208,372\nAcquired goodwill - -\nImpairment - -\nBalance, December 31 $ 208,372 $ 208,372\n- 106-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

On December 19, 2003, Center\nBancorp Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Corporation issued $5.0 million of MMCapS capital securities\nto investors due on January 23, 2034. The capital securities presently qualify as Tier I capital. The trust loaned the proceeds of this offering to the Company and\nreceived in exchange $5.2 million of the Parent Corporation’s subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to\nmaturity. The floating interest rate on the subordinate debentures was previously three-month LIBOR plus 2.85% and reprices quarterly. Upon the cessation of\npublication of LIBOR rates and pursuant to the Federal LIBOR Act and Federal Reserve regulations implementing the Act, applicable US Dollar LIBOR\nindexed instruments like the Company’s outstanding $5.0 million of MMCapS capital securities converted effective June 30, 2023 to a new index based on\nCME Term SOFR, as defined in the LIBOR Act, plus a tenor spread adjustment, which is referred to as the Benchmark Replacement. Therefore, effective for\nquarterly interest rate resets after July 3, 2023 the subordinated debentures’ floating rate will be three-month CME Term SOFR plus 2.85% plus a tenor spread\nadjust of 0.26161%. The rate as of December 31, 2023 was 8.50%. These subordinated debentures and the related income effects are not eliminated in the\nconsolidated financial statements, as the statutory business trust is not consolidated in accordance with FASB ASC 810-10.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which\nthose temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the projected future taxable income,\nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. During 2023 and 2022, based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable\nincome over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be\nrealized. There are no unrecorded tax benefits, and the Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits to significantly increase\nin the next twelve months.\nThe Company’s federal income tax returns are open and subject to examination from the 2020 tax return year and forward. The Company’s state\nincome tax returns are generally open from the 2019 and later tax return years based on individual state statutes of limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has $13.1 million in New Jersey net operating loss (NOL). The NOL is set to expire on December 31, 2040.\n- 112-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

The net proceeds received from the issuance of preferred stock at the time of closing were\n$110.9 million.\nNote 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations of Credit Risk\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as standby and commercial letters of\ncredit, unused portions of lines of credit and commitments to extend various types of credit. Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit\ngenerally do not exceed one year.\nThese financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements. The commitment or contract amount of these financial instruments is an indicator of the Company’s level of involvement in each type of instrument\nas well as the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument.\nThe Company controls the credit risk of these financial instruments through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. To minimize potential\ncredit risk, the Company generally requires collateral and other credit-related terms and conditions from the client. In the opinion of management, the financial\ncondition of the Company will not be materially affected by the final outcome of these commitments and contingent liabilities. A substantial portion of the\nBank’s loans are secured by real estate located in New Jersey and New York. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio of the\nBank is susceptible to changes in the metropolitan New York real estate market.\nThe following table provides a summary of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nCommitments under commercial loans and lines of credit $ 723,228 $ 662,515\nHome equity and other revolving lines of credit 48,786 54,302\nOutstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments 370,574 433,034\nStandby letters of credit 23,562 20,770\nOverdraft protection lines 829 905\nTotal $ 1,166,979 $ 1,171,526\nThe Company is subject to claims and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business.

The Company leases banking\noffices from related party entities. In addition, the Company also utilizes an advertising and public relations agency at which one of the Company’s directors is\nPresident and CEO and a principal owner. For these transactions, the expenses are not significant to the operations of the Company.\nNote 14 – Stockholders’ Equity and Regulatory Requirements\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy\nguidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to\nmeet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. The accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss on securities and derivatives is not included in\ncomputing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2023, the Bank and the Parent Corporation meet all capital adequacy requirements to\nwhich they are subject.\nPrompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly\nundercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If an institution is classified as\nadequately capitalized or lower, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is growth\nand expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as\nwell capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management\nbelieves have changed the institution’s category.\n- 114-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

This data forms the basis for the construction of a best-estimate range of real investment returns for each asset class. A weighted average\nreal-return range is computed reflecting the plan’s expected asset mix, and that range, when combined with an expected inflation range, produces an overall\nbest-estimate expected return range. Specific factors such as the plan’s investment policy, reinvestment risk and investment volatility are taken into\nconsideration during the construction of the best estimate real return range, as well as in the selection of the final return assumption from within the range.\nPlan Assets\nThe general investment policy of the Pension Trust is for the fund to experience growth in assets that will allow the market value to exceed the value\nof benefit obligations over time.

Other debt securities are valued based upon recent bid prices or the average of recent bid and asked prices when available (Level 2 inputs)\nand, if not available, they are valued through matrix pricing models developed by sources considered by management to be reliable. Matrix pricing, which is a\nmathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded, values debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices\nfor the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted\nprices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3).\nDiscounted cash flows are calculated using spread to continuous yield or quoted market pricing curves. During times when trading is more liquid, broker\nquotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are\nreviewed and incorporated into the calculations.\nThe investment manager is not authorized to purchase, acquire or otherwise hold certain types of market securities (subordinated bonds, real estate\ninvestment trusts, limited partnerships, naked puts, naked calls, stock index futures, oil, gas or mineral exploration ventures or unregistered securities) or to\nemploy certain types of market techniques (margin purchases or short sales) or to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, or in any manner transfer as security for\nindebtedness, any security owned or held by the Plan.\nCash Flows\nContributions\nThe Bank does not expect to make a contribution in 2024.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, for the following years are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n2024 $ 709\n2025 707\n2026 710\n2027 752\n2028 752\n2029 - 2033 3,598\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) plan to provide for defined contributions which covers substantially all employees of the Company. Beginning with\nthe 2014 plan year, the 401(k) plan was amended to provide for a match of 50% of elective contributions, up to 6% of an employee’s contribution.

The Plan eliminates all remaining\nissuable shares under previous plans and is the only outstanding plan as of December 31, 2023. The Plan was amended in 2023 so that the maximum number of\nshares of common stock or equivalents which may be issued under the Plan, is 750,000. Grants under the Plan can be in the form of stock options (qualified or\nnon-qualified), restricted shares, restricted share units or performance units. Shares available for grant and issuance under the Plan as of December 31, 2023 are\napproximately 469,501. The Company intends to issue all shares under the Plan in the form of newly issued shares.\nRestricted stock, options and deferred stock units typically have a three-year vesting period starting one year after the date of grant with one-third\nvesting each year. The options generally expire ten years from the date of the grant. Restricted stock granted to new employees and board members may be\ngranted with shorter vesting periods. Grants of performance units typically have a cliff vesting after three years or upon a change of control.

Should this expectation change, additional compensation expense could be recorded in future periods or previously recognized expense\ncould be reversed. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of performance units that ultimately could vest if performance targets were exceeded is\n233,087. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 116,192 shares vested. A total of 63,839 shares were netted from the vested shares to satisfy employee tax\nobligations. The net shares issued from vesting of performance units during the year ended December 31, 2023 were 52,353 shares.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 19 – Derivatives\nAs part of our overall asset liability management and strategy the Company uses derivative instruments, which can include interest rate swaps, collars,\ncaps, and floors. The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional\namount and the other terms of the individual agreements. Derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and are not reported on a\nnet basis.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedges\nSubsequent changes in fair value for a hedging instrument that has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship are accounted for\nin the following manner:\n1) Cash flow hedges: changes in fair value are recognized as a component in other comprehensive income\n2) Fair value hedges: changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings\nAs long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting\ntreatment, 100% of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are accounted for as outlined above. This is the case whether or not economic\nmismatches exist in the hedging relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge\ngains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument that is\nincluded in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is presented in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged\nitem.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company entered into eleven pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps, with a total notional amount of $500 million, all of which were entered into in\n2021 and 2022. These are designated as cash flow hedges of current, Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We are required to pay fixed rates of interest ranging\nfrom 0.63% to 3.41% and receive variable rates of interest that reset quarterly based on the daily compounding secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). All\nswaps carry expiration dates on the eleven positions ranging from December 2025 to March 2028. The swaps are determined to be fully effective during the\nperiod presented and therefore no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swap is recorded in\nother assets (liabilities) with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) would be reclassified to current earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully\neffective during the remaining term of the swaps.\nThe Company previously entered into one forward starting interest rate cap spread transaction, with a total notional amount of $150 million, which\nbecame effective on October 1, 2022 and matures in October of 2027 and one additional interest rate cap spread transaction, with a total notional amount of $75\nmillion, which became effective in November 2022 and matures in November of 2027. These are designated as cash flow hedges of brokered certificates of\ndeposits, and the interest rate cap spread is indexed to a benchmark of fed funds with payment required on a monthly basis. The structure of these instruments is\nsuch that the Company entered into a total of $225 million in notional amount of sold interest rate cap agreements, in which we are required to pay the\ncounterparty an incremental amount if the index rate exceeds a set cap rate. Simultaneously, the Company purchased a total of $225 million notional amount of\ninterest rate cap agreements in which we receive an incremental amount if the index rate is above a set cap rate. No payments are required if the index rate is at,\nor below, the cap rate on the sold or purchased interest rate cap agreements.\nInterest (income) expense recorded on these swap and cap transactions totaled approximately $(20.2) million, $(3.3) million, and $1.9 million during\n2023, 2022, and 2021 is reported as a component of either interest expense on FHLB Advances or brokered certificates of deposits.\n- 125-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 20 – Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nFASB ASC 820-10-05 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure\nof fair value measurements and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of\ninputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.\nFASB ASC 820-10-65 provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820-10-05 when the volume and level of\nactivity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. This ASC also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not\norderly.\nFASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives\nthe highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820-10-05 are as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (for example,\nsupported with little or no market activity).\nAn asset’s or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The\nfollowing information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a\nlimited portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the\nestimates, comparisons between the Company’s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nSecurities Available-for-Sale: Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation\nhierarchy. Level 1 inputs include securities that have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair\nvalues are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of instruments, which\nwould generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy include municipal bonds and certain agency collateralized mortgage obligations. In\ncertain cases where there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions must be made to determine the fair value of the instruments\nand these are classified as Level 3. When measuring fair value, the valuation techniques available under the market approach, income approach and/or cost\napproach are used. The Company’s evaluations are based on market data and the Company employs combinations of these approaches for its valuation methods\ndepending on the asset class.\nDerivatives: The fair value of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (level 2). Our\nderivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are\ndetermined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates,\nprices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rate, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are\nactively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\n- 127-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Specific reserves are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Specific reserves are\ngenerally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the specific reserve amount\napplicable to that loan does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is valued using independent appraisals or other indications\nof value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable by market participants. However, due to the substantial\njudgment applied and limited volume of activity as compared to other assets, fair value is based on Level 3 inputs.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 20 – Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments – (continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFASB ASC 825-10 requires all entities to disclose the estimated fair value of their financial instrument assets and liabilities. For the Company, as for\nmost financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments as defined in FASB ASC 825-10. Many of the\nCompany’s financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange\ntransaction. It is also the Company’s general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments to maturity and not to engage in trading or sales activities\nexcept for loans held-for-sale and investment securities available-for-sale. Therefore, significant estimations and assumptions, as well as present value\ncalculations, were used by the Company for the purposes of this disclosure.\nFair values for financial instruments must be estimated by management using techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and comparison to\nsimilar instruments. These estimates are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash\nflows and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. Changes in these judgments often have a material effect on the fair\nvalue estimates. Since these estimates are made as of a specific point in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes. Fair values disclosed in\naccordance with ASC Topic 825 do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from the sale of a large volume of a particular financial instrument,\nnor do they reflect possible tax ramifications or estimated transaction costs.\nCash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values.\nFHLB stock. It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.\nLoans. The fair value of portfolio loans, net is determined using an exit price methodology. The exit price methodology continues to be based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, in which projected cash flows are based on contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayments for certain loan types (e.g.,\nresidential mortgage loans and multi-family loans) and the use of a discount rate based on expected relative risk of the cash flows. The discount rate selected\nconsiders loan type, maturity date, a liquidity premium, cost to service, and cost of capital, which is a Level 3 fair value estimate.\nDeposits. The carrying amounts of deposits with no stated maturities (i.e., non‐interest-bearing, savings, NOW, and money market deposits) are\nassigned fair values equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair value of time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash\nflows using estimated rates currently offered for alternative funding sources of similar remaining maturity.\nTerm Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 20 – Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments – (continued)\nThe fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, considering the\nremaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the\ndifference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of letters of credit and lines of credit are based on fees currently\ncharged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. The fair\nvalue of commitments to originate loans is immaterial and not included in the tables above.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on these estimated fair values.\nThe Company’s remaining assets and liabilities, which are not considered financial instruments, have not been valued differently than has been\ncustomary with historical cost accounting. No disclosure of the relationship value of the Company’s core deposit base is required by FASB ASC 825-10.\nFair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business\nand the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, there are certain significant assets and liabilities that are not\nconsidered financial assets or liabilities, such as the brokerage network, deferred taxes, premises and equipment, and goodwill. In addition, the tax\nramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in\nthe estimates.\nManagement believes that reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely, due to the wide range of permitted valuation\ntechniques and numerous estimates which must be made, given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of\nuniform valuation methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.\n- 135-\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or\nsubmitted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange\nAct reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the\nCompany evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of December 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that\nthe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-\n15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management, Board\nof Directors and shareholders regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external\nreporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and\nprocedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide\nreasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the\nCompany; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n-139-\nTable of Contents\nAs part of the Company’s program to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management assessed the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 (the “Assessment”). In making this Assessment, management used the control\ncriteria framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission published in its report entitled Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013). Management’s Assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its Assessment with\nthe Audit Committee.\nBased on this Assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nCrowe LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The report is included in\nthis item under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

Burns hereby jointly certify as follows:\nThey are the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”);\nTo the best of their knowledge, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Report”) complies in all material\nrespects with the requirements of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and\nTo the best of their knowledge, based upon a review of the Report, the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial\ncondition and results of operations of the Company.\nDate: February 23, 2024 By: /s/ Frank Sorrentino III\nFrank Sorrentino III\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nDate: February 23, 2024 By: /s/ William S. Burns\nWilliam S. Burns\nSenior Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer\nExhibit 97\nConnectOne Bancorp, Inc.\nCompensation Recoupment Policy\nThe Board of Directors of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") believes it is desirable, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, to\nmaintain and enhance a culture that is focused on integrity, accountability and that discourages conduct detrimental to the Company's risk profile and\nsustainable growth. Therefore, it may be appropriate for the Company to recover Incentive Compensation (as defined herein) provided to certain employees,\nand it may be appropriate for those employees to repay such Incentive Compensation, in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting\nrestatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required\naccounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would\nresult in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (an “Accounting Restatement”). The\nBoard of Directors has adopted the following Compensation Recoupment Policy (the \"Policy\") effective as of the date set forth above (the \"Effective Date\").\nThe Policy applies to the Company’s Executive Officers (as defined below).\nAdditional Definitions\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that\notherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the amounts reflected in the Accounting Restatement, and must be computed without\nregard to any taxes paid. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation\nis not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement:\n(A) The amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon\nwhich the Incentive Compensation was received; and\n(B) The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq.\n\"Executive Officer\" shall mean the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the\ncontroller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other\nofficer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the\nCompany’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy making functions for the Company. As used\nherein, a policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant.\n1\nConnectOne Bancorp, Inc.\nCompensation Recoupment Policy\n“Financial Reporting Measures” means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return shall be\nconsidered financial reporting measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n\"Incentive Compensation\" shall mean any compensation payable in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, restricted stock units or stock options, that is\ngranted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any Financial Reporting Measure. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive Compensation\nwill be deemed “received” by the Executive Officer for purposes of this policy in the fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure is attained,\neven if the payment or grant occurs after the end of that period.\n\"Restatement Date\" shall mean the date that the Company concluded (or reasonably should have concluded), whether through its Board of Directors, a\ncommittee of the Board of Directors, or through officers of the Company if such officers are authorized to take such action without Board action, that an\nAccounting Restatement is required, or the date that a court or regulator directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\nRecoupment of Incentive Compensation\nIf the Company incurs an Accounting Restatement, then the Company shall promptly require each current or former Executive Officer who received Incentive\nCompensation to reimburse the Company any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by such Executive Officer during the three completed fiscal years\nimmediately preceding the Restatement Date.\nFor the sake of clarity, Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be recovered even if there was no misconduct or failure of oversight on the part an individual\nExecutive Officer.\nRecoupment Amount and Procedures\nThe amount required to be reimbursed or returned to the Company shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the\n\"Committee\") and will equal the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\nThe Company will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for obtaining reimbursement or return of payments made, which may include, but is not limited\nto: (i) by offsetting the amount from any compensation owed by the Company to the affected Executive Officer (including, without limitation, amounts payable\nunder a deferred compensation plan at such time as is permitted by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended): (ii) by reducing or\neliminating future salary increases, cash incentive awards or equity awards; or (iii) by requiring the individual to pay the amount to the Company upon its\nwritten demand for such payment.\n2\nConnectOne Bancorp, Inc.\nCompensation Recoupment Policy\nExceptions to Recovery.\nExceptions to the foregoing policy of recoupment are only available where:\n(i) pursuing such recovery would be impracticable because the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy would exceed\nthe recoverable amounts and the Company has (A) made a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts and (B) provided documentation of\nsuch attempts to recover to the Nasdaq; or\n(ii) recoupment would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nregistrant, to fail to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.\nMiscellaneous\nThe Board of Directors intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent permitted by law. In addition, the Committee may determine that any equity\naward agreement, employment agreement or similar agreement entered into or amended after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit\ncovered by such agreement, require the affected employee to contractually agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Further, the adoption of this Policy does\nnot mitigate, and is intended to enhance, the effect of any recoupment or similar policies in any equity award agreement, employment agreement or similar\nagreement in effect prior to the Effective Date.\nBinding on Successors\nThe terms of this Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all employees and their heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.\n3"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 1a. Nature of Operations, Principles of Consolidation and Risk and Uncertainties\nNature of Operations\nConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (the “Parent Corporation”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey and is a registered bank holding\ncompany under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). The Parent Corporation’s business currently consists of the operation of\nits wholly-owned subsidiary, ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank” and, collectively with the Parent Corporation and the Parent Corporation’s subsidiaries, the\n“Company”) and making certain limited investments. The Bank’s direct and indirect subsidiaries include Union Investment Co. (a New Jersey investment\ncompany), Twin Bridge Investment Co. (a Delaware investment company), ConnectOne Preferred Funding Corp. (a New Jersey real estate investment trust),\nCenter Financial Group, LLC (a New Jersey financial services company), Center Advertising, Inc. (a New Jersey advertising company), Morris Property\nCompany, LLC, (a New Jersey limited liability company), Volosin Holdings, LLC, (a New Jersey limited liability company), NJCB Spec-1, LLC (a New Jersey\nlimited liability company), Port Jervis Holdings, LLC (a New Jersey limited liability company), BONJ Special Properties, LLC (a New Jersey limited liability\ncompany) and BoeFly, Inc. (a New Jersey financial technology company).\nThe Bank is a community-based, full-service New Jersey-chartered commercial bank that was founded in 2005. The Bank operates from its\nheadquarters located at 301 Sylvan Avenue in the Borough of Englewood Cliffs, Bergen County, New Jersey and through its 23 other banking offices.\nSubstantially all loans are secured with various types of collateral, including business assets, consumer assets and commercial/residential real estate. Each\nborrower’s ability to repay its loans is dependent on the conversion of assets, cash flows generated from the borrowers’ business, real estate rental and\nconsumer wages.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Parent Corporation are prepared on an accrual basis and include the accounts of the Parent Corporation and the Company. All\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated from the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSegments\nFASB ASC 28, “Segment Reporting,” requires companies to report certain information about operating segments. The Company is managed as one\nsegment: a community bank. All decisions including but not limited to loan growth, deposit funding, interest rate risk, credit risk and pricing are determined\nafter assessing the effect on the totality of the organization. For example, loan growth is dependent on the ability of the organization to fund this growth through\ndeposits or other borrowings. As a result, the Company is managed as one operating segment.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of condition and that affect the results of operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from those estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to amounts reported in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications had\nno material effect on net income or total stockholders' equity.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 1b. Authoritative Accounting Guidance\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards in 2024\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement\n(Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions” (“ASU 2022-03”). ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual\nrestriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair\nvalue. We adopted ASU 2022-03 on January 1, 2024 and it did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nNewly Issued, But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures. These amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2)\nprovide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5% of\nthe amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The amendments require that all entities disclose on\nan annual basis the following information about income taxes paid: 1) The amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal\n(national), state, and foreign taxes. 2) The amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income\ntaxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amendments also require that all\nentities disclose the following information: 1) Income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign and 2) Income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. ASU 2023-09 is\neffective for the Company beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Business Combination\nOn September 4, 2024, the Parent Corporation and The First of Long Island Corporation (Nasdaq: FLIC) (“First of Long Island”), parent company of\nThe First National Bank of Long Island entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which First of Long Island will merge with and into the Parent\nCorporation, which will be the surviving entity in the transaction. The combined company will operate under the ConnectOne brand, and will have\napproximately $14 billion in total assets, $11 billion in total deposits, and $11 billion in total loans.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, First of Long Island shareholders will receive 0.5175 shares of Parent Corporation common stock for each share of\nFirst of Long Island common stock. The transaction is presently valued at approximately $284 million in aggregate based upon the closing common stock price\nof $23.97 for ConnectOne as of September 4, 2024.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNote 3. Earnings per Common Share\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) No. 260-10-45 addresses whether instruments granted in\nshare-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing\nearnings per share (“EPS”). The restricted stock awards granted by the Company contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered\nparticipating securities. The two-class method for calculating basic EPS excludes dividends paid to participating securities and any undistributed earnings\nattributable to participating securities.\nEarnings per common share have been computed based on the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands, except for per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income available to common stockholders $ 15,652 $ 19,898 $ 48,895 $ 63,203\nEarnings allocated to participating securities (44) (63) (133) (160)\nIncome attributable to common stock $ 15,608 $ 19,835 $ 48,762 $ 63,043\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, including participating securities 38,427 38,817 38,377 39,020\nWeighted average participating securities (108) (123) (104) (99)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 38,319 38,694 38,273 38,921\nIncremental shares from assumed conversions of options, performance units and\nrestricted shares 206 135 185 135\nWeighted average common and equivalent shares outstanding 38,525 38,829 38,458 39,056\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic $ 0.41 $ 0.51 $ 1.27 $ 1.62\nDiluted 0.41 0.51 1.27 1.61\nThere were no antidilutive share equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Investment Securities\nAll of the Company’s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Investment securities\navailable-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders’ equity, net of tax. Accordingly, the carrying value of such\nsecurities reflects their fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Fair value is based upon either quoted market prices, or in certain cases\nwhere there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions are made to determine their fair value.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 4. Investment Securities – (continued)\nThe Company has elected to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost of its investment securities available-for-sale. Accrued interest\nreceivable for investment securities available-for-sale totaled $2.2 million and $2.3 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively.\nThe Company evaluates securities in an unrealized loss position for impairment related to credit losses on at least a quarterly basis. Securities in\nunrealized loss positions are first assessed as to whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before\nrecovery of its amortized cost basis. If one of the criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through current earnings. For\nsecurities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment\nindicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for\ncredit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on asset backed\nsecurities and state and municipal securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality and we do not intend to sell and\nit is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates\nand other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded\nthrough an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. No allowance for credit losses for available-for-\nsale securities was recorded as of September 30, 2024.\nFederal agency obligations, residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities and commercial mortgage-backed pass-through securities are issued\nby U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Although a government guarantee exists on these investments, these entities are not\nlegally backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, and the current support they receive is subject to a cap as part of the agreement entered\ninto in 2008. Nonetheless, at this time we do not foresee any set of circumstances in which the government would not fund its commitments on these\ninvestments as the issuers are an integral part of the U.S. housing market in providing liquidity and stability. Therefore, we concluded that a zero-allowance\napproach for these investment securities is appropriate.\nNote 5. Derivatives\nAs part of our overall asset liability management strategy the Company uses derivative instruments, which can include interest rate swaps, collars,\ncaps, and floors. The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional\namount and the other terms of the individual agreements. Derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and are not reported on\na net basis.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedges\nSubsequent changes in fair value for a hedging instrument that has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship are accounted for in\nthe following manner:\n1) Cash flow hedges: changes in fair value are recognized as a component in other comprehensive income\n2) Fair value hedges: changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings\nAs long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting\ntreatment, 100% of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are accounted for as outlined above. This is the case whether or not economic\nmismatches exist in the hedging relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge\ngains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument that is\nincluded in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is presented in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged\nitem. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was not utilizing fair value hedges.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 5. Derivatives – (continued)\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company during 2021, 2022 and 2024 entered into twelve pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps, with a total notional amount of $550 million. These\nare designated as cash flow hedges of outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We are required to pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 0.63% to\n3.72% and receive variable rates of interest that reset quarterly based on the daily compounding secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). The twelve swaps\ncarry expiration dates ranging from December 2025 to March 2028. The swaps are determined to be fully effective during the period presented and therefore no\namount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swap is recorded in other assets (liabilities) with changes\nin fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to\ncurrent earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully effective during the remaining term of\nthe swaps.\nThe Company previously entered into two forward starting interest rate cap spread transactions, one with a total notional amount of $150 million,\nwhich became effective on October 1, 2022 and which matures in October of 2027 and one interest rate cap spread transaction, with a total notional amount of\n$75 million, which became effective in November 2022 and which matures in November of 2027. These are designated as cash flow hedges of brokered\ncertificates of deposit, and the interest rate cap spread is indexed to a benchmark of fed funds with payment required on a monthly basis. The structure of these\ninstruments is such that the Company entered into a total of $225 million in notional amount of sold interest rate cap agreements, in which we are required to\npay the counterparty an incremental amount if the index rate exceeds a set cap rate. Simultaneously, the Company purchased a total of $225 million notional\namount of interest rate cap agreements in which we receive an incremental amount if the index rate is above a set cap rate. No payments are required if the\nindex rate is at, or below, the cap rate on the sold or purchased interest rate cap agreements.\nNet interest income recorded on these swap and interest rate cap transactions totaled approximately $5.6 million and $16.9 million and $5.5 million\nand $14.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and is recorded as a component of either\ninterest expense on FHLB Advances or on brokered certificates of deposit.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

In addition to its internal monitoring, the\nCompany utilizes the services of a third-party loan review firm to periodically validate the credit quality of its loans receivable on a sample basis. Credit quality\nis monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators. Assets classified “Pass” are deemed to possess average to superior credit quality, requiring no more\nthan normal attention. Assets classified as “Special Mention” have generally acceptable credit quality yet possess higher risk characteristics/circumstances than\nsatisfactory assets. Such conditions include strained liquidity, slow pay, stale financial statements, or other conditions that require more stringent attention from\nthe lending staff. These conditions, if not corrected, may weaken the credit quality or inadequately protect the Company’s credit position at some future date.\nAssets are classified “Substandard” if the asset has a well-defined weakness that requires management’s attention to a greater degree than for loans classified\nspecial mention. Such weakness, if left uncorrected, could possibly result in the compromised ability of the loan to perform to contractual requirements. An\nasset is classified as “Doubtful” if it is inadequately protected by the net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any, that secures the\nobligation. Assets classified as doubtful include assets for which there is a “distinct possibility” that a degree of loss will occur if the inadequacies are not\ncorrected.\n21\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (for\nexample, supported with little or no market activity).\nAn asset’s or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The\nfollowing information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a\nlimited portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates,\ncomparisons between the Company’s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments – (continued)\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nInvestment Securities Available-for-Sale and Equity Securities: Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within\nLevel 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 inputs include securities that have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows.\nExamples of instruments which would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy include municipal bonds and certain agency\ncollateralized mortgage obligations. In certain cases where there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions must be made to\ndetermine the fair value of the instruments and these are classified as Level 3. When measuring fair value, the valuation techniques available under the market\napproach, income approach and/or cost approach are used. The Company’s evaluations are based on market data and the Company employs combinations of\nthese approaches for its valuation methods depending on the asset class.\nDerivatives: The fair value of derivatives is based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (level 2). Our\nderivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are\ndetermined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates,\nprices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rate, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are\nactively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other\nIdentical Observable Significant\nTotal Fair Assets (Level Inputs (Level Unobservable\nValue 1) 2) Inputs (Level 3)\n(dollars in thousands)\nRecurring fair value measurements: Assets\nInvestment securities:\nAvailable-for-sale:\nFederal agency obligations $ 90,810 $ - $ 90,810 $ -\nResidential mortgage pass-through securities 399,235 - 399,235 -\nCommercial mortgage pass-through securities 22,285 - 22,285 -\nObligations of U.S. states and political subdivision 128,307 - 121,305 7,002\nCorporate bonds and notes 5,011 - 5,011 -\nAsset-backed securities 906 - 906 -\nOther securities 159 159 - -\nTotal available-for-sale 646,713 159 639,552 7,002\nEquity securities 20,399 10,068 10,331 -\nDerivatives 29,501 - 29,501 -\nTotal assets $ 696,613 $ 10,227 $ 679,384 $ 7,002\n34\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

These\nadjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets. The\nfollowing methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nLoans Held-for-Sale: Residential mortgage loans, originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, are carried at the lower of aggregate cost\nor estimated fair value as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. For these loans originated and intended for sale, gains and losses on loan\nsales (sale proceeds minus carrying value) are recorded in other income and direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are\nrecognized in other income upon sale of the loan. Management obtains quotes or bids on all or parts of these loans directly from the purchasing financial\ninstitutions (Level 2).\nOther loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value. Fair value of these loans is determined based on the terms\nof the loan, such as interest rate, maturity date, reset term, as well as sales of similar assets (Level 3).\n35\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments – (continued)\nCollateral Dependent Loans: The Company may record adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements, generally as\npartial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of these loans. These adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral dependent loans\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Impairment amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result,\nthe carrying value of the loan less the calculated impairment amount applicable to that loan does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate\ncollateral is valued using independent appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally\nobservable by market participants. However, due to the substantial judgment applied and limited volume of activity as compared to other assets, fair value is\nbased on Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair value used for collateral supporting commercial loans generally are based on assumptions not observable in the\nmarketplace and are also based on Level 3 inputs.\nFor assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as\nfollows:\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant\nIdentical Other Significant\nSeptember 30, Assets (Level Observable Unobservable\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 2024 1) Inputs (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans: (dollars in thousands)\nCommercial $ 741 $ - $ - $ 741\nCommercial real estate 23,136 - - 23,136\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for Significant\nIdentical Other Significant\nDecember 31, Assets (Level Observable Unobservable\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 2023 1) Inputs (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans: (dollars in thousands)\nCommercial $ 657 $ - $ - $ 657\nCommercial real estate 7,005 - - 7,005\nCollateral dependent loans – Collateral dependent loans as of September 30, 2024 that required a valuation allowance were $25.5 million with a\nrelated valuation allowance of $1.6 million compared to $7.7 million with a related valuation allowance of $1.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments – (continued)\nThe fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the\nremaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the\ndifference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of letters of credit and lines of credit are based on fees currently\ncharged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. The fair\nvalue of commitments to originate loans is immaterial and not included in the tables above.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on these estimated fair values.\nThe Company’s remaining assets and liabilities, which are not considered financial instruments, have not been valued differently than has been\ncustomary with historical cost accounting. No disclosure of the relationship value of the Company’s core deposit base is required by FASB ASC 825-10.\nFair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business\nand the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, there are certain significant assets and liabilities that are not\nconsidered financial assets or liabilities, such as deferred taxes, premises and equipment, and goodwill. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the\nrealization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.\nManagement believes that reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely, due to the wide range of permitted valuation\ntechniques and numerous estimates which must be made, given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of\nuniform valuation methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.\nNote 8. Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nTotal comprehensive income (loss) includes all changes in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-\nowner sources. The Company’s other comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized holding gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, unrealized\ngains (losses) on cash flow hedges, obligations for defined benefit pension plan and an adjustment to reflect the curtailment of the Company’s defined benefit\npension plan, each net of taxes.\nThe following table represents the reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nAmounts Reclassified from Amounts Reclassified from\nDetails about Accumulated Other Comprehensive Accumulated Other Comprehensive Accumulated Other Comprehensive Affected Line item in the Consolidated\nIncome Components Income Income Statements of Income\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income on cash flow hedges $ 5,624 $ 4,793 $ 16,936 $ 13,013 Borrowings and deposits expense\n(1,580) (1,442) (4,760) (3,915) Income tax expense\n$ 4,044 $ 3,351 $ 12,176 $ 9,098\nAmortization of pension plan net actuarial losses $ (43) $ (74) $ (129) $ (222) Salaries and employee benefits\n13 22 37 67 Income tax benefit\n$ (30) $ (52) $ (92) $ (155)\nTotal reclassification $ 4,014 $ 3,299 $ 12,084 $ 8,943\n40\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Stock-based Compensation\nThe Company’s stockholders approved the 2017 Equity Compensation Plan (“the Plan”) on May 23, 2017. The Plan eliminates all remaining issuable\nshares under previous plans and is the only outstanding plan as of September 30, 2024. On May 30, 2023, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment\nto the Plan that increased the maximum number of shares issuable to 1,200,000. Grants under the Plan can be in the form of stock options (qualified or non-\nqualified), restricted shares, deferred stock units or performance units. Shares available for grant and issuance under the Plan as of September 30,\n2024 were approximately 336,584. The Company intends to issue all shares under the Plan in the form of newly issued shares.\nAs of both September 30, 2024 and December, 31, 2023, the Company did not have any outstanding stock options. Restricted stock and deferred stock\nunits typically have a three-year vesting period starting one year after the date of grant with one-third vesting each year, with accelerated vesting upon a change\nin control. Restricted stock and deferred stock units granted to new employees and board members may be granted with shorter vesting periods. Grants of\nperformance units typically have a cliff vesting after three years or upon a change of control. All issuances are subject to forfeiture if the recipient is no longer\nemployed prior to the award's vesting. Any forfeitures would result in previously recognized expense being reversed. Restricted stock grants have the same\ndividend and voting rights as common stock, while options, performance units and deferred stock units do not.\nAll awards are issued at the fair value of the underlying shares on the grant date. The Company expenses the cost of the awards, which is determined\nto be the fair market value of the awards at the date of grant, ratably, over the vesting or measurement period. Forfeiture rates are not estimated but are recorded\nas incurred. Stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.1 and $3.2 million respectively. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively.\nActivity in the Company’s restricted stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nNonvested Shares Value\nNonvested as of December 31, 2023 115,805 $ 17.85\nGranted 71,843 18.93\nVested (76,770) 18.42\nForfeited/cancelled/expired (2,638) 18.97\nNonvested as of September 30, 2024 108,240 $ 18.14\n41\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Stock-Based Compensation – (continued)\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $1.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted\nstock granted. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.\nA summary of the status of unearned performance unit awards and the change during the period is presented in the table below:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nUnits (expected) Units (maximum) Value\nUnearned as of December 31, 2023 164,231 $ 23.06\nAwarded 91,691 19.01\nChange in estimate (10,774) 11.93\nVested shares (53,041) 25.24\nForfeited/cancelled/expired (10,260) 23.10\nUnearned as of September 30, 2024 181,847 302,196 $ 21.04\nAs of September 30, 2024, the specific number of shares related to performance units that were expected to vest was 181,847, determined by actual\nperformance in consideration of the established range of the performance targets, which is consistent with the level of expense currently being recognized over\nthe vesting period. Should this expectation change, additional compensation expense could be recorded in future periods or previously recognized expense\ncould be reversed. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of performance units that ultimately could vest if performance targets were exceeded is\n302,196. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 53,041 shares vested. A total of 28,971 shares were netted from the vested shares to satisfy\nemployee tax obligations. The net shares issued from vesting of performance units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 24,070 shares. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compensation cost of approximately $1.8 million related to non-vested performance units not yet recognized is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nA summary of the status of unearned deferred stock units and the changes in deferred stock units during the period is presented in the table below:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nUnits (expected) Value\nUnearned as of December 31, 2023 188,348 $ 22.11\nAwarded 81,736 19.01\nVested shares (80,889) 23.05\nForfeited/cancelled/expired (7,360) 21.53\nUnearned as of September 30, 2024 181,835 $ 20.32\nAny forfeitures would result in previously recognized expense being reversed. A portion of the shares that vest will be netted out to satisfy the tax\nobligations of the recipient. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 80,889 shares vested. A total of 43,347 shares were netted from the vested\nshares to satisfy employee tax obligations. The net shares issued from vesting of deferred stock units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were\n37,542 shares. As of September 30, 2024, compensation cost of approximately $1.6 million related to non-vested deferred stock units, not yet recognized, is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCONNECTONE BANCORP, INC.

Subordinated Debentures\nDuring 2003, the Company formed a statutory business trust, which exists for the exclusive purpose of (i) issuing Trust Securities representing\nundivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest\ndebentures (subordinated debentures) of the Company; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. On December 19, 2003,\nCenter Bancorp Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Corporation issued $5.0 million of MMCapS capital\nsecurities to investors due on January 23, 2034. The capital securities presently qualify as Tier I capital. The trust loaned the proceeds of this offering to the\nCompany and received in exchange $5.2 million of the Parent Corporation’s subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or\nin part prior to maturity. Upon the cessation of publication of LIBOR rates and pursuant to the Federal LIBOR Act and Federal Reserve regulations\nimplementing the Act, the MMCapS capital securities converted effective June 30, 2023 to a new index based on CME Term SOFR, as defined in the LIBOR\nAct, plus a tenor spread adjustment, which is referred to as the Benchmark Replacement. Therefore, effective for quarterly interest rate resets after July 3, 2023\nthe subordinated debentures’ floating rate will be three-month CME Term SOFR plus 2.85% plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%. The rate as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 8.37%. These subordinated debentures and the related income effects are not eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, as\nthe statutory business trust is not consolidated in accordance with FASB ASC 810-10. Distributions on the subordinated debentures owned by the subsidiary\ntrust have been classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities of the Company’s Statutory Trust II as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024\nSecurities Redeemable by Issuer\nIssuance Date Issued Liquidation Value Coupon Rate Maturity Beginning\n$1,000 per Capital Floating 3-month CME Term SOFR + 285 Basis\n12/19/2003 $5,000,000 1/23/2034 1/23/2009\nSecurity Points + 26.161 Basis Points\nAs of December 31, 2023\nSecurities Redeemable by Issuer\nIssuance Date Issued Liquidation Value Coupon Rate Maturity Beginning\n$1,000 per Capital Floating 3-month CME Term SOFR + 285 Basis\n12/19/2003 $5,000,000 1/23/2034 1/23/2009\nSecurity Points+26.161 Basis Points\nOn June 10, 2020, the Parent Corporation issued $75 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the “2020\nNotes”). The 2020 Notes bear interest at 5.75% annually from, and including, the date of initial issuance up to, but excluding, June 15, 2025 or the date of\nearlier redemption, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2020. From and including June 15,\n2025 through maturity or earlier redemption, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to\nbe Three-Month Term SOFR: (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture), plus 560.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15,\nSeptember 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the benchmark rate is less than zero, then\nthe benchmark rate shall be deemed to be zero.\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

The Company’s diluted earnings per share were $0.41 for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the comparable three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The $4.2 million decrease in net\nincome available to common stockholders and the $0.10 decrease in diluted earnings per share were due to a $2.9 million increase in noninterest expenses, a\n$2.3 million increase in provision for credit losses and a $1.5 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in noninterest\nincome and a $1.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Included in noninterest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.7 million\nin merger expenses related to the previously announced, merger with The First of Long Island Corporation. There were no such charges for the three months\nended September 30, 2023.\nNet income available to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $48.9 million compared to $63.2 million for the\ncomparable nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s diluted earnings per share were $1.27 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared with diluted earnings per share of $1.61 for the comparable nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The $14.3 million decrease in net\nincome available to common stockholders and the $0.34 decrease in diluted earnings per share versus the comparable nine-month period ended September 30,\n2023 were due to a $10.7 million decrease in net interest income, a $7.2 million increase in noninterest expenses and a $4.8 million increase in provision for\ncredit losses, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in noninterest income and a $5.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Included in noninterest\nexpenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.7 million in merger expenses related to the previously announced, merger with The First of\nLong Island Corporation. There were no such charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between the interest earned on the portfolio of earning assets (principally loans and investments) and the interest\npaid on deposits and borrowings, which support these assets. Net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis by adjusting tax-exempt income\n(including interest earned on tax-free loans and on obligations of state and local political subdivisions) by the amount of income tax which would have been\npaid had the assets been invested in taxable assets. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of total\naverage interest-earning assets.\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $1.5 million, or 2.4%, from the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from a nine basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.67% from 2.76%, partially offset by\na $13.5 million, or 1.9%, increase in average investment securities. The contraction of the net interest margin was primarily attributable to a 40 basis-point\nincrease in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 24 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $10.6 million, or 5.4%, from the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from an 18 basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.67% from 2.85%, partially offset by\na $72.6 million, or 0.9%, increase in average total loans. The contraction of the net interest margin was primarily attributable to a 69 basis-point increase in the\naverage costs of deposits including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 38 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s average assets, liabilities and\nstockholders’ equity.

Net charge-offs during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 consisted of charges related to five multifamily loans totaling $7.8 million, four commercial loans of $2.2 million and one owner-occupied\ncommercial real estate loan of $0.3 million, while the net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily the result of the\nresolution of certain nonaccrual taxi loans and one owner-occupied commercial real estate loan that was previously reserved for.\nThe level of the allowance for the respective periods of 2024 and 2023 reflects the credit quality within the loan portfolio, loan growth, the changing\ncomposition of the commercial and residential real estate loan portfolios and other related factors. In management’s view, the level of the ACL as of September\n30, 2024 is adequate to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management’s judgment regarding the adequacy of the allowance constitutes a\n“Forward-Looking Statement” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from management’s analysis,\nbased principally upon the factors considered by management in establishing the allowance.\n55\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the ACL on loans are presented in the following table for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nAverage loans receivable $ 8,123,334 $ 8,169,139\nAnalysis of the ACL:\nBalance - beginning of quarter $ 82,077 $ 89,205\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial (1,923) (2,250)\nCommercial real estate (1,636) (237)\nTotal charge-offs (3,559) (2,487)\nRecoveries:\nCommercial 22 -\nCommercial real estate 31 -\nResidential real estate - 1\nConsumer - 7\nTotal recoveries 53 8\nNet charge-offs (3,506) (2,479)\nProvision for credit losses – loans 3,923 1,504\nBalance - end of period $ 82,494 $ 88,230\nRatio of annualized net charge-offs during the period to average loans receivable during the period 0.17% 0.12%\nLoans receivable $ 8,111,976 $ 8,181,109\nACL as a percentage of loans receivable 1.02% 1.08%\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nAverage loans receivable $ 8,222,543 $ 8,142,712\nAnalysis of the ACL:\nBalance - beginning of quarter $ 81,974 $ 90,513\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial (2,223) (6,117)\nCommercial real estate (8,116) (1,954)\nResidential real estate - (18)\nTotal charge-offs (10,339) (8,089)\nRecoveries:\nCommercial 369 9\nCommercial real estate 31 -\nResidential real estate - 69\nConsumer - 7\nTotal recoveries 400 85\nNet charge-offs (9,939) (8,004)\nProvision for credit losses – loans 10,459 5,721\nBalance - end of period $ 82,494 $ 88,230\nRatio of annualized net charge-offs during the period to average loans receivable during the period 0.16% 0.13%\nLoans receivable $ 8,111,976 $ 8,181,109\nACL as a percentage of loans receivable 1.02% 1.08%\n56\nTable of Contents\nAsset Quality\nThe Company manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan portfolio and through review processes that\ninclude analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination of outstanding loans, delinquencies, and potential problem loans, with particular attention to\nportfolio dynamics and mix. The Company strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early on, to record charge-offs promptly based on realistic\nassessments of current collateral values and cash flows, and to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses at all times.\nIt is generally the Company’s policy to discontinue interest accruals once a loan is past due as to interest or principal payments for a period of ninety\ndays. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income.\nPayments received on nonaccrual loans are generally applied against principal. A loan may be restored to an accruing basis when all past due amounts have\nbeen collected. Loans past due 90 days or more which are both well-secured and in the process of collection may remain on an accrual basis.\nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned. Nonaccrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been\nsuspended. In general, it is the policy of management to consider the charge-off of uncollectible amounts of loans at the point they become past due 90 days.\nThe following table sets forth, as of the dates indicated, the amount of the Company’s nonperforming assets:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans $ 51,300 $ 52,524\nOREO - -\nTotal nonperforming assets (1) $ 51,300 $ 52,524\n(1) Nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans and OREO.\nNonaccrual loans to total loans receivable 0.63% 0.63%\nNonperforming assets to total assets 0.53 0.53\n57\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, the principal components of the securities portfolio were federal agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities,\nobligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate bonds and notes, asset-backed securities and equity securities. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, average securities, on an amortized cost basis, increased by $13.5 million to approximately $736.9 million, or 8.0% of average total\ninterest-earning assets, from approximately $723.4 million, or 8.0% of average interest-earning assets, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, average securities, on an amortized cost basis increased by $4.8 million to approximately $732.3 million, or 7.9% of\naverage total interest-earning assets, from approximately $727.5 million, or 7.9% of average interest-earning assets, for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, net unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, which are carried as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss and included in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, amounted to $51.1 million as compared with net unrealized losses of $57.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in unrealized losses is predominately attributable to changes in market conditions and interest rates. Unrealized losses have\nnot been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell, and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the\nsecurities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers\ncontinue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities\nas of September 30, 2024.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nThe principal objective of our asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest-rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts;\ndetermine the level of risk appropriate given our business focus, operating environment, and capital and liquidity requirements; establish prudent asset\nconcentration guidelines; and manage the risk consistent with Board approved guidelines. We seek to reduce the vulnerability of our operations to changes in\ninterest rates, and actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the Bank’s Asset Liability Committee (the “ALCO”). The ALCO generally reviews our\nliquidity, cash flow needs, maturities of investments, deposits and borrowings, and current market conditions and interest rates.\nThe Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk including, but not limited to: (i) balancing the types and structures of interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by diversifying mix, coupons, maturities and/or repricing characteristics, (ii) reducing the overall interest rate\nsensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and/or longer-term deposits; utilizing FHLB advances and wholesale deposits for our interest rate risk profile, (iii)\nmanaging the investment portfolio for liquidity and interest rate risk profile, and (iv) entering into interest rate swap and cap agreements.\nWe currently utilize net interest income simulation and economic value of equity (“EVE”) models to measure the potential impact to the Bank of\nfuture changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the results of the models were within guidelines prescribed by our Board of\nDirectors. If model results were to fall outside prescribed ranges, action, including additional monitoring and reporting to the Board, would be required by the\nALCO and the Bank’s management.\nThe net interest income simulation model attempts to measure the change in net interest income over the next one-year period, and over the next three-\nyear period on a cumulative basis, assuming certain changes in the general level of interest rates. The model also utilizes immediate and parallel shifts in\nmarket interest rates as of September 30, 2024.\nBased on our model, which was run as of September 30, 2024, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous and\nparallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 3.95%, while a 100 basis-point instantaneous and parallel\ndecrease in interest rates would increase net interest income by 1.32%. As of December 31, 2023, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-\npoint instantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 9.25%, while a 100 basis-point\ninstantaneous and parallel decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income by 5.34%.\nBased on our model, which was run as of September 30, 2024, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200 basis-point\ninstantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 1.23%, while a 100 basis-point instantaneous\nand parallel decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 0.07%. As of December 31, 2023, we estimated that over the next three years, on a\ncumulative basis, a 200 basis-point instantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 5.68%,\nwhile a 100 basis-point instantaneous and parallel decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income by 4.29%.\n58\nTable of Contents\nAn economic value of equity (\"EVE\") analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows with instantaneous\nand parallel rate shocks of up 200 basis points and down 100 basis points. The EVE is likely to be different as interest rates change. Our EVE as of September\n30, 2024, would decrease by 9.81% with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of up 200 basis points, and increase by 2.23% with an instantaneous and\nparallel rate shock of down 100 basis points. Our EVE as of December 31, 2023, would decrease by 15.09% with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of up\n200 basis points, and increase by 5.75% with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of down 100 basis-points.\nThe change in interest rate sensitivity was impacted by changes in overall market interest rates, updates to certain model assumptions, changes in short\nand intermediate-term fixed rate funding and by the deposit mix shift into certificates of deposit, from both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing non-\nmaturity deposits.\nThe following table illustrates the most recent results for EVE and one-year NII sensitivity as of September 30, 2024.\nInterest Rates Estimated Estimated Change in EVE Interest Rates Estimated Estimated Change in NII\n(basis points) EVE Amount % (basis points) NII Amount %\n+300 $ 901,295 (161,963) (15.23) 300 $ 241,472 $ (16,904) (6.54)\n+200 958,977 (104,281) (9.81) 200 248,180 (10,196) (3.95)\n+100 1,016,187 (47,071) (4.43) 100 254,797 (3,579) (1.39)\n0 1,063,258 - - 0 258,376 - -\n-100 1,087,007 23,749 2.23 -100 261,791 3,415 1.32\n-200 1,098,261 35,003 3.29 -200 264,101 5,725 2.22\n-300 1,107,465 44,207 4.16 -300 268,546 10,170 3.94\nCertain model limitations are inherent in the methodology used in the EVE and net interest income measurements. The models require the making of\ncertain assumptions which may tend to oversimplify the way actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The models assume that the\ncomposition of the Company’s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured, thus\nthey do not consider the Company’s strategic plans, or any other steps it may take to respond to changes in rates over the forecasted period of time.\nAdditionally, the models assume immediate changes in interest rates, based on yield curves as of a point-in-time, which are reflected in a parallel, instantaneous\nand uniform manner across all yield curves, when in reality changes may rarely be of this nature. The models also utilize data derived from historical\nperformance and as interest rates change the actual performance of loan prepayments, rate sensitivities, and average life assumptions may deviate from\nassumptions utilized in the models and can impact the results. Accordingly, although the above measurements provide an indication of the Company’s interest\nrate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates.\nGiven the nature and speed with which interest rates change, the projections noted above on the Company’s EVE and net interest income can be expected to\ndiffer from actual results.\nEstimates of Fair Value\nThe estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the Company’s assets, including loans held-for-sale and securities available-for-sale. These\nare all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors. Circumstances that\ncould cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds, discount rates, or market interest rates.\nFair values for most available-for-sale securities are based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on\njudgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic condition risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These\nestimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in\nassumptions could significantly affect the estimates.\n59\nTable of Contents\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the\nmeasurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money\nover time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations; unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’s\nassets and liabilities are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates\ndo not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nLiquidity\nManagement actively monitors and manages its liquidity position to determine any current or potential future liquidity needs. Liquidity is a measure of\na bank’s ability to fund loans, withdrawals or maturities of deposits, and other cash outflows in a cost-effective manner. Our principal sources of funds are\ndeposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities of investment securities, and funds provided by operations. While scheduled\nloan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general\ninterest rates, economic conditions and competition.\nLiquidity and funding needs are managed through the Bank's Treasury functions and the Asset Liability Committee. An internal policy addresses\nliquidity and funds management and management monitors the adherence to policy limits to satisfy current and potential future cash flow needs. The policy\nincludes internal limits, deposit concentrations, liquidity sources and availability, stress testing, collateral management, contingency funding plan and other\nqualitative and quantitative metrics.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that, on a short and long-term\nbasis, contractual liabilities, depositors’ withdrawal requirements, and other operational and client credit needs could be satisfied. As of September 30, 2024,\nliquid assets (cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and unencumbered investment securities) were $705.9 million, which represented\n7.3% of total assets and 8.5% of total deposits and borrowings, compared to $516.3 million as of December 31, 2023, which represented 5.2% of total assets\nand 6.1% of total deposits and borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, not included in the above liquid assets were securities with a market value of\n$109.6 million which were pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank, which support aggregate unutilized borrowing capacity of $102.2 million as of September\n30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, not included in the above liquid assets were securities with a market value of $276.0 million which were pledged to either\nthe Federal Reserve Bank’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”), or the Federal Home Loan Bank, which supported aggregate unutilized borrowing\ncapacity of $300.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and, based on available qualified collateral as of September 30, 2024, had the\nability to borrow $2.5 billion. The Bank also has a credit facility established with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for direct discount window\nborrowings based on pledged collateral and had the ability to borrow $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank\nhad in place borrowing capacity of $305 million through correspondent banks and other unsecured borrowing lines. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had\naggregate available and unused credit of approximately $2.9 billion, which represents the aforementioned facilities totaling $4.4 billion net of $1.4 billion in\noutstanding borrowings and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding commitments for the Bank to extend credit were approximately\n$1.1 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $247.2 million as of September 30, 2024, decreasing by $4.5 million from $242.7 million as of December 31,\n2023. Operating activities provided $28.5 million in net cash. Investing activities provided $211.7 million in net cash, primarily reflecting a decrease in loans.\nFinancing activities used $235.6 million in net cash, primarily reflecting $191.5 million in net repayments of FHLB borrowings and a $12.0 million decrease in\ndeposits.\n60\nTable of Contents\nDeposits\nDeposits are our primary source of funds. Noninterest bearing demand deposit products include “Totally Free Checking” and “Simply Better\nChecking” for consumer clients and “Small Business Checking” and “Analysis Checking” for commercial clients. Interest-bearing checking accounts require\nminimum balances for both consumer and commercial clients and include “Consumer Interest Checking” and “Business Interest Checking”. Money market\naccounts consist of products that provide a market rate of interest to depositors. Our savings accounts offer paper and/or electronic statements. Time deposits\n(\"TD\") are for non-retirement and IRA accounts, generally with initial maturities ranging from 31 days to 60 months, and brokered TDs, which we use for asset\nliability management purposes and to supplement other sources of funding. Many of our deposit products can be accessed through both our branches and online\nto provide ease of access to our clients and communities. CDARS/ICS reciprocal deposits are offered based on the Bank’s participation in the IntraFi Network\nLLC (\"the Network\"). Clients, who are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance sensitive, are able to place large dollar deposits with the\nCompany and the Company utilizes CDARS to place those funds into certificates of deposit issued by other banks in the Network. This occurs in increments of\nless than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage in amounts larger than the insured dollar\namount. Unless certain conditions are satisfied, the FDIC considers these funds as brokered deposits for certain reporting requirements. The Bank also utilizes\ninternet listing services deposits which are obtained through the use of websites such as Rateline or QwickRate.\nThe following table sets forth the average balances and weighted average rates of our deposits for the periods indicated.\nQuarter-to-Date Average Quarter-to-Date Average\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance Rate Balance Rate\n(dollars in thousands)\nDemand, noninterest-bearing $ 1,259,912 - $ 1,275,325 -\nDemand, interest-bearing & NOW 3,239,244 3.59% 3,358,834 3.36%\nSavings 508,183 3.39 364,727 2.39\nTime 2,625,329 4.58 2,606,122 3.87\nTotal average deposits $ 7,632,668 3.32% $ 7,605,008 2.92%\nAverage total deposits increased by $27.7 million, or 0.4%, during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The\nincrease in total average deposits was attributed to increases in savings deposits of $143.5 million and time deposits of $19.2 million, partially offset by\ndecreases in interest-bearing demand deposits of $119.6 million and noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $15.4 million.\nThe increase in average time deposits of $19.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 was attributed to increases in retail time deposits of $162.7\nmillion, partially offset by decreases in nonreciprocal brokered time deposits of $70.1 million, CDARs of $63.9 million and internet listing services of $9.5\nmillion. The Bank continues its utilization of nonreciprocal brokered time deposits to enhance balance sheet liquidity as it remains a favorable alternative to\nother borrowings.\nQuarter-to-date average demand deposits have remained relatively stable as an industry trend away from noninterest-bearing accounts and into\ninterest-bearing accounts has largely subsided.\nAverage demand deposits (including interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) for both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023\nincluded $1.2 billion in ICS reciprocal deposits. Average time deposits for the third quarter of 2024 included $66.6 million in CDARS, compared to\n$130.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in CDARS was attributed to maturities that did not renew.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the average balances and weighted average rates of our deposits for the periods indicated.\nYear-to-Date Average September Year-to-Date Average September\n30, 2024 30, 2023\nBalance Rate Balance Rate\n(dollars in thousands)\nDemand, noninterest-bearing $ 1,256,799 - $ 1,360,120 -\nDemand, interest-bearing & NOW 3,244,714 3.60% 3,273,780 3.03%\nSavings 477,037 3.25 367,582 2.20\nTime 2,593,716 4.49 2,541,620 3.50\nTotal average deposits $ 7,572,266 3.29% $ 7,543,102 2.60%\nAverage total deposits increased by $29.2 million, or 0.4%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.

Average time deposits during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 included $73.0 million in CDARS, compared to $117.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in CDARS was attributed to maturities that did not renew.\nThe beta, which is the measurement of deposit rate sensitivity in response to market rate changes, on nonreciprocal brokered deposits tends to be\nhigher than that of ICS and CDARS reciprocal deposits, as nonreciprocal brokered time deposits are more directly correlated to prevailing market rates of\ninterest, while ICS and CDARs reciprocal deposits reflect the Bank’s relationship with reciprocal deposit clients and are more driven by a desire for FDIC\ninsurance coverage than market leading rates.\n62\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth information related to the uninsured deposit balances of the Bank.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance Balance\n(dollars in thousands)\nAs stated in FFIEC 041-Consolidated Report of Condition, schedule RC-O:\nTotal Bank unconsolidated deposits (including affiliate and subsidiary accounts) $ 11,534,113 $ 11,243,254\nEstimated uninsured deposits 6,495,041 6,152,454\nThe Company, on a consolidated basis:\nTotal deposits $ 7,524,105 $ 7,356,202\nEstimated uninsured deposits (excluding affiliate and subsidiary accounts) 2,448,793 2,388,545\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of total actual deposit accounts, by account types for the periods indicated.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmount Percent of total Amount Percent of total\n(dollars in thousands)\nDemand, noninterest-bearing $ 1,262,568 16.8% $ 1,259,364 16.7%\nDemand, interest-bearing & NOW 3,118,844 41.5 3,326,989 44.1\nSavings 528,506 7.0 418,478 5.6\nTime 2,614,187 34.7 2,531,371 33.6\nTotal deposits $ 7,524,105 100.0% $ 7,536,202 100.0%\nTotal deposits decreased by $12.1 million, or 0.2%, to $7.52 billion as of September 30, 2024 from $7.54 billion as of December 31, 2023.

We\nare mailing to our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice of Internet Availability”)\nbeginning on or about April 11, 2024, rather than paper copies of the Proxy Statement, the proxy card and our annual report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Notice of Internet Availability contains instructions on how\nto access the proxy materials, vote and obtain, if desired, a paper copy of the proxy materials.\niii\nThis Proxy Statement is being furnished to shareholders of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) in connection with\nthe solicitation by the Board of Directors of proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held via webcast\nat 9:15 a.m. on May 21, 2024. We are holding our Annual Meeting via webcast. Because the Annual Meeting is virtual via\nlive webcast, shareholders will not be able to attend the Annual Meeting in person but may participate by joining the live\nwebcast. Please go to www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CNOB2024 for instructions on how to participate in the Annual\nMeeting.\nAny shareholder may participate and listen live to the webcast of the Annual Meeting over the Internet at such site.\nShareholders of record as of April 1, 2024 may vote and submit questions either in advance of or while participating in the\nAnnual Meeting via the Internet by using the control number included in the on the proxy statement or proxy card. The\nwebcast starts at 9:15 a.m. We encourage you to access the meeting prior to the start time. If you encounter any difficulties\naccessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be\nposted on the Virtual Shareholder Meeting log-in page.\nWhy have I received these materials?\nThe accompanying proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (referred to throughout this\nProxy Statement as the “Company” or “we”), the holding company for ConnectOne Bank, in connection with our Annual\nMeeting that will take place virtually on May 21, 2024. You are cordially invited to electronically participate in the Annual\nMeeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.\nWho is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?\nHolders of Common Stock as of the close of business on April 1, 2024, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On\nApril 1, 2024, there were outstanding and entitled to vote 38,333,053 shares of Common Stock, each of which is entitled to\none vote with respect to each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting.\n1\nHow do I vote my shares at the Annual Meeting?\nIf you are a “record” shareholder of Common Stock (that is, if you hold Common Stock in your own name as of April 1,\n2024 on the Company’s stock records maintained by our transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.), you may vote\nby proxy or online at the Annual Meeting. To vote by proxy, you may use one of the following methods:\n● Telephone voting, by dialing the toll-free number and following the instructions on your proxy card;\n● Internet voting, by accessing the Internet at the web address stated on the proxy card and following the instructions;\nor\n● Vote by mail, by completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no\nadditional postage if mailed in the United States.\nIf you hold your shares in “street name”, i.e., through a broker or other custodian, you must follow the voting instructions\nprovided to you by your broker or custodian.\nCan I change my vote after I return my proxy card?\nAny shareholder of record has the power to revoke their proxy at any time before it is voted. You may revoke your proxy\nbefore it is voted at the Annual Meeting by:\n● Voting again by telephone or the Internet, or completing a new proxy card with a later date – your latest vote will be\ncounted;\n● Filing with the Secretary of the Company written notice of such revocation; or\n● Participating in the virtual Annual Meeting and voting online during the meeting.\nWhat constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Annual Meeting?\nThe presence at the Annual Meeting online or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding\nshares of Common Stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Proxies marked as\nabstaining (including proxies containing broker non-votes) on any matter to be acted upon by shareholders will be treated as\npresent at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum but will not be counted as votes cast on such matters.\nWhy is it important to vote my shares?\nIf we do not have a quorum present at the Annual Meeting, we will need to adjourn the meeting to solicit additional proxies.\nThis will cause additional expense and delay for the Company.\nWhat vote is required to approve each item?\nPursuant to the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (“NJBCA”), directors are elected by affirmative vote of a plurality of\nthe votes cast. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with the Company’s Bylaws, each of the Company’s directors\nhas submitted an irrevocable resignation from the Board, which shall become effective in the event such director does not\nreceive at least a majority of the votes cast in any uncontested election. In such an event, the director’s resignation will\nbecome effective at the earlier of (i) the selection of a replacement director by the Board of Directors, or (ii) 90 days after\ncertification of such stockholder vote. Accordingly, in the event that a nominee for re-election to the Board receives a\nplurality of the votes cast, but not a majority, he or she shall be re-elected to the Board under the provisions of the NJBCA,\nbut his or her service shall continue only until such resignation becomes effective. Therefore, as a practical matter, re-election\nto a new term on the Board requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.\nEach of the nonbinding resolutions with respect to (i) executive compensation, and (ii) the frequency of shareholder vote on\nexecutive compensation, together with the proposal for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered\npublic accountants, require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by shares represented\nonline or by proxy.\n2\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote my shares?\nUnless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the persons named as proxies on the card will vote in accordance with\nthe recommendations of the Board of Directors. The Board’s recommendation is set forth together with the description of\neach item in this Proxy Statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote:\n● FOR the directors’ nominees to the Board of Directors;\n● FOR approval of the non-binding resolution with respect to executive compensation;\n● FOR a resolution that future shareholder advisory votes regarding compensation paid to the Company’s named\nexecutive officers shall be held every year; and\n● FOR ratification of the appointment of Crowe LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accountants for\nthe fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nWith respect to any other matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote as recommended\nby the Board of Directors or, if no recommendation is given, in their own discretion in the best interests of the Company. On\nthe date this Proxy Statement went to press, the Board of Directors had no knowledge of any business other than that\ndescribed in this proxy statement that would be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting.\nWho will bear the expense of soliciting proxies?\nThe Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to the solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited\npersonally or by telephone, facsimile or electronic transmission by our employees. In addition, we have retained Laurel Hill\nAdvisory Group, LLC at an estimated cost of $6,500 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, including per call fees\nfor each call made, to assist in the solicitation of proxies. We also have agreed to indemnify Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC\nagainst certain liabilities in connection with this proxy solicitation.\nThe Certificate and By-Laws of the Company provide that the number of Directors shall not be less than five or more than 25\nand permit the exact number to be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.\nOur eleven continuing directors and one new nominee have significant and varied operational, financial, risk, technology,\ncompensation and human resources, corporate governance, leadership and other experience, and possess diversity of thought,\ngender and race. Over the past several years, we have enhanced the industry and Company-specific knowledge of our Board\nof Directors with fresh perspectives brought by our new directors. We believe that our directors are active and engaged and\nhave the skills necessary to guide the Company as it grows, as our business strategy and the banking industry around us\ncontinue to evolve and as the financial services sector becomes ever more competitive.\nThe Board continually seeks to refresh and improve its composition and has added new directors both as a result of the\nacquisition of other insured institutions and through searches when it was determined that different skill sets or points of view\nwere needed for the Board. Pursuant to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter as approved by the\nBoard, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “NCG Committee”) is charged with the central role in\nthe process relating to director nominations, including identifying, interviewing and selecting individuals who may be\nnominated for election to the Board of Directors. As part of the Board’s commitment to refreshment, a mandatory retirement\nage of 75 for directors has been adopted.\n3\nWe have had 5 new members join our Board of Directors since 2018. If approved by the shareholders, nominee Susan\nO’Donnell will be the 6th new member to join the Board.\nThe process the NCG Committee follows when it identifies and evaluates individuals to be nominated for election to the\nBoard of Directors is as follows:\nCandidates to serve on the Board will be identified from all available sources, including recommendations made by\nshareholders. The NCG Committee’s charter provides that there will be no differences in the manner in which the NCG\nCommittee evaluates nominees recommended by shareholders and nominees recommended by the NCG Committee or\nmanagement, except that no specific process shall be mandated with respect to the nomination of any individuals who have\npreviously served on the Board. The evaluation process for individuals other than existing board members will include:\n● A review of the information provided to the NCG Committee by the proponent of the candidate;\n● If requested, a review of reference letters from at least two sources determined to be reputable by the NCG\nCommittee; and\n● An interview with the candidate, together with a review of such other information as the NCG Committee shall\ndetermine to be relevant.\nThe NCG Committee, in evaluating potential director candidates, conducts a check of the individual’s background, interviews\nthe candidate, and determines whether the candidate is eligible and qualified for service on the Board of Directors by\nevaluating the candidate under the selection criteria set forth herein.\nThe biography of each of the nominees below contains information regarding the person’s tenure as a director, if an existing\nboard member, business experience, other director positions held currently or at any time during the last five years,\ninformation regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings, if applicable, and the experiences,\nqualifications, attributes or skills that caused the NCG Committee and the Board to determine that the person should serve as\na director for the Company. The Board of Directors has determined that the Board as a whole must have the right diversity\nand complementary mix of characteristics and skills for the optimal functioning of the Board in its oversight of the Company.\nThe Company considers the following requirements for each of its members of the Board:\n● Experience: Current and past work and Board experience; knowledge of the banking industry and financial services\ncompanies; familiarity with the operations of public companies; and business and management experience and\nacumen.\n● Personal characteristics: Ability to work collaboratively with management and as a member of the Board; ability to\nthink strategically and develop a strategic vision or central idea for the Company; familiarity with and participation\nin the local businesses and the communities served by the Bank; integrity, accountability and independence.\n● Director commitment: Time and effort available to devote to being a director; awareness and ongoing education;\nattendance at Board and committee meetings and other Company functions; other board commitments; stock\nownership; changes in professional responsibilities; and length of service.\n● Team and Company considerations: Balancing director contributions; diversity of skills; and financial condition.\n4\nThe NCG Committee and the Board both believe that an effective director evaluation process enables it to gain insights into\nthe effectiveness of the Board, its committees and its individual members, with the goal of continually enhancing Board\nperformance. In this regard, each year the Board, through the NCG Committee conducts an evaluation of the performance,\neffectiveness, and fulfillment of fiduciary duties of the Board as a whole, and of the performance of each member of the\nBoard. The Board evaluation process generally comprises:\n● An annual, overall board evaluation;\n● An annual, individual director evaluation; and\n● A background and skills matrix questionnaire.\nThe evaluation is accomplished through completion of a written questionnaire by each director. The responses are provided to\nthe NCG Committee, on an anonymous basis, and then shared with the full Board, also on an anonymous basis.\nThe Board adopted a skills matrix that represents certain skills that the Board identified as particularly valuable to the\neffective oversight of the Company and execution of its business.

When the Board determines there is a need to fill a director position,\nwe begin to identify qualified individuals for consideration. We seek individuals that possess skill sets that a prospective\ndirector will be required to draw upon in order to contribute to the Board, including professional experience, education, and\nmarket knowledge. While education and skills are important factors, we also consider how candidates will contribute to the\noverall balance of the Board, so that we will benefit from directors with different perspectives, varying viewpoints and wide-\nranging backgrounds and experiences. We view and define diversity in its broadest sense, which includes gender, ethnicity,\neducation, experience and leadership qualities.\nAs part of these efforts to promote corporate social responsibility, the following graphics summarize certain demographic\ncharacteristics of the Board of Directors:\nTotal number of current directors: 12\nPart 1 - Gender Identity Female Male Non-Binary Did Not Disclose Gender\n# of Directors 2 10 0 0\nPart II: Demographic Background\nAfrican American or Black 0 1 0 0\nAlaskan Native or Native American 0 0 0 0\nAsian 0 0 0 0\nHispanic or Latino 0 0 0 0\nNative Hawiian or Pacific Islander 0 0 0 0\nWhite 2 9 0 0\nTwo or more races or ethnicities 0 0 0 0\nLGBTQ+ 0\nDid not disclose demographic backround 0\nIn addition, Board nominee Susan O’Donnell self identifies as female and white.\nFor 2024, there are twelve (12) nominees for Director.

The Company’s policy is\nthat all Directors make every effort to attend each meeting. For the year ended December 31, 2023, each of the Company’s\nDirectors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees on\nwhich the respective Directors served.\nA majority of the Board consists of individuals who are “independent” under the NASDAQ listing standards. In making this\ndetermination the Board has considered the following:\n● The Company and the Bank have used Mr. Kempner’s firm, MWW Group, to provide advertising and public\nrelations assistance and advice. The Board considered, among other factors, the fees paid to MWW Group as a\npercentage of the firm’s total revenue (less than 1%) and Mr. Kempner’s personal income and determined that the\nengagement of MWW Group did not interfere with Mr. Kempner’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out\nthe responsibilities of a director.\n● Several directors, including Messrs. Boswell, Huttle, and Kempner, each own a direct or indirect interest in a limited\nliability company which acts as a landlord for one of the Bank’s branches, See – CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND\nRELATED TRANSACTIONS. The Board has further considered the fact that (i) Director Minoia also owns an\ninterest in an entity which owns the Bank’s Summit branch and (ii) Director Rifkin owns an interest in (x) an entity\nwhich owns the Bank’s Bardonia, New York branch, and (y) an entity which owns the Bank’s Blauvelt, New York\nbranch. The Board has concluded that based on interest in the rental payments compared to their overall net worth\nand cash, membership in such limited liability company does not interfere with their exercise of independent\njudgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\n13\nMr. Sorrentino, who serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Magennis, who serves as Bank President,\nare not independent.

Our Code of Ethics is available on our website\nat https://www.connectonebank.com/ under “About”, then “Investor Relations”, then “Documents and Notifications.”\n14\nOur Board of Directors frequently conducts business through committees. Our most significant committees are the Audit and\nRisk Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee. The table below\nsets forth the membership of these committees during 2023:\nAudit and Nominating and Corporate Governance Compensation\nRisk Committee Committee Committee\nFrank Baier (Chairman) Frank Huttle III (Chairman) Stephen T. Boswell (Chairman)\nStephen T. Boswell Nicholas Minoia Katherin Nukk-Freeman\nFrank Huttle III Katherin Nukk-Freeman William A. Thompson\nNicholas Minoia William A. Thompson\nDaniel Rifkin\n15\nWe maintain an Audit and Risk Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for the\nannual audit and to establish, and oversee the adherence to, a system of internal controls. The Audit and Risk Committee\nreviews and accepts the reports of our independent auditors and regulatory examiners. The Audit and Risk Committee\narranges for an annual audit through its registered independent public accounting firm, evaluates and implements the\nrecommendations of the auditors as well as interim audits performed by our outsourced internal auditors, receives all reports\nof examination by bank regulatory agencies, analyzes such regulatory reports, and reports to the Board the results of its\nanalysis of the regulatory reports. The Audit and Risk Committee met eight (8) times during 2023. The Board of Directors\nhas adopted a written charter for the Audit and Risk Committee which is available on our website at\nhttps://www.connectonebank.com. The Board has determined that Frank W. Baier, the Chairman of the Audit and Risk\nCommittee, qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” under the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission.\nAll members of the Audit and Risk Committee are “independent” under the NASDAQ listing standards, meet the\nindependence standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for service on an audit committee, and are financially literate and can read\nand understand financial statements, as required by the Audit and Risk Committee charter.\nThe Audit and Risk Committee meets periodically to consider the adequacy of the Company’s financial controls and the\nobjectivity of its financial reporting. The Audit and Risk Committee meets with the Company’s independent auditors and the\nCompany’s internal auditors, and the Company’s Chief Auditor, all of whom have unrestricted access to the Audit and Risk\nCommittee.\nIn connection with this year’s financial statements, the Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company’s\naudited financial statements with the Company’s officers and Crowe LLP, our independent auditors. We have discussed with\nCrowe LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, (“Communication with Audit\nCommittees”). We also have received the written disclosures and letters from Crowe LLP required by Independence\nStandards Board Standard No. 1 (“Independence Discussions with Audit Committees”) and have discussed with\nrepresentatives of Crowe LLP their independence.\nBased on these reviews and discussions, the Audit and Risk Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the\naudited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2023 for filing\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Board maintains a Compensation Committee to oversee executive compensation for the Company. During 2023, our\nCompensation Committee consisted of Stephen T. Boswell, Katherin Nukk-Freeman, and William A. Thompson.\nThe Board has defined the duties of its Compensation Committee in a charter. A copy of the current Compensation\nCommittee charter is available on the Company’s website at https://www.connectonebank.com/ under “For Shareholders” and\nthen under “Documents and Notifications.”\n16\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for administering the Company’s equity compensation plans, for establishing\nthe compensation of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and for the Board of Directors, and for\nrecommending to the Board the compensation of the other executive officers. The Compensation Committee also establishes\npolicies and monitors compensation for the Company’s employees in general. While the Compensation Committee may, and\ndoes in fact, delegate authority with respect to the compensation of employees in general, the Compensation Committee\nretains overall supervisory responsibility for employee compensation. With respect to executive compensation, the\nCompensation Committee receives recommendations and information from senior staff members, as well as outside\ncompensation consultants, regarding issues relevant to determinations made by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Sorrentino\nparticipates in Committee deliberations regarding the compensation of other executive officers but does not participate in\ndeliberations regarding his own compensation.\nThe Committee is comprised solely of independent directors.\nThe Compensation Committee recognizes that it is essential to receive objective advice from an outside compensation\nconsultant. Currently, the Compensation Committee utilizes Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (“Meridian”) as its\nindependent compensation consultant. Meridian reports directly to the Compensation Committee and attends meetings as\nrequested. The Compensation Committee has assessed Meridian’s independence relative to the NASDAQ listing rules and\ndetermined that there are no conflicts of interest. The Compensation Committee also closely examines the safeguards and\nsteps Meridian takes to ensure that its executive compensation consulting services are objective. The Compensation\nCommittee takes into consideration that:\n● the Compensation Committee directly hired and has the authority to terminate Meridian’s engagement;\n● the Compensation Committee solely determined the terms and conditions of Meridian’s engagement, including the\nfees charged;\n● Meridian and its consultants have direct access to members of the Compensation Committee during and between\nmeetings;\n● Meridian does not provide any other services to the Company, the Bank, its directors or executives; and\n● interactions between Meridian and its consultants and management generally are limited to discussions on behalf of\nthe Compensation Committee and information presented to the Compensation Committee for approval.\n17\nThe board maintains a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. During 2023 the member of the Committee were\nFrank Huttle, III, Nicholas Minoia, Katherine Nukk- Freeman and William A. Thompson.\nAll members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board have been determined to be\n“independent directors” pursuant to the definition contained in NASDAQ Rule 5605.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter describes procedures for nominations to be submitted by\nshareholders and other third-parties, other than for candidates who have previously served on the Board or who are\nrecommended by the Board. The Company’s bylaws state that a nomination must be delivered to Company’s Corporate\nSecretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the 50th day or no earlier\nthan the close of business on the 75th day prior to the anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however,\nthat if less than 60 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice\nby the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on\nwhich such notice of the date of meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. The public\nannouncement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting will not commence a new time period (or extend any\ntime period) for the giving of a notice as described above. The bylaws require a nomination notice to set forth as to each\nperson whom the proponent proposes to nominate for election as a director: (a) all information relating to such person that is\nrequired to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in\neach case pursuant to Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person’s written\nconsent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director it elected), and (b) information that\nwill enable the Nominating Committee to determine whether the candidate or candidates satisfy the criteria established\npursuant to the charter for director candidates.\nIn connection with the 2024 annual meeting, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee did not receive any\nnominations from any shareholder or group of shareholders that owned more than 5% of common stock for at least one year.\nThere are no compensation committee “interlocks,” which generally means that no executive officer of the Company or the\nBank served as a director or member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers serves\nas a director or member of the Compensation Committee of the Company.\n18\nFrank Sorrentino III, the Company’s President and CEO, also serves as Chairman. The Board believes that the combination\nof these two roles at this time provides the benefit of more consistent communication and coordination throughout the\norganization. This, in turn, will result in a more effective and efficient implementation of corporate strategy and is important\nin unifying the Company’s strategy behind a single vision.\nOur Board has also appointed Mr. Stephen T. Boswell, an independent director, to serve as Lead Independent Director of the\nBoard. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Boswell is charged with presiding over all Board meetings when the Chairman is\nnot present and presides over meetings of the non-management directors held in executive session. The Lead Independent\nDirector has the responsibility of meeting and consulting with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on Board and\ncommittee meeting agendas, acting as a liaison between management and the non-management directors, including\nmaintaining frequent contact with the Chairman and Chief Executive and advising him on the efficiency of the Board\nmeetings, and facilitating teamwork and communication between the non-management directors and management.\nAlthough the NJBCA provides that elections to the Board of Directors are approved under a plurality voting standard, the\nCompany’s has adopted a “majority voting” standard in uncontested elections in its bylaws. Pursuant thereto, each director\nhas delivered to the Board an irrevocable resignation, which shall become effective in the event that, in an uncontested\nelection, such director receives fewer “for” votes than “against” or “withhold” votes. Such resignation shall become effective\nupon (i) the selection of a replacement director, or (ii) 90 days after certification of such stockholder vote. The Board believes\nthat this strategy best places ultimate authority of Board composition in the hands of the Company’s shareholders.\n19\nRisk is an inherent part of the business of banking. Financial risks faced by the Bank include credit risk relating to its loans\nand interest rate risk as it pertains to its entire balance sheet. The Bank is also exposed to non-financial risks relating to its\noperations, personnel, and regulatory environment, as well as extraneous risks surrounding regional and global\nsocioeconomic conditions. The Board of Directors oversees these risks through the adoption of policies and by delegating\noversight to certain committees, such as the Audit and Risk Committee, which is chartered with the responsibility to oversee\nand manage the risk profile of the Bank, and through our Chief Risk Officer. This is accomplished through risk assessments,\nperiodic committee meetings, and reporting from risk owners and control functions. Other committees focus on risks arising\nfrom specific Company activities, including the Loan and Asset/Liability Committee of the Bank. These committees exercise\noversight by establishing a corporate environment that promotes timely and effective disclosure, fiscal accountability and\ncompliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nCybersecurity risk is initially overseen at ConnectOne by the management IT Committee (the “ITC”). The members of this\ncommittee include, as co-chairs, the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Technology Officer. Additional members are our\nInformation Security Officer, IT Manager, Chief Risk Officer, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chief Strategic\nOperations Officer, Chief Digital Officer and Chief Brand and Innovation Officer.\nIn order to ensure that cybersecurity risk management is integrated into the Company’s overall risk management plans,\nsystems and processes, members of the ITC, along with other lines of business heads, report to the management Enterprise\nRisk Management Committee (the “ERMC”), which in turn reports to the Board Audit and Risk Committee quarterly. The\nERMC consists of the Company’s Chief Risk Officer, Chairman & CEO, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Chief\nCompliance Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategic Operations Officer and Chief Credit Officer. In addition, the\nCompany’s Chief Technology Officer attends Company Board of Directors meetings and provides an IT report monthly.\nThe Company’s cybersecurity risk mitigation program involves a combination of internal resources and the use of third\nparties. The Company’s internal IT team performs monthly vulnerability scanning and performs an annual risk assessment\nbased on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. The results are reported to the ITC.\nThe Company’s IT and compliance staff also review potential cybersecurity threats associated with the Company’s third-\nparty vendors, including performing a review of and obtaining a System of Organization Controls report from all vendors\nrated as “high risk” by the Company’s internal vendor management program. The Company also has an internal Incident\nResponse Plan and Team, which is charged with overseeing the Company’s response to any cybersecurity incident. The team\nperforms a table-top exercise at least annually to prepare to respond in the event of any actual cybersecurity incident.\nIn addition to these internal resources, the Company uses a third-party vendor to undertake annual penetration and\nvulnerability testing, with the results reported to the ITC. Finally, the Company’s cybersecurity compliance program is\naudited by the Bank’s outsourced internal auditor annually.\n20\nThe Company considers it inappropriate for any director or officer to enter into speculative transactions in the Company’s\nsecurities to attempt to separate the economic risk of holding the Company’s securities from the ownership of the securities.\nThe Company’s insider trading policy therefore prohibits the purchase or sale of puts, calls, options, or other derivative\nsecurities based on the Company’s securities. This prohibition also includes hedging or monetization transactions, such as\nforward sale contracts, in which the stockholder continues to own the underlying security without all the risks or rewards of\nownership. In addition, the policy prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging Company securities, either as\ncollateral for a loan or otherwise. However, outstanding pledges as of the time the policy was amended to prohibit pledging\n(November 23, 2021) were grandfathered and may remain in place. The prohibitions also do not apply to a broker-assisted\ncashless exercise of stock options granted as part of a Company incentive plan.\nThe Company believes it is both socially important, and good business, to conduct its business in a manner that provides a\nreturn to its shareholders and contributes to the well-being of its customers, employees, and the communities it serves.\nAs part of its commitment to being a good corporate citizen, the Board has charged the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee to oversee the Company’s stewardship and sustainability planning and initiatives. In assigning\noversight of these matters to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board sought to ensure that the\nBoard would have direct involvement and supervision of these matters.\nSet forth below are some representative examples of the Company’s stewardship, citizenship and sustainability efforts so far:\n● We seek to incorporate sustainability into our operations through the procurement of sustainable office supplies. As\npart of our procurement strategy, we purchase SFI certified copy paper and FSC certified paper supplies. We also\nuse copiers and printers that are Energy Star certified and have an ink and toner recycling program.\n● To reduce our energy usage, we have begun retrofitting our branches and offices with LED and other forms of low\nvoltage lighting. As of December 31, 2023, we have retrofitted more than 50% of our branch locations.\n● We provide charging stations for electric vehicles at our corporate headquarters.\n● We encourage employee volunteerism to support causes throughout the Bank’s footprint. In 2023, Bank employees\ndonated nearly 800 hours in volunteer work both through individual and Bank-organized activities.\n● We encourage and support financial literacy programs, providing resources to approximately 33 free/reduced lunch\nschools within our markets. In addition, from 2021 to early 2024, the Bank sponsored financial literacy programs for\n3,464 students within New York, New Jersey, and Florida.\n● We actively contribute to charitable causes in the communities we serve – during 2023 we contributed $442,763 to\n172 different charitable organizations and schools.\n● We maintain clear policies prohibiting discrimination in lending based on gender, race or national origin. Our\nantidiscrimination policies can be found on our website at https://ir.connectonebank.com/.\n● To provide greater access to our services, we provide digital, mobile and online banking services and continue to\nmake investments in these areas to further enhance these services.\n● Our Federal regulators have assigned us a Community Reinvestment Act rating of Satisfactory.\n21\nThe Company believes that creating a positive work environment for its employees is critical to our success and our ability to\nserve our clients and generate a return for our shareholders. We encourage and support the growth and development of our\nemployees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. We have\nformalized our commitment to training, education and mentoring through our ConnectOne University program.\nConnectOne University houses our training, leadership development, continuing education and mentorship programs.\nThrough ConnectOne University, employees:\n● Receive and complete required job training related to their position with the Company, such as compliance training\nand position specific training. Classes include an ABA approved curriculum as well as other third party and\nCompany proprietary courses;\n● May take classes to attain job specific certifications to help with career development;\n● May take continuing education classes related to other positions and operations at the Company;\n● May take business related continuing education classes at partner community colleges and other institutions through\na New Jersey State grant program;\n● May participate in career mentoring programs in which employees meet with senior officers of the Company to\ndiscuss career development; and\n● May participate in a tuition reimbursement program under which the Company will reimburse employees for up to\n$5,250 in tuition expense related to approved business-related course work at any school.\nDuring 2023, 289 employees participated in our leadership and mentoring programs within ConnectOne University.\nThrough ConnectOne University, we also sponsor two employees each year to attend the Stonier Graduate School of\nBanking. This is a competitive process requiring an employee to be nominated by the employee’s manager and then\nparticipate in a panel interview.\n● We offer our employees a full benefits program, including health insurance, flexible spending accounts, a 401(k)\nplan with the Company matching employee contributions up to 5.0% of the employee’s compensation or $16,500,\nwhichever is lower, and an employee discount program under which our employees get discounts at various retailers\nand service providers.\n● We request employee feedback and concerns through our annual Employment Engagement Survey. The results of\nthis survey are presented to our senior management group for the identification of action items to be implemented.\nDuring 2022, approximately 86% of our employees participated in the Engagement Survey, and in 2023\napproximately 91% of our employees participated in the Engagement Survey.\n22\nThe Company strongly believes that having a workforce and Board that is reflective of the communities it serves is an\nimportant way to provide value to its employees, clients, and shareholders. As part of this effort, the Company has taken\nseveral actions to encourage and promote diversity at the Bank:\n● We provide Board oversight of Company policies related to social responsibility issues, including diversity and\nequal opportunity employment, through the Compensation Committee as well as the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee through its oversight of ESG maters.\n● We conduct an annual Employee Engagement Survey to evaluate Bank employees’ opinions on various topics,\nincluding diversity at the Bank.\n● We have adopted policies affirming our commitment to equal opportunity and equal pay and prohibiting\ndiscrimination and harassment. These policies can be found on our website at https://ir.connectonebank.com.\nThe Company recognizes that developing a diverse workplace is an ongoing process that requires broad participation from all\nemployee levels and strongly supports Board, management, and employee involvement for diversity events and initiatives.\n● As discussed above, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has been\nappointed to oversee the Company’s ESG performance and initiatives.\n● We maintain, through an independent third party, a whistleblower hotline that is available seven days a week, 24\nhours a day, and that permits employees to anonymously report concerns and we have policies prohibiting retaliation\nagainst any employee raising a good faith concern.\n● We maintain a detailed code of ethics, which includes provisions on conflicts of interest, and which is available on\nour website at https://ir.connectonebank.com, as well as detailed policies prohibiting money laundering, bribery and\nother corrupt practices.\n● Our Board takes an active role in our cybersecurity risk program, and we maintain a cybersecurity training program\nfor our employees and members of our Board – See “Risk Oversight”.\n23\nThe Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) and the Company are both committed to a pay-for-performance\nphilosophy. This Compensation Discussion & Analysis (“CD&A”) provides information about the strategies and policies\ndeveloped to ensure that executive compensation is strongly correlated with the Company’s overall performance and the\nindividual performance of our executives. Our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”) for 2023 were:\n● Frank Sorrentino III; Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n● William S. Burns: Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n● Elizabeth Magennis: ConnectOne Bank President\n● *Christopher Ewing; Executive Vice President & Chief Operations Officer\n● Mark Zurlini; Executive Vice President & Chief Lending Officer\n● Sharif Alexandre; Executive Vice President & Chief Technology Officer\n*Mr. Ewing resigned from the Company effective January 1, 2024.\n24\n2023 Financial Highlights\nFiscal year 2023 represented a difficult year for the banking industry, as higher interest rates reduced net interest margin and\nnet interest income and the industry addressed the fallout from the failure of several regional banks late in the first quarter of\n2023, putting a premium on liquidity. Despite the challenges faced in 2023, the Company was able to significantly fortify its\nliquidity sources, reduce reliance on uninsured deposits, increase tangible book value per share by more than 6%, build\ncapital, maintain solid credit quality and efficiency, attract new talent to the organization, and continue to invest in technology\ninitiatives.\nDuring 2023, we accomplished the following:\n● Established readily accessible borrowing capacity of $1.8 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank, while increasing\nsimilar capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank by $0.8 billion to help ensure sufficient available liquidity during\npotentially volatile economic periods.\n● Reduced our uninsured deposits by more than $0.7 billion, ending the year with $1.7 billion in adjusted uninsured\ndeposits (total uninsured deposits, net of collateralized and intercompany deposits), and with a ratio of available\nliquidity to adjusted uninsured deposits of 2.47x\n● Despite industry-wide challenges impacting securities portfolio valuations, our tangible book value per share\nincreased by 6.6% to $23.14 at year-end 2023 from $21.71 at year-end 2022, while our tangible common equity\nratio at year-end increased to 9.25% from 9.04% at year-end 2022.\n● Asset quality remained solid; our nonperforming assets ratio was 0.53% at year-end 2023.\n● Total average deposits increased by 11.3% to $7.5 billion, and year-end deposits increased by 2.4% to $7.5 billion.\n● Total average loans increased by 10.8% to $8.2 billion, and year-end loans increased by 3.0% to $8.3 billion.\n● Total operating expense as a percentage of average total assets increased only slightly to 1.48% from 1.44% in 2022,\nbut remained below 1.5%, placing the Company in the top tier in the banking industry.\n2023 Compensation Decisions in Support of our Pay for Performance Philosophy\nOur executive compensation program, practices and pay decisions are designed to be directly aligned with shareholders\nthrough rigorous stock ownership guidelines and equity based long-term incentives. As a result of their ownership, our\nexecutive team is better rewarded when our stockholders see greater returns, and rewarded less when returns are not strong.\n25\nOur Compensation Approach\nOur long-range mission is to produce value for our shareholders by providing outstanding service and responsiveness to the\nmarkets and clients we serve. These goals are reflected in the Company’s compensation programs for its executive officers\nby:\n● Ensuring that our key NEOs maintain and hold a significant equity interest in the Company, thereby further aligning\nmanagement interests with those of its shareholders, by making a significant portion of incentive compensation\npayable in Company stock and through robust stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs;\n● Creating balanced incentives that do not encourage NEOs to expose the Company to inappropriate risks by\nproviding excessive compensation that could lead to material loss;\n● Providing a market competitive overall compensation package so that the Company may attract, retain and reward\nhighly qualified, motivated and productive executives; and\n● Rewarding individuals based on their responsibility and achievements within a framework that is internally\nequitable.\nPerformance-Based Compensation\nPay-for-performance is a key objective of our executive compensation program. A significant portion of our compensation\nprogram focuses on performance-based pay that rewards our achievements on an annual basis as well as our ability to deliver\nlong-term value to our stockholders. We have a balanced approach to total compensation that includes a mix of base/fixed\npay and variable/performance-based pay, a proportion of cash and equity and a proportion of short- and long-term incentive\ncompensation. For the fiscal year 2023, our compensation targets and pay mix (targeting market median) are shown below\nand represent our goal to provide:\n● A significant portion of target pay that is at-risk and based on performance (69% for CEO and 60% for other NEOs);\nand\n● A meaningful portion of pay that is denominated as equity (39% for CEO and 23% for other NEOs).\n● For 2023, 50% of our equity share grants will vest only if predetermined performance goals are achieved. For 2024,\nthis is being increased to 55% for our top three officers.\nCEO Target Pay Mix Other NEOs Target Pay Mix (1)\n(1) Weighted Average of the Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer.\n26\nThe design principles of our executive compensation programs are intended to protect and promote the interests of our\nstockholders. Below we summarize certain practices we have implemented to drive performance and those we have not\nimplemented because we do not believe they would serve our stockholder’s long-term interests.\nWhat We Do:\n● Pay for Performance. We provide a significant portion of pay based on performance (short- and long-term\nincentives).\n● Sound Risk Management. We discourage excessive risk taking and have designed our incentive plans with\nappropriate risk-mitigating features, as well as the ability of the Committee to negatively adjust payouts.\n● Caps on Incentives. We subject both short- and long-term incentive payments to caps.\n● Clawback. We have adopted a clawback policy meeting all updated NASDAQ requirements requiring the return of\nincentive compensation in the event of a financial restatement.\n● Stock Ownership Guidelines. We require our executives and directors to own and hold significant shares in our\nCompany.\n● Double-Trigger Change-in-Control (“CIC”). CIC benefits pursuant to employment or change-in-control\nagreements are only paid upon a termination event following a CIC.\n● Independence. The Committee engages an independent compensation consultant.\n● Competitive Benchmarking. The Committee engages an independent consultant to benchmark our compensation\npractices regularly to ensure executive compensation is consistent with market and best practices.\n● Vesting Requirements. Awards of deferred stock units and performance shares are made subject to vesting\nrequirements, generally three years, to encourage retention of our high performing employees.\nWhat We Don’t Do:\n● Tax Gross-Ups. We do not provide excise tax gross-ups on benefits or in change-in-control agreements.\n● Stock Option Repricing. Our equity plans do not permit repricing of stock options that are out-of-the-money.\n● Excessive Perquisites. We do not permit perquisites other than those that are business-related.\n● Dividends on Unvested Stock Awards. We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned performance\nunits or deferred stock units.\n● Hedging/Pledging. Our insider trading policy prohibits the purchase or sale of puts, calls, options, or other\nderivative securities based on the Company’s securities. This prohibition also includes hedging or monetization\ntransactions, such as forward sale contracts, in which the stockholder continues to own the underlying security\nwithout all the risks or rewards of ownership. The policy also prohibits our directors and executive officers from\npledging Company stock as collateral for a loan or otherwise (although pledges in effect on the date the policy was\namended, November 23, 2021, to prohibit pledging were grandfathered and allowed to remain in place).\n27\nShareholder Engagement\nWe engage with our major institutional shareholders on a variety of topics, including our compensation policies and\nstructures, on an ongoing basis. Our shareholders have overwhelmingly supported our compensation programs and have\napproved our executive compensation every year it has been put to a vote.\nAs a result of lower shareholder support on the Say on Pay proposal last year, we solicited feedback on our compensation\npolicies and programs as part of our outreach program during 2023. We contacted our eighteen (18) largest institutional\nholders, each of which owned between over 6.0% of our outstanding stock to less than 1.0% of our outstanding stock. In the\naggregate, these shareholders held approximately 40% of our outstanding shares. Although a number of the shareholders we\ncontacted did not respond, and others indicated that a meeting was not necessary, we held electronic meetings with all\nshareholders willing to meet with us. Meetings involved both our senior management team and, for those investors interested\nin scheduling an additional, follow-up meeting, the Chairman of our Compensation Committee and our Chief Financial\nOfficer. Our Chairman and CEO did not participate in these second round meetings. The feedback we received on our\ncompensation programs, and the steps we have taken to address these concerns, are summarized below:\nWhat We Heard Steps We Have Taken\nShareholders expressed a preference that Our Compensation Committee has updated our Long Term Incentive Plan,\nmore than a single performance measure starting with 2024 grants, to add a relative total shareholder return modifier to\nbe used to determine the vesting of our determine the vesting of performance unit awards. As the plan has been\nperformance units, and expressed support modified, after determining the performance achievement on Core ROAA\nfor using relative total shareholder return relative to the Performance Index, the payout will be modified based on relative\nas a modifier to determine the percentage total shareholder return positioning versus the same Performance Index. This\nof the award vested. modifier can increase or decrease the award by 25% (e.g., 1.25 or 0.75\nmultiplier) for top or bottom quartile performance.\nShareholders indicated that they believed Our Compensation Committee changed the target allocation of time vested\nthe ratio of time vested awards to awards and performance vested awards for our Chairman and CEO, our\nperformance vested awards should be President and our Chief Financial Officer so that awards are now allocated 55%\nmore heavily weighted toward for performance vested grants and 45% for time vested grants. The Committee\nperformance based awards. maintains the discretion to adjust the time vested awards up or down based on\ncurrent year performance. For 2024 grants, the Committee did not make any\nadjustments to the time-based awards thus maintaining the target mix.\nShareholders suggested that the Chair of Stephen Boswell, the Chair of our Compensation Committee and an\nthe Compensation Committee should independent member of the Board, joined second round meetings with investors\nparticipate in future meetings with regarding compensation policy and issues in 2023 and will participate in\ninvestors meetings with investors with respect to compensation matters going forward.\nAt least one shareholder suggested The Compensation Committee considered this request and determined to\nlengthening the vesting period for equity maintain the 3-year vesting schedule based on market practices. The committee\nawards will continue to evaluate the appropriate vesting schedule for future awards.\nThe results of the shareholder outreach efforts, including concerns and feedback we received, were provided to our board of\ndirectors.\nWe use our executive compensation programs to align the interests of executive officers with our shareholders. Our programs\nare designed to attract, retain and motivate leadership to support our growth and sustain our competitive advantage. Our\ncompensation opportunities are aligned with the competitive market with actual pay that is designed to vary, dependent on\nperformance. We utilize a balance of fixed and variable pay components, cash and equity, and short- and long-term\nperformance horizons to determine our pay. Our compensation program is designed to support our business strategies, align\nour pay with our performance and reinforce sound compensation governance to mitigate excessive risk taking. The below\ngives an overview of the compensation components used in our program and matches each with one or more of the objectives\ndescribed above.\nBase Salary\n● Provides a competitive level of fixed income based on role, experience and individual performance; target market\nmedian.\n28\nAnnual Incentive Plan\n● Motivates and rewards executives for performance on key financial, operational and individual objectives in support\nof our annual business plan and broader corporate strategies.\n● Rewards vary based on performance (higher performance will result in above market median pay; lower\nperformance will result in below market median pay).\nLong-Term Incentive Plan\n● Aligns executives’ interests with those of shareholders through equity-based compensation.\n● Rewards executives for long-term shareholder value creation.\n● Encourages retention through multiple year vesting.\n● Motivates and rewards executives for performance – vesting and value is tied to achievement of specific\nperformance and/or stock price appreciation.\nOther Benefits\n● Provides a base level of competitive benefits for executive talent.\nEmployment Agreements/Severance & CIC Agreements\n● Provides employment security to key executives.\n● Focuses executives on company performance and transactions that are in the best interests of shareholders,\nregardless of the impact such transactions may have on the executive’s employment.\n29\nBase Salary\nThe Compensation Committee reviews salaries each year based on the updated market benchmarking conducted by the\nCommittee’s consultant with the goal of retaining a competitive positioning with the market as the Company continues to\ngrow. The Committee considers the benchmark data provided by its consultant, performance, experience and any unique\ncontributions of the role(s) as appropriate. The table below summarizes the salaries effective as of January 1, 2022 and\nJanuary 1, 2023:\nExecutive 2022 Base Salary 2023 Base Salary % Increase\nFrank Sorrentino III $ 900,000 $ 945,000 5.0%\nWilliam S.

As a result, the peer group analysis\nand competitive benchmarking conducted in November 2022 was used to assess and set 2023 compensation levels. Peer\nbanks consisted of publicly traded Mid-Atlantic, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island bank holding companies with\na total asset range of $5.1 billion to $20.4 billion, that positioned the Company’s assets within a reasonable range of peer\nmedian at the time of selection. Below is a list of the 2023 peer group companies.\n2023 Peer Group\nBrookline Bancorp, Inc. Independent Bank Corp.\nCambridge Bancorp OceanFirst Financial Services, Inc.\nColumbia Financial, Inc. Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation\nCommunity Bank System, Inc. Provident Financial Services, Inc.\nCustomers Bancorp Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc.\nDime Community Bancshares, Inc. The Bancorp, Inc.\nEagle Bancorp, Inc. Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.\nFirst Commonwealth Financial Corporation WSFS Financial Corporation\nFlushing Financial Corporation\n30\nAnnual Incentive\nAn important element of our performance-based pay program is our Executive Annual Incentive Plan, which provides cash\nincentives based on attaining pre-established goals. Each participant has a target incentive opportunity expressed as a\npercentage of base salary, although actual payouts can range from a 50% payout at threshold performance to 150% of target\nfor stretch performance, with no payout below threshold. The 2023 incentive targets are summarized below.\nTarget\nExecutive Incentive\nFrank Sorrentino III 95%\nWilliam S. Burns 65\nElizabeth Magennis 65\nChristopher Ewing 50\nMark Zurlini 35\nSharif Alexandre 35\nThe Compensation Committee establishes performance measures on an annual basis that are tied specifically to the\nCompany’s financial performance (return on average assets, operating efficiency ratio, tangible book value, pre-provision net\nrevenue (“PPNR”) and strategic performance) and individual executive performance. These metrics were selected by the\nCompensation Committee to reflect our profitability, strategic priorities and shareholder value. Further, these metrics were\nreduced from the prior year metric targets in order to reflect the significantly more difficult economic environment the\nCompany faced, including projected increases in the cost of bank funding nation-wide, narrowing of net interest margins,\nreduced market liquidity, and lower loan growth. The weights and performance goals of these factors are summarized in the\nfollowing table:\nThreshold Target Stretch\nPerformance Measure Weight (50%) (100%) (150%)\nCore Return on Assets (\"ROA\") 18.75% 0.60% 0.90% 1.20%\nOperating Efficiency Ratio (1) 18.75 52.5 47.5 42.5\nTangible Book Value Per Share 18.75 $ 22.00 $ 22.75 $ 23.50\nPPNR 18.75 1.25% 1.50% 1.75%\nIndividual Strategic Performance 25.00\n(1) The Operating Efficiency Ratio is calculated as total noninterest expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles, foreclose\nproperty expense and other non-operating expenses, divided by the sum of (i) net interest income, on a fully taxable\nequivalent basis and (ii) noninterest income, excluding securities gains/losses and other nonrecurring items.\nAt the end of the year, the Compensation Committee determined a payout percentage based on an assessment of the\nCompany’s four quantitative financial measures as well as an assessment of each executive’s performance and contribution\ntoward strategic goals. The corporate results, which resulted in an overall below-target payout of 97.9%, were calculated as\nfollows:\n2023\nPerformance Measure Performance Result Payout Result\nCore Return on Assets 0.92% Between Target & Stretch 103%\nOperating Efficiency Ratio 51.50 Between Threshold & Target 60\nTangible Book Value Per Share $ 23.14 Between Target & Stretch 126\nPPNR 1.33% Between Threshold & Target 66\nIndividual Strategic Performance (See Next Paragraph) 125\nIn determining the performance on the individual portion of the annual incentive, the Committee considered its assessment of\nthe Chief Executive Officer’s performance and the Chief Executive Officer’s evaluation of the Named Executive Officers’\nperformance. In light of the Company’s performance in a difficult banking environment and in consideration of the\nsignificant individual and collective achievements of the executive team during 2023, the Committee approved payouts of\n125% of target on the individual strategic performance portion for all Named Executive Officers. The table below\nsummarizes some of the key accomplishments considered by the Committee in determining the individual component.\n31\nNamed Executive Officers & Select 2023 Individual Results\nFrank Sorrentino III\n● Led the Company’s response to the market volatility during the early spring of 2023 related to the failure of several\nlarge regional banks and the industry-wide associated deposit runoff – due to the Company’s customer outreach and\nvarious other strategies to enhance liquidity and Federal deposit insurance coverage for customers the Company\nincurred very little deposit run-off.\n● Managed the Executive Team to provide the leadership required to accomplish the stated goals of Company during a\ndifficult banking environment.\n● Ensured that the Board was well positioned, in terms of information, updates and guidance to exercise its oversight\nof the Company’s reaction to the banking market volatility and its strategic direction, leading numerous special\nmeetings to ensure that the Board was kept up to date.\n● Led Company’s continuing technology development and innovation initiatives to further position the Company as a\ntechnology forward partner.\n● Active engagement with all stakeholders including Institutional Investors, Management, Community and Digital\nusers.\n● Served a critical role as the public face of the Company for client development.\n● Provided active engagement with potential M&A partners.\n● Provided strategic advice to all Board Committees on all topics affecting the Company.\n● Led the Company to one of its best growth years based on metrics, size and capability.\nWilliam S.

In March 2023, the Committee approved a target long-term\nincentive award (split evenly between performance shares and time vested deferred stock).\n2023 LTIP Mix–All NEOs\n33\nTime-vested deferred stock units (“DSU”). Awards have a target opportunity but can be granted based on a lookback on\nperformance and the Compensation Committee’s assessment of factors including the business environment, affordability, and\ncorporate and individual performance. The value of awards granted may vary from 0% – 150% of target for that component,\nbased on the Committee assessment. Once granted, deferred stock vests ratably over a three-year period, and is subject to\nforfeiture if the grantee leaves service prior to the vesting date.\nPerformance-based restricted shares (“Performance shares”). Performance shares are granted at target and earned based\non our future three-year performance for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. The potential number of\nshares that can vest following the three-year performance period range from 0% to 150% of the target levels depending on\nour Core Return on Average Assets (Core ROA) performance relative to an industry index. Core ROA was determined by the\nCompensation Committee to be an effective indicator of the profitability of the Company. Strong Core ROA, over time,\nparticularly relative to industry competitors, enhances the Company’s performance and aligns with shareholder value. As\nused herein, “Core ROA” is defined by S&P Capital IQ as net income, excluding the after-tax effect of realized gains/losses\non securities, nonrecurring items and amortization of intangibles and goodwill divided by average assets. For 2024, this\nprogram has been revised to also consider our total shareholder return relative to an industry index. See “Compensation\nDiscussion & Analysis – Shareholder Engagement”.\nThe Industry Index allows for relative comparison of the Company’s performance to the performance of other banks of\nsimilar size/region during the same three-year performance period. The Industry Index is objectively determined and consists\nof banks in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Region with total assets between $4.5 billion and $25.0 billion, traded on the\nNASDAQ or NYSE exchanges. Performance shares granted prior to 2024 vest after three years based on the Company’s Core\nROA performance relative to the Industry Index banks in accordance with the payout scale below:\n% of Performance\nCNOB Ranking vs. Units Earned\nIndustry Index (2023 - 2025)\n75th percentile and above 150%\n50th percentile 100\n30th percentile 50\nBelow 30th percentile 0\nCommencing in 2024, grants are also subject to a relative total shareholder return modifier to determine the vesting of\nperformance unit awards. After determining the performance achievement on Core ROAA relative to the Performance Index,\nthe payout will be modified based on relative total shareholder return positioning versus the same Performance Index. This\nmodifier can increase or decrease the award by 25% (e.g., 1.25 or 0.75 multiplier) for top or bottom quartile performance.\nBelow is a summary of the 2023 grants:\n● Performance units were granted in March 2023 at target, since vesting is dependent upon actual performance for the\nthree-year period commencing January 1, 2023 and ending December 31, 2025.\n● Deferred Stock Units were granted in March 2023 based on the Compensation Committee’s consideration of 2022\nCompany and individual performance. Considerations in determining the award of deferred stock units included\ncontinued strong profitability and low operating efficiency ratio, and individual performance contributions that\ncollectively resulted in a strong market positioning for the Company going forward. Based on these assessments, the\nCommittee approved grants at a range of 125-150% of target.\nPerformance Units Deferred Stock Units Total\nTarget # Shares Grant Value # Shares Grant Value Grant Value\nFrank Sorrentino III 32,941 $ 590,632 49,411 $ 885,939 $ 1,476,571\nWilliam S.

Based on data reported by S&P Global for the period January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023, the\nCompany’s actual core return on assets of 1.37% ranked at the 83rd percentile (above the 75th percentile payout level)\nresulting in the vesting of 150% of the target performance units.\nRetirement Benefits and Perquisites\nOne of the goals of the Company’s compensation program is to provide limited retirement benefits to our NEOs as an\nadditional retention tool. The Company therefore entered into Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans with Frank\nSorrentino III, William S. Burns, and Elizabeth Magennis, during 2019 and supplemented those plans in 2021. The benefits\nunder each plan differ based upon a number of factors, including, among others, the participant’s age, the reason for any\nseparation from service, and whether the participant has met the vesting requirements set forth in the plan at the time of any\npayment triggering event. In addition, Executives participate in the ConnectOne Bank 401(k) Retirement Plan, which is\noffered to all Bank employees. As stated in the Executive Compensation Objectives and Policies section, the Bank does not\nplace emphasis on perquisites for NEOs, although a car allowance is provided to this group to offset any and all automobile\nexpenses (mileage, tolls, insurance, gas) incurred as part of their job duties.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company is party to employment agreements with several executives. The following is a summary of those agreements.\nMr. Sorrentino’s Employment Agreement\nThe employment agreement with Mr. Sorrentino has an initial three-year term, and will automatically renew for one\nadditional year unless any party provides written notice of its intention not to renew.

Under the terms thereof, if the Company were to\nundergo a “change in control” as defined in the Change in Control Agreement, followed by either (i) involuntary termination\nof Mr. Zurlini’s employment by the Company or the Bank or (ii) voluntary termination of employment by Mr. Zurlini under\ncertain circumstances provided for in the agreement, then Mr. Zurlini would be entitled payment of his then current annual\nsalary (or, if higher, the annual salary in effect on the day prior to the consummation of the Change in Control) plus (ii) the\ntarget bonus potential for the year in which Change in Control occurs, or if not such target has been established, an amount\nequal to thirty percent (30.0%) of his annual salary for the year. Such amount shall be paid within 10 days, subject to\ncompliance with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, after the Company or the Bank receives an executed a general\nrelease of claims in favor of the Company, the Bank, its subsidiaries and affiliates and related parties.\n36\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for discharging the Board’s duties in executive\ncompensation matters and for administering the Company’s incentive and equity-based plans. This includes oversight of the\ntotal compensation programs for the Company’s CEO and other executive officers, including all Named Executive Officers.\nThe Committee is comprised solely of independent directors. The Committee receives input and data from Finance and\nHuman Resources functions as well as outside consultants and advisors to provide external reference and perspective.\nThe Committee reviews all compensation components for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and other executive\nofficers, including base salary, annual incentive, long-term incentives/equity and other benefits and perquisites. The\nCommittee reviews the Chief Executive Officer’s performance annually and makes decisions regarding the Named Executive\nOfficers’ compensation, including base salary, incentives and equity grants based on this review. The Compensation\nCommittee reviews its decisions with the full Board of Directors.\nThe Committee has the sole authority and resources to obtain advice and assistance from internal or external legal, human\nresources, accounting or other advisors, or consultants as it deems desirable or appropriate. The Committee has direct access\nto outside advisors and consultants throughout the year as they relate to executive compensation. The Committee has direct\naccess to and meets periodically with the compensation consultant independently of management.\nThe Compensation Committee retains Meridian Compensation Partners LLC (“Meridian”) as its compensation consultant.\nMeridian reports directly to the Committee and performs no other work for the Company. The Consultant carries out its\nresponsibilities to the Committee as requested by the Committee. The Committee has reviewed and concluded that\nMeridian’s consultation services comply with the standards adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ with respect to\ncompensation advisor independence and conflicts of interest.\nAlthough the Committee makes independent determinations on all matters related to compensation of the Named Executive\nOfficers, certain members of management may be requested to attend or provide input to the Committee. Input may be sought\nfrom the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or others to ensure the Committee has the information and\nperspective it needs to carry out its duties.\nIn particular, the Committee seeks input from the Chief Executive Officer on matters relating to strategic objectives,\nCompany performance goals and input on his assessment of the Named Executive Officers, including contribution and\nindividual performance of each of his direct reports. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer often assist\nthe Committee on matters of design, administration and operation of the Company’s compensation programs.\nAlthough executives may provide insight, suggestions or recommendations regarding executive compensation, they are not\npresent during the Compensation Committee’s deliberations or vote. Only Compensation Committee members vote on\ndecisions regarding executive compensation. The Committee regularly meets in executive session without management\npresent. While the Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations on other Named Executive Officers, the Committee is\nultimately responsible for approving compensation for all Named Executive Officers. The Chief Executive Officer’s\ncompensation is discussed in executive session without members of management, including the Chief Executive Officer,\npresent.\n37\nAs a matter of sound governance, we follow certain practices with respect to our compensation program. We regularly review\nand evaluate our compensation practices in light of regulatory developments, market standards and other considerations.\nOur insider trading policy prohibits the purchase or sale of puts, calls, options, or other derivative securities based on the\nCompany’s securities. This prohibition also includes hedging or monetization transactions, such as forward sale contracts, in\nwhich the stockholder continues to own the underlying security without all the risks or rewards of ownership. The policy also\nprohibits directors and executive officers from pledging the Company’s securities as collateral for a loan or otherwise\n(although pledges outstanding as of the date the policy was amended to prohibit pledging (November 23, 2021) are allowed\nto remain in effect).\nThe Company has a Compensation Recoupment Policy requiring the return of incentive compensation in the event of a\nfinancial restatement. Specifically, if the Company restates its financial statements, then, to the fullest extent permitted by\nlaw, the Company shall require each current or former executive officer, to reimburse such compensation that would have\nbeen in excess of that which would have been paid based to him or her upon the financial statements as so restated. A copy of\nour Compensation Recoupment policy is available on our website at https://ir.connectonebank.com/.\nThe Compensation Committee has a stock ownership policy that requires officers with the title Executive Vice President and\nabove, together with members of the Board, to own a significant amount of the Company’s stock. Specific guidelines are:\n● Six (6) times the then annual base salary for the Chief Executive Officer\n● Three (3) times the then annual base salary for the Bank President and the Senior Executive Vice President, Chief\nFinancial Officer\n● Two (2) times the then annual base salary for other Executive Vice Presidents\n● Directors, other than the CEO and Bank President, are expected to achieve ownership equal to five (5) times the sum\nof (i) the then-current annual cash retainer and (ii) the then-current value of the annual equity award.\nThe period to achieve compliance is five (5) years from the day the individual becomes subject to the policy. The\nCompensation Committee monitors ownership levels and compliance on an annual basis. Below is a summary of shares that\nqualify for the ownership requirements described above (unexercised stock options and unvested performance shares are\nexcluded):\n● Beneficially owned shares that the individual owns or has voting power over, including the power to vote (including\nrestricted shares), or to direct the voting; and/or, investment power including the power to dispose or to direct the\ndisposition.\n● Shares owned by an individual in the Company’s benefit plans (e.g., 401(k)).\nThe Compensation Committee evaluates compliance with our stock ownership policy annually, and has determined that at\nyear-end 2023, all of our executive officers were in compliance.\n38\nThe Committee reviews the structure and components of our compensation arrangements, the material potential sources of\nrisk in our business lines and compensation arrangements, and various policies and practices of the Company that mitigate\nthis risk. Within this framework, the Committee discusses the parameters of acceptable and excessive risk-taking and the\ngeneral business goals and concerns of the Company. In particular, the Committee focuses on the risks associated with the\ndesign of each plan, the mitigation factors that exist for each plan, additional factors that could be considered and an overall\nrisk assessment with respect to the plans. All of our plans have links to corporate or business line results that allow for\nfunding to be adjusted downward, awards are capped, and our governance procedures ensure awards are reviewed for\nappropriateness before they are distributed.\nWe have determined our executive and employee incentive compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material\nadverse effect on the Company. Further, it is both the Committee’s and management’s intent to continue to evolve our\nprocesses going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation.\nThe accounting and tax treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of\ncompensation for our executive officers. However, the Compensation Committee and management have considered the\naccounting and tax impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit to the\nexecutive.\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or CD&A, contained\nin this proxy statement with management. Based on the Compensation Committee’s review of and discussion with\nmanagement with respect to the CD&A, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors of the\nCompany that the CD&A be included in this proxy statement and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\nThe foregoing report is provided by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors:\nCompensation Committee\nStephen T.

The peer group used for\nthis purpose is the Company’s peer group as defined in the section captioned “EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION –\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis.” The same financial services holding companies were included in the\nCompany’s Compensation Peer Group disclosed in the section captioned “EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION –\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis” in the Company’s Proxy Statement for each of the 2022 Annual Meeting\nand the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n(7) The dollar amounts reported represent the amount of net income (in thousands) reflected in the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements for the applicable year.\n(8) While the Company uses numerous financial and non-financial performance measures for the purpose of evaluating\nperformance for the Company’s compensation programs, we have determined that Core Return on Average Assets\n(“Core ROAA”) is the financial performance measure that, in Company's opinion, represents the most important\nperformance measure (that is not otherwise required to be disclosed in this table) we used to link compensation\nactually paid to the Company’s NEOs for the most recently completed fiscal year to the Company's\nperformance. Core ROAA is defined as core income as a percentage of average assets. Core income is defined as net\nincome after taxes and before extraordinary items, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, gain on\nsale of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities, amortization of intangibles, goodwill and nonrecurring\nitems. Examples of nonrecurring items include, but are not limited to, merger charges, loss on debt extinguishment,\nand gains on sales of branches. Our Compensation Committee believes Core ROAA is the most comprehensive and\nconsistent measure of profitability and the least likely to be impacted by items that can conflict with optimal\nperformance. Set forth below are the most important financial performance measures we used to link compensation\nactually paid to the CEO and Other NEOs to our performance for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n● Core ROAA\n● Efficiency Ratio\n● Attainment of a target tangible book value per share.\nCompensation Actually Paid Versus Company Performance\nThe following charts provide a clear, visual depiction of the relationships between CAP for our CEO and the average CAP for\nour Other NEOs, to aspects of the Company’s financial performance.\nCEO and Average Other NEOs CEO and Average Other NEOs\nCAP vs. Company TSR and Peer Group TSR CAP vs. GAAP Net Income\nCEO and Average Other NEOs\nCAP vs. Core ROAA %\n46\nThe following table represents the grants of awards to the Named Executive Officers in 2023:\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards\nEstimated future payouts under non-equity Estimated future payouts under equity\nincentive plan awards incentive plan awards\nAll other stock\nAll other stock awards: Grant date fair\nawards: Number of Exercise or value of stock\nNumber of securities base price of and option\nGrant Threshold Target Maximum Threshold Target Maximum shares of stock underlying option awards awards\nName (a) Date (b) ($) (c) ($) (d) ($) (e) (#) (f) (#) (g) (#) (h) or units (#) (i) options (#) (j) ($/share) (k) ($) (l)\nFrank Sorrentino III 3/20/2023 16,471 32,941 49,412 49,411 $ 1,476,571\nWilliam S.

Mr. Rifkin owns\napproximately 50% of the membership interests in this limited liability company, and does not serve as its managing member.\nThe lease for the Blauvelt branch has a term ending on February 28, 2028. The rent paid by the Bank in 2023 was $111,362\nwith increases as set forth in the lease.\n51\nUnder Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, companies with securities registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act are required to provide shareholders the opportunity\nto vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of executives. The Company has determined to\nimplement this requirement by providing shareholders with a simple vote that indicates their position (by a yes or no vote)\nwith respect to our executive compensation.\nAlthough as a policy we attempt to maintain an ongoing dialogue with our shareholders, in connection with and as a result of\nthe 2023 “say on pay” negative recommendation by a proxy advisory firm and the shareholder “say on pay” vote (which was\napproved by the vote of 65.6% of the shares voting), we specifically engaged with our institutional shareholders regarding\nour compensation practices. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Shareholder Engagement.”\nOur Board of Directors annually reviews and approves corporate and/or individual goals and objectives relevant to the\ncompensation of our executive officers, evaluates performance in light of those goals and objectives, and determines\ncompensation levels based on this evaluation, as described elsewhere in this proxy statement. In determining any long-term\nincentive component of compensation, the Board will consider all such factors as it deems relevant, such as performance and\nrelative shareholder return, the value of similar incentive awards at comparable companies and the awards granted in\nprevious years. We also believe that both the Company and shareholders benefit from these compensation policies.\nThe Board recommends that shareholders approve, in an advisory vote, the following resolution:\n“Resolved, that the shareholders approve the executive compensation of the Company, as described in this proxy\nstatement, including the tabular disclosure regarding executive officers in this Proxy Statement.”\nBecause your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board will take into account the outcome\nof the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.\nRECOMMENDATION\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS\nVOTE “FOR” THE ADVISORY PROPOSAL SET FORTH ABOVE.\n52\nAs described in Proposal 2 above, the Company’s shareholders are being provided the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to\napprove the Company’s executive compensation. The advisory vote on executive compensation described in Proposal 2\nabove is referred to as a “Say-on-Pay” vote. This Proposal 3 affords shareholders the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on\nhow often the Company should include a Say-on-Pay vote in its proxy materials in the future. Under this Proposal 3,\nshareholders may vote to have the Say-on-Pay vote every year, every two years or every three years.\nThe Board of Directors believes that its Say-on-Pay vote should be conducted every year. In 2018, the previous time that the\nCompany held a vote with respect to the frequency of its Say-on-Pay vote, shareholders advised the Company to hold a vote\nevery year. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee continue to believe that shareholders should have a\nSay-on-Pay vote annually. The Compensation Committee, which administers the executive compensation program, values the\nopinions expressed by shareholders in these votes, and even though non-binding, will continue to consider the outcome of\nthese votes in making its decisions on executive compensation.\nThe Board of Directors believes an advisory vote to approve our executive officer compensation should occur every year and\nrecommends a vote FOR the following resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that future shareholder advisory votes regarding the compensation paid to the Company’s\nnamed executive officers shall be held every year.”\nVOTE REQUIRED; EFFECT\nWith respect to Proposal 3, the option of one year, two years or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast will\nbe the frequency of the vote on the compensation of our named executive officers that has been approved by the shareholders\non an advisory basis. With respect to Proposal 3, only those votes cast (for annual votes, votes every two years or votes every\nthree years) will be included. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted only for the purpose of determining whether\na quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.\nBecause this shareholder vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Board will take\ninto account the outcome of the vote. As indicated above, the Board is recommending that shareholders vote for an advisory\nvote to approve executive compensation every year.\nRECOMMENDATION\nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote “FOR” an annual Say-on-Pay vote.\n53\nThe Audit and Risk Committee has appointed the firm of Crowe LLP to act as our independent registered public accounting\nfirm and to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. This appointment will\ncontinue at the pleasure of the Audit and Risk Committee and is presented to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of\ngood governance. In the event that this appointment is not ratified by our shareholders, the Audit and Risk Committee will\nconsider that fact when it selects independent auditors for the following fiscal year.\nCrowe LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since July 1, 2014, and one or more\nrepresentatives of Crowe LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting. These representatives will be provided with an\nopportunity to make a statement at the Annual Meeting if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate\nquestions from shareholders.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the fees billed or expected to be billed to the Company by Crowe for\nprofessional services rendered for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAggregate fees billed to the company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 by the Company’s principal\naccounting firm are shown in the following table:\nFiscal Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees $804,000 $773,000\nAudit Related Fees - -\nTax Fees (1) 54,679 19,883\nOther Fees 52,932 31,210\nTotal Fees $911,611 $824,093\n(1) Consists of tax filing and tax related compliance and other advisory services.\nTHE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY THE SELECTION OF CROWE LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE 2024 FISCAL YEAR REQUIRES AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE\nMAJORITY OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED ONLINE OR BY PROXY AT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND\nENTITLED TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSAL.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE\nRATIFICATION OF CROWE LLP AS THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\n54\nProposals of shareholders to be included in the Company’s 2025 proxy material must be received by the secretary of the\nCompany no later than January 21, 2025.\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company’s officers and directors, and persons who own\nmore than ten percent of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in\nownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are\nrequired by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a)\nforms they file. The Company believes that all persons associated with the Company and subject to Section 16(a) have made\nall required filings on a timely basis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except for each of Frank Sorrentino III,\nWilliam S. Burns, Elizabeth Magennis, Christopher Ewing, and Laura Criscone; four transactions occurring on March 20,\n2023, and one transaction occurring on March 23, 2023 (the “Delinquent Reports”). Each of the foregoing is related to\nnetting transactions for tax withholding in connection with the vesting of restricted stock granted in prior years. Each of the\nDelinquent Reports results from a delay in the calculations of the number of shares to be netted out.\nThe Board of Directors is not aware of any other matters which may come before the Annual Meeting. However, in the event\nsuch other matters come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote on any such matters\nin accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors.\n55"
