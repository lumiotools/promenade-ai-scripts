Provides Updates on Efforts to Achieve Fair Market Access for its Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS®) Device\n\nNovember 18, 2024 at 8:01 AM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/11156/pdf)\n\n### Management to host business update call today at 9:00am ET\n\nNEWTOWN, Pa., Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:HSDT) (“Helius” or the “Company”), a neurotech company focused on delivering a novel therapeutic neuromodulation approach for balance and gait deficits, today provided updates on its efforts to achieve fair market access for its Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS) device and announced plans to host a business update call today at 9:00am ET. \n\n“We disagree with the proposed pricing for the PoNS Mouthpiece and are disappointed CMS has once again mapped the Controller pricing to a code for fundamentally different technology,” said Dane Andreeff, Helius’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “In the face of this challenge our team’s response has been impressive as we continue to pursue fair market access for Medicare’s Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients with balance and gait deficit. At the November 8th HCPCS Level 2 Public meeting we again refuted CMS’ methodology and presented compelling evidence in support of fair pricing for the PoNS device. Our diligent response and extensive evidence, outlined here today, has been successfully understood by the VA and a private payor. We are hopeful CMS can reach the same conclusions, and we will continue to support their reassessment.”\n\n**Recent Reimbursement Updates**\n\n  * CMS issued pricing determinations for both the PoNS Controller and Mouthpiece that the Company believes reflect incomplete information and erroneous assessments of the technology, which currently preclude market access to PoNS device prescriptions for Medicare’s (MS) patients with balance and gait deficits \n    * Mouthpiece pricing to take effect January 1, 2025 does not reflect recent market pricing in the gap-filling analysis. Helius has requested a meeting with CMS to occur prior to the effective date in an attempt to correct the pricing\n    * Proposed Controller pricing incorrectly maps to a TENS device code as PoNS does not involve peripheral stimulation, and acts through neural plasticity and therefore is not grounded on the gate control theory of pain\n    * Timing for the pricing determination and reimbursement implementation of the Controller on April 1st, three months after the Mouthpiece, an accessory required for use of the device. Helius plans to request the Controller pricing to be set in tandem with the Mouthpiece on January 1st\n  * Enduring a third review cycle for PoNS Controller pricing and the uncertain timeline has delayed access to PoNS Therapy® for qualified MS patients and delayed Helius’ commercial launch\n  * Process has impacted the Company’s market value and impeded its ability to access public markets to finance its operations thus leading to the pursuit of strategic alternatives\n\n\n\n**Business Update Call**\n\nHelius management plans to host a conference call to discuss recent business updates and its efforts to achieve fair market access for the PoNS device at 9:00am ET today, November 18, 2024.

(Nasdaq:HSDT) (“Helius” or the “Company”), a neurotech company focused on delivering a novel therapeutic neuromodulation approach for balance and gait deficits, today announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) posted final Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies fee schedule payment rates for the PoNS Mouthpiece (HCPCS code A4594) at $2,963.30 to be implemented January 1, 2025 and deferred final national determination of the payment rate for the PoNS Controller (HCPCS Code A4593) to the next payment cycle.\n\n“We strongly disagree with CMS’ methods, rationale, pricing and deferral for determining the payment rates for both the PoNS Mouthpiece and the PoNS Controller. Helius has spent millions of dollars in R&D to develop technology that the FDA designated a Breakthrough Device and cleared nearly four years ago. Further, the clinical and recent claims data supports fair pricing levels that would provide value for all stakeholders. This evidence will again soon be presented to CMS in efforts to establish appropriate pricing that would facilitate market access for the millions of MS patients who continue to suffer from gait deficit without the potential benefit of PoNS. We are hopeful that we will be able to finalize fair reimbursement for the PoNS Mouthpiece and Controller with CMS in the near future,” commented Helius’ President and Chief Executive Officer, Dane Andreeff. “We believe that increased patient access to our PoNS technology will support revenue growth and as we scale, we intend to establish a pathway to positive cash flow generation as we continue pursuing authorization for stroke in the U.S.”\n\nCMS has corrected the reimbursement for the PoNS Mouthpiece as an essential accessory for which payment is made on a lump sum basis, as opposed to the preliminary determination of making monthly rental payments. The methodology used for setting the price remained the gap filling approach.\n\n“We are pleased with the progress in correctly classifying the mouthpiece as an accessory and with using the gap filling approach, but we disagree with the use of prior temporary introductory pricing, discontinued early this year, in determination of the starting point. The temporary introductory pricing was offered in an attempt to make PoNS accessible to patients on a cash pay basis while we pursued reimbursement. However, it does not reflect current market pricing as it is substantially below the contracted prices with the VA, DoD and GSA and paid by a major insurance carrier,” continued Andreeff. “We will be approaching CMS prior to the CMS pricing taking effect on January 1, 2025 to request that they revisit the starting point for the gap filling process to more appropriately use the market pricing established through negotiation with the VA and an insurance carrier.”\n\nAs also published on October 7, 2024, CMS elected to defer final determination of reimbursement for the PoNS Controller until the next payment cycle due to “more time needed to evaluate this complex issue.” Subsequently, on October 8, 2024, CMS published the preliminary rate of reimbursement for the PoNS Controller at the capped total payment of $519.80, based on its view that the product is comparable to devices reported with HCPCS code E0730 (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device, four or more leads, for multiple nerve stimulation). This preliminary decision will be discussed at the HCPCS public meeting on November 8, 2024.\n\nCMS previously made a preliminary determination that the PoNS Controller rate of reimbursement should be determined by reference to a different code, HCPCS code E0745, (Neuromuscular stimulator, electronic shock unit) in May 2024. Helius successfully rebutted this determination in the May 2024 public meeting and subsequent communications with CMS, resulting in CMS agreeing with the Company by not finalizing a payment rate based on HCPCS code E0745. Andreeff added “Now, under the new preliminary decision, CMS has pivoted to improperly find the PoNS Controller to be comparable to a TENS device.”\n\n“We will again present the differences between the PoNS Controller from other devices, this time the TENS devices, in the upcoming public meeting and communications with CMS. We remain hopeful that CMS will properly set pricing for the PoNS Controller using the gap filling methodology that works off the government contract and insurance pricing,” concluded Andreeff.\n\n**About Helius Medical Technologies, Inc.**\n\nHelius Medical Technologies is a leading neurotech company in the medical device field focused on neurologic deficits using orally applied technology platform that amplifies the brain’s ability to engage physiologic compensatory mechanisms and promote neuroplasticity, improving the lives of people dealing with neurologic diseases.

Announces Positive Preliminary Results of the PoNSTEP Study\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 at 8:00 AM EDT\n\n[PDF Version](/node/11101/pdf)\n\n_-- Achieves primary endpoint showing a linear relationship between adherence to PoNS Therapy ® in Phase 2 and improvement in DGI scores from Phase 1 to end of treatment at week 14 --_\n\n_-- Confirms the therapeutic benefits of PoNS Therapy for gait deficit improvement in people with MS --_\n\nNEWTOWN, Pa., Sept. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:HSDT) (“Helius” or the “Company”), a neurotech company focused on delivering a novel therapeutic neuromodulation approach for balance and gait deficits, today announced positive preliminary results from its Therapeutic Experience Program open-label observational study (PoNSTEP) which evaluates the impact of subjects’ adherence to the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS®) Therapy program that treat gait deficit due to multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The study treatment phase is complete, and the ongoing post-treatment follow-up phase will be completed by the end of the year, with full results expected to be released in early 2025.\n\n“As physicians, we often face challenges with patients embracing the importance of fully complying with their rehabilitation program” said Antonella Favit-Van Pelt, M.D., Ph.D., Helius' Chief Medical Officer, “The PoNSTEP study provides compelling evidence on how, with any self-directed at home physical therapy activity, adherence can significantly determine how much functional improvement any patient can achieve”. We are encouraged to see the meaningful gait deficit improvements in patients who were consistently compliant with their therapy regimen.”\n\n**Preliminary PoNSTEP Results**\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is aimed at demonstrating improvement in DGI from end of the 2-week supervised in-clinic treatment phase (Phase 1) to end of the 12-week at-home, unsupervised treatment phase (Phase 2), relative to subjects’ adherence to PoNS device utilization in their weekly PoNS therapy program (PoNS Therapy). Forty-three subjects with gait deficit due to symptoms from multiple sclerosis were enrolled with 41 participants starting the study treatment and 38 participants completing the 14-week study treatment period who are currently undergoing post treatment follow-up (Phase 3).\n\nPoNSTEP met the primary endpoint, showing statistically significant mean improvement in DGI during Phase 2 and a linear relationship between PoNS Therapy adherence and improvement in DGI scores from end of Phase 1 to end of treatment at week 14:\n\n  * In Phase 1, the average therapy adherence was almost 90% with a mean improvement of 2.5 points in DGI scores from baseline to the end of week 2 without, however, a clear correlation between adherence and DGI improvement (N=41, r=-0.03; p=0.83).\n  * In Phase 2, the average therapy adherence was 67% with a mean incremental improvement, at week 14, of an additional 2.8 points in DGI scores from the improvement achieved at the end of Phase 1 (paired t-test p<0.0001). In contrast to Phase 1, improvement in Phase 2 DGI was significantly moderated by PoNS adherence (N=38, r=0.345; p=0.034).\n\n\n\nOver the course of the 14-week treatment (Phase 1 and Phase 2), the average therapy adherence met or exceeded 70% of the recommended, on label, PoNS Therapy utilization and led to a mean improvement of 5.0 points (p<0.0001) in DGI from baseline to the end of the 14-week treatment period moderated by adherence (r=0.34; p<0.0001). Among 23 participants who met or exceeded 70% therapy adherence, more than 65% experienced a cumulative mean DGI improvement of at least 5 points and approximately 74% gained at least 4-point improvement from baseline to end of treatment.\n\n“This data is expected to confirm the importance of the at-home rehabilitation part of PoNS Therapy, following the supervised in-clinic treatment, in achieving optimal gait deficit improvement results,” said Dr. Salvatore Napoli, MD, Medical Director, Neurology Center of New England. “We are also encouraged to see the high compliance rates across patients which is likely supported by the user friendly and straight forward application of PoNS Therapy.”\n\nThe preliminary descriptive analysis of the active treatment data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 demonstrates that, overall, 66% of participants gained a clinically meaningful improvement of at least 4 points in the DGI assessment over the course of the therapy. In addition, 71% of participants gained at least a 2-point improvement in DGI in the first 2 weeks of in-clinic treatment (Phase 1) and 68 % had an incremental DGI improvement of at least 2 points over the course of the remaining 12 weeks of at-home therapy. In line with the clinical evidence from PoNS clinical studies and real-world utilization data, 50% of participants who used PoNS Therapy for the recommended 100-120 min/day, equivalent to 85% and 100% therapy adherence respectively, achieved over a 6-point improvement in DGI from baseline over 14 weeks of treatment.\n\nDr. Favit-Van Pelt added, “The study’s preliminary results provide material confirmatory evidence of the therapeutic benefits of PoNS Therapy for gait deficit improvement in people with MS and strengthen the body of clinical evidence pointing to the importance of utilizing the therapy at the recommended dose regularly and consistently. The study preliminary results also highlight the importance of consolidating neuromodulation-mediated neural changes and the critical role of PoNS mechanism of neuroplasticity in functional rehabilitation of gait and balance.”\n\n**About PoNS Therapeutic Experience Program (PoNSTEP)**\n\nThe Therapeutic Experience Program (“TEP”) is a Helius-sponsored, open label observational, interventional multi-center outcome research study designed to assess adherence to on-label PoNS Therapy for improvement in gait deficits for patients with multiple sclerosis (“MS”) in a real-world clinical setting. The study aims to understand better the relationship between adherence to on label (100-120 minute per day) PoNS Therapy, which combines the PoNS device with physical therapy, and the therapeutic outcome on gait deficit improvement over 14 weeks of study treatment, as measured by changes in the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) scores. PoNS Therapy is applied in a supervised clinical setting for the first two weeks (Phase 1) and, independently, at home for the remaining 12 weeks (Phase 2). The study also includes a six month no-treatment follow-up phase aimed at establishing durability of therapeutic effect (Phase 3).\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is maintenance of gait improvement from the end of supervised therapy (Phase 1) to the end of unsupervised therapy (Phase 2) in relation to the subject’s adherence to PoNS Therapy. The secondary endpoint is improvement of gait and balance deficit over time and clinical global impression of change.\n\nThe study is currently ongoing at six Centers of Excellence across the United States, including Neurology Center of New England in Foxboro (MA), the Shepherd Center in Atlanta (GA), Montefiore Medical Center (“Montefiore”) in NY (NY), Oregon Health & Science University (“OHSU”) in Portland (OR), MGH Institute of Health Professions in Boston (MA), NYU Langone Health in NY (NY), and recruited 43 MS participants with gait deficit. PoNSTEP will be completed by the end of 2024 and the Company expects to announce the full results early in 2025.\n\n**About Helius Medical Technologies, Inc.**\n\nHelius Medical Technologies is a leading neurotech company in the medical device field focused on neurologic deficits using orally applied technology platform that amplifies the brain’s ability to engage physiologic compensatory mechanisms and promote neuroplasticity, improving the lives of people dealing with neurologic diseases.

(Nasdaq:HSDT) (“Helius” or the “Company”), a neurotech company focused on delivering a novel therapeutic neuromodulation approach for balance and gait deficits, today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter and Recent Business Updates**\n\n  * Secured the first third-party reimbursement for the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (“PoNS®”) device from a major insurance carrier at $23,900, representing a significant milestone toward increasing PoNS accessibility.\n  * Received preliminary Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) payment determination for reimbursement of PoNS, paving the way to final price determination on October 1, 2024.\n  * Completed site participation enrollment for the U.S. registrational program in stroke; on track for a submission in the first half of 2025 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).\n  * Secured Federal Supply Schedule contract pricing with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) at $23,843.72 and $7,344.97 for the PoNS device and mouthpiece, respectively, through its partnership with Lovell® Government Services.\n  * Secured DAPA contract pricing with the U.S. Department of Department of Defense (“DoD”) at $23,724.50 and $7,308.25 for the PoNS device and mouthpiece, respectively, through its partnership with Lovell Government Services.\n  * Commenced building out nationwide sales representation at VA sites in June 2024, establishing coverage in thirteen states plus Puerto Rico to date.\n  * Q2 2024 revenue up $47 thousand or 35% compared to Q1 2024, reflecting increased product sales in both the U.S. and Canada.\n  * Q2 2024 revenue of $182 thousand, compared to $256 thousand in Q2 2023, reflecting the expiration of the Patient Therapy Access Program (“PTAP”) on June 30, 2023.\n  * Closed on $6.4 million public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $5.5 million.\n\n\n\n“Our team has been working tirelessly to get PoNS into the hands of MS patients who suffer from gait and balance impairment. These efforts are starting to pay off and during the quarter we made several important advancements toward removing barriers to our innovative technology. We were pleased to announce the first third-party reimbursement for PoNS from a major insurance carrier at $23,900 and are now just a few weeks away from CMS publishing its final reimbursement rates to be effective on October 1, which we believe will be a significant catalyst for growing revenue as well as negotiating reimbursement with other third-party payers,” stated Helius’ President and Chief Executive Officer, Dane Andreeff.\n\nHe continued, “In June, we completed site participation enrollment for our registrational program in stroke. This groundbreaking program is being conducted at several of the top neurorehabilitation centers in the U.S., and the results will be crucial to seeking regulatory approval in 2025. To bolster our FDA submission and support national reimbursement efforts in Canada, we’ve begun a Canadian study with the goal of enrolling at least 40 subjects at three centers of excellence for stroke rehabilitation.”\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 will be pivotal for Helius and will help frame our future.

I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished to get to this point and excited about the outlook for Helius as these key milestones play out,” concluded Andreeff.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $182 thousand, a decrease of $74 thousand compared to $256 thousand in the second quarter of 2023, resulting from the termination of PTAP on June 30, 2023, and the termination of temporary cash pay pricing in May 2024. Revenue for the quarter increased by $47 thousand or 35% compared to the first quarter of 2024, as a result of increased sales in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\nCost of revenue decreased to $118 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $184 thousand for the comparable period in 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales compared to the same period in the prior year.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.5 million, comparable to the $2.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the second quarter of 2024 increased slightly to $0.9 million, compared to $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2023, driven primarily by an increase in clinical trial activities for stroke and risk of fall programs.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $3.3 million, flat compared to the $3.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $3.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million for the prior year period.\n\nNet loss was $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, flat compared to a net loss of $1.6 million in the corresponding prior year period. The basic and diluted net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.64 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.92 per share for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Cash and Liquidity**\n\nCash used in operating activities was flat at $5.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $6.4 million and no debt outstanding with a projected cash runway into 2025.\n\n**Conference Call**  \n---  \nDate:| Monday, August 12, 2024  \nTime:| 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time  \nRegister (Audio only):| [Click Here](https://register.vevent.com/register/BI0c8c0cb405f8450185171e4ef2be4c16)  \nWebcast:| [Click Here](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/imzpt5zp)  \n  \nThe webcast will be archived under the Newsroom section of the Company’s investor relations website.\n\n**About Helius Medical Technologies, Inc.**\n\nHelius Medical Technologies is a leading neurotech company in the medical device field focused on neurologic deficits using an orally applied technology platform that amplifies the brain’s ability to engage physiologic compensatory mechanisms and promote neuroplasticity, improving the lives of people dealing with neurologic diseases.

(Nasdaq:HSDT) (“Helius” or the “Company”), a neurotech company focused on delivering a novel therapeutic neuromodulation approach for balance and gait deficits, today announced the completion of site participation enrollment for its stroke registrational program in the U.S. with the addition of REHABOLOGYM, Neurology Center of New England (NCNE), and MGH Institute of Health Professions (MGH-IHP). The stroke registrational program, which also includes Brooks Rehabilitation and Shepherd Center, is designed to establish the effects of cranial-nerve non-invasive neuromodulation (“CN-NINM”), delivered using PoNS Therapy®, on gait and dynamic balance in chronic stroke survivors.\n\nUnder the direction of Avrielle Rykman Peltz, M.A., OTR/L and Dr. Jay Lombard, D.O., REHABOLOGYM has already enrolled six subjects and expects to reach at least ten patients by early July. NCNE and MGH-IHP joined the study in May and June, respectively, and both sites will begin enrollment in July. Brooks Rehabilitation started enrollment in April with three participants to date while Shepherd Center enrolled two participants in May and expects to add two more by the end of June. Helius anticipates enrolling at least thirty patients into the open label study, across all sites, by the end of the third quarter.\n\n“PoNS Therapy has demonstrated the ability to generate neuroplasticity, essentially rewiring parts of the brain to significantly and meaningfully improve gait and balance in chronic stroke survivors. With the addition of REHABOLOGYM, NCNE, and MGH-IHP, we now have five of the top neurorehabilitation centers in the U.S. participating in our stroke registrational program, which will significantly bolster our FDA submission when we submit for regulatory approval in 2025,” said Dr. Antonella Favit-Van Pelt, Helius’ Chief Medical Officer.\n\n“Having spearheaded several research studies on stroke funded by premier public and private medical establishments, Dr. Lombard and I see great potential for PoNS to assist with stroke recovery and are thrilled to partner with Helius on this groundbreaking, multi-center research trial. REHABOLOGYM’s goal is to accelerate the advancement of cutting-edge technologies, especially when they can pair with therapeutic interventions to deliver long-lasting improvements for people affected by neurological conditions and injuries. PoNS Therapy perfectly aligns with our mission, and we believe that together we can help bring new, validated therapies to the neurologically impaired,” said Avrielle Rykman Peltz, M.A., OTR/L, Co-Founder & Chief Operating Officer of REHABOLOGYM.\n\n“Leading research suggests that the brain has significant plasticity, with the ability to establish new pathways after various types of brain injuries including stroke. With the only portable and readily accessible therapy that has the potential to generate neuroplasticity, Helius is leading the way in applying technological breakthroughs at the bedside,” stated Dr. Jay Lombard, D.O., co-investigator at REHABOLOGYM.\n\nThe registrational program was established in part based on real-world evidence from Canada, where PoNS is already authorized for treatment of stroke. To support national reimbursement in Canada, Helius has begun an additional study on the use of PoNS Therapy to treat stroke, with the goal of enrolling 60 subjects by the end of 2024 at three centers of excellence for stroke rehabilitation. The study led by Dr. Murielle Grangeon, PhD, Adm., Founder and General Manager, at Neuro-Concept Rehabilitation Center, with the participation of Neuphysio and Synaptic Health, has already received approval by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB). The sites will begin patient enrollment by the end of the month and the results from this study will be part of the data package submission to obtain FDA authorization for stroke in the United States.\n\n**About REHABOLOGYM**\n\nREHABOLOGYM is a neuro-robotic rehabilitation center utilizing state of the art technologies and comprehensive methodologies for neurological occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), speech therapy (ST/SLP) and certified personal training (CPT).

The PoNS device, which delivers mild electrical impulses to the tongue, is indicated for use in the United States as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild-to-moderate symptoms from multiple sclerosis (“MS”) and is to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and over by prescription only.\n\nPoNS has shown effectiveness in treating gait or balance and a significant reduction in the risk of falling in stroke patients in Canada, where it received authorization for sale in three indications: (i) for use as a short-term treatment (14 weeks) of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from stroke and is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy; (ii) for use as a short-term treatment (14 weeks) of chronic balance deficit due to mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (“mmTBI”) and is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy; and (iii) for use as a short-term treatment (14 weeks) of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from MS and is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy. PoNS is also authorized for sale in Australia for short term use by healthcare professionals as an adjunct to a therapeutic exercise program to improve balance and gait.
