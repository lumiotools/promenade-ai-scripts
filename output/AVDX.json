(Nasdaq: AVDX), a leading provider of accounts payable (AP) automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We delivered solid third quarter 2024 results as measured by virtually every key metric. Starting with year over year revenue growth, which rose by 14.3%, non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 74.5% and 20.7%, respectively. Both the non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter were at the top-end or exceeded the range/targets laid out during the Company’s June 1, 2023 Investor Day. Meanwhile, net cash from operating activities was up more than four-fold to $24.6 million as we extinguished and replaced our higher interest rate $63 million of pre-existing term debt with a relatively cheaper and larger new $150 million credit facility with a potential $150 million accordion feature. Because of the strong execution on our transformational value proposition of accounts payable and payments automation we deliver to our middle market buyer customers and their suppliers through our proprietary two-sided network that we are in such a strong financial position. While the macro backdrop still remains choppy, the recent inflection in transaction retention trends is encouraging. That coupled with the recently launched integration partnerships as well as launching and scaling of new products such as Payment 2.0 Platform, Payment Accelerator 2.0, Spend Management, etc., should advance our growth, profit and value creation objectives,” said Michael Praeger, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder of AvidXchange.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Total revenue was $112.8 million, an increase of 14.3% year-over-year, compared with $98.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 total revenue included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million. Of the $1.5 million in net favorable contribution, $1.1 million favorably benefited software revenue and $0.5 million favorably benefited services revenue, while approximately $0.1 million was unfavorable to payment revenue.\n  * Revenue included interest income of $12.7 million compared with $10.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net income was $4.0 million, compared with a GAAP net loss of $(8.1) million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 GAAP net income included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net of tax contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n  * Non-GAAP net income was $15.7 million, compared with $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 Non-GAAP net income included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net of tax contribution of which was $1.1 million.\n  * GAAP gross profit was $76.4 million, or 67.7% of total revenue, compared with $62.3 million, or 63.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 GAAP gross profit included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n  * Non-GAAP gross profit was $84.0 million, or 74.5% of total revenue, compared with $69.1 million, or 70.0% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 Non-GAAP gross profit included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $23.3 million compared with $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n\n\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables following the financial statements in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Business Metrics and Highlights:**\n\n  * Total transactions processed in the third quarter of 2024 were 20.2 million, an increase of 5.2% from 19.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Total payment volume in the third quarter of 2024 was $21.5 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $19.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Transaction yield in the third quarter of 2024 was $5.59, an increase of 8.5% from $5.15 in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 transaction yield included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million, or $0.08.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nAs of November 6, 2024, AvidXchange anticipates its Full Year 2024 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) to be in the following ranges (in millions, except per share data): \n\n**Current** **FY 2024 Guidance**| **Previous** **FY 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---  \nRevenue (1&2)| $437.0 - $439.0| $436.0 - $439.0  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1,2&3)| $78.0 - $79.0| $73.0 - $75.0  \nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS(3)| $0.24 - $0.25  \n  \n  1. The current FY 2024 guidance anticipates interest revenue contribution of approximately $50.0 million compared to $49.0 million previously\n  2. The current FY 2024 guidance anticipates political revenue contribution of approximately $6.5 million compared to $9.0 million previously\n  3. Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP diluted EPS to basic and diluted EPS on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from the non-GAAP measures.\n\n\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Earnings Teleconference Information** AvidXchange will discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results during a teleconference today, November 6, 2024, at 10:00 AM ET. The call will be broadcast simultaneously via webcast at [_https://ir.avidxchange.com/_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aOIOe0Pn152OUDf8Nvq1bS6XzZvjHuugWC6gD9d86jq5sSaufODZJ2ZeUvYxBzK9L-HuxHN7FdWE5h38y-3LF-n1AnCjuMQQrngVtfgBatM=). Following the completion of the call, a recorded replay of the webcast will be available on AvidXchange’s website.

In this context, forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance and often contain words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “outlook,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “will” and similar words and phrases indicating future results. The information presented in this press release related to our expectations of future performance, including guidance for our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024, the continued strength of our financial position and execution on behalf of buyers and suppliers, the macroeconomic backdrop within verticals in which we have domain expertise, future trends reflecting transaction retention, our ability to accelerate revenue growth, the advancement of our growth, profit and value creation objectives through integration partnerships and the launch and scaling of new products, and other statements that are not purely statements of historical fact, are forward-looking in nature. These forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. We therefore cannot guarantee future results, performance or achievements.\n\nFactors which could cause actual results or effects to differ materially from those reflected in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors and other cautionary statements described, from time to time, in AvidXchange’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including, without limitation, AvidXchange’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC, which may be obtained on the investor relations section of our website (https://ir.avidxchange.com/) and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statements made by us in this press release are based only on information currently available to us and speak only as of the date they are made, and we assume no obligation to update any of these statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise unless required under the federal securities laws.\n\n**Non-GAAP** **Measures and Other Performance Metrics** To supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance: Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share.\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share in this press release. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as revenue less cost of revenue excluding the portion of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenues. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss before depreciation and amortization, impairment and write-off of intangible assets, interest income and expense, income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation expense, transaction and acquisition-related costs expensed, change in fair value of derivative instrument, non-recurring items not indicative of ongoing operations, and charitable contributions of common stock. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net loss before amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment and write-off of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, transaction and acquisition-related costs expensed, change in fair value of derivative instrument, non-recurring items not indicative of ongoing operations, acquisition-related effects on income tax, and charitable contributions of common stock. Non-GAAP income tax expense is calculated using our blended statutory rate except in periods of non-GAAP net loss when it is based on our GAAP income tax expense. In each case, non-GAAP income tax expense excludes the effects of acquisitions in the period on tax expense. We define Non-GAAP Earnings per Share as Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per diluted share.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\n**Availability of Information on AvidXchange’s Website** Investors and others should note that AvidXchange routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, and the Investor Relations section of AvidXchange’s website.

(Nasdaq: AVDX), a leading provider of accounts payable (AP) automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We delivered solid third quarter 2024 results as measured by virtually every key metric. Starting with year over year revenue growth, which rose by 14.3%, non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 74.5% and 20.7%, respectively. Both the non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter were at the top-end or exceeded the range/targets laid out during the Company’s June 1, 2023 Investor Day. Meanwhile, net cash from operating activities was up more than four-fold to $24.6 million as we extinguished and replaced our higher interest rate $63 million of pre-existing term debt with a relatively cheaper and larger new $150 million credit facility with a potential $150 million accordion feature. Because of the strong execution on our transformational value proposition of accounts payable and payments automation we deliver to our middle market buyer customers and their suppliers through our proprietary two-sided network that we are in such a strong financial position. While the macro backdrop still remains choppy, the recent inflection in transaction retention trends is encouraging. That coupled with the recently launched integration partnerships as well as launching and scaling of new products such as Payment 2.0 Platform, Payment Accelerator 2.0, Spend Management, etc., should advance our growth, profit and value creation objectives,” said Michael Praeger, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder of AvidXchange.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Total revenue was $112.8 million, an increase of 14.3% year-over-year, compared with $98.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 total revenue included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million. Of the $1.5 million in net favorable contribution, $1.1 million favorably benefited software revenue and $0.5 million favorably benefited services revenue, while approximately $0.1 million was unfavorable to payment revenue.\n  * Revenue included interest income of $12.7 million compared with $10.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net income was $4.0 million, compared with a GAAP net loss of $(8.1) million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 GAAP net income included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net of tax contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n  * Non-GAAP net income was $15.7 million, compared with $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 Non-GAAP net income included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net of tax contribution of which was $1.1 million.\n  * GAAP gross profit was $76.4 million, or 67.7% of total revenue, compared with $62.3 million, or 63.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 GAAP gross profit included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n  * Non-GAAP gross profit was $84.0 million, or 74.5% of total revenue, compared with $69.1 million, or 70.0% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 Non-GAAP gross profit included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $23.3 million compared with $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million.\n\n\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables following the financial statements in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Business Metrics and Highlights:**\n\n  * Total transactions processed in the third quarter of 2024 were 20.2 million, an increase of 5.2% from 19.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Total payment volume in the third quarter of 2024 was $21.5 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $19.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Transaction yield in the third quarter of 2024 was $5.59, an increase of 8.5% from $5.15 in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 transaction yield included a favorable out of period adjustment, the net contribution of which was $1.5 million, or $0.08.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nAs of November 6, 2024, AvidXchange anticipates its Full Year 2024 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) to be in the following ranges (in millions, except per share data): \n\n**Current** **FY 2024 Guidance**| **Previous** **FY 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---  \nRevenue (1&2)| $437.0 - $439.0| $436.0 - $439.0  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1,2&3)| $78.0 - $79.0| $73.0 - $75.0  \nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS(3)| $0.24 - $0.25  \n  \n  1. The current FY 2024 guidance anticipates interest revenue contribution of approximately $50.0 million compared to $49.0 million previously\n  2. The current FY 2024 guidance anticipates political revenue contribution of approximately $6.5 million compared to $9.0 million previously\n  3. Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP diluted EPS to basic and diluted EPS on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from the non-GAAP measures.\n\n\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Earnings Teleconference Information** AvidXchange will discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results during a teleconference today, November 6, 2024, at 10:00 AM ET.

In this context, forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance and often contain words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “outlook,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “will” and similar words and phrases indicating future results. The information presented in this press release related to our expectations of future performance, including guidance for our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024, the continued strength of our financial position and execution on behalf of buyers and suppliers, the macroeconomic backdrop within verticals in which we have domain expertise, future trends reflecting transaction retention, our ability to accelerate revenue growth, the advancement of our growth, profit and value creation objectives through integration partnerships and the launch and scaling of new products, and other statements that are not purely statements of historical fact, are forward-looking in nature. These forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. We therefore cannot guarantee future results, performance or achievements.\n\nFactors which could cause actual results or effects to differ materially from those reflected in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors and other cautionary statements described, from time to time, in AvidXchange’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including, without limitation, AvidXchange’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC, which may be obtained on the investor relations section of our website (https://ir.avidxchange.com/) and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statements made by us in this press release are based only on information currently available to us and speak only as of the date they are made, and we assume no obligation to update any of these statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise unless required under the federal securities laws.\n\n**Non-GAAP** **Measures and Other Performance Metrics** To supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance: Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share.\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share in this press release. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as revenue less cost of revenue excluding the portion of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenues. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss before depreciation and amortization, impairment and write-off of intangible assets, interest income and expense, income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation expense, transaction and acquisition-related costs expensed, change in fair value of derivative instrument, non-recurring items not indicative of ongoing operations, and charitable contributions of common stock. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net loss before amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment and write-off of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, transaction and acquisition-related costs expensed, change in fair value of derivative instrument, non-recurring items not indicative of ongoing operations, acquisition-related effects on income tax, and charitable contributions of common stock. Non-GAAP income tax expense is calculated using our blended statutory rate except in periods of non-GAAP net loss when it is based on our GAAP income tax expense. In each case, non-GAAP income tax expense excludes the effects of acquisitions in the period on tax expense. We define Non-GAAP Earnings per Share as Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per diluted share.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\n**Availability of Information on AvidXchange’s Website** Investors and others should note that AvidXchange routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, and the Investor Relations section of AvidXchange’s website.
