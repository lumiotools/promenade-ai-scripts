The award follows the previously signed preliminary memorandum of terms announced in February 2024 and will enable GF to expand its essential chip manufacturing and technology development in the U.S., strengthening supply chains and supporting customers across a range of vital end-markets including automotive, smart mobile devices, IoT, datacenters, and aerospace and defense.\n\n“The idea of strengthening U.S. semiconductor manufacturing has been five-plus years in the making. With bipartisan support, that idea evolved into the CHIPS and Science Act,” said Dr. Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF. “GF's essential chips are at the core of U.S. economic, supply chain and national security. We greatly appreciate the support and funding from both the U.S. Government and the states of New York and Vermont, which we will use to ensure our customers have the American-made chips they need to succeed and win.”\n\nGF’s CHIPS and Science Act award will support three projects:\n\n  * Expansion of GF’s existing Malta, New York, fab by adding critical technologies already in production at GF’s Singapore and Germany facilities, to enable a secure and reliable supply of domestically manufactured essential chips for the U.S. auto industry. \n  * Modernization and upgrading of GF’s existing fab in Essex Junction, Vermont, to expand production capacity and create one of the world’s leading facilities capable of high-volume manufacturing of next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors for use in electric vehicles, data centers, IoT, smartphones and other critical applications. \n  * In alignment with market conditions and customer demand, construction of a new state-of-art fab on GF’s Malta, New York, campus to meet expected demand for U.S.-made essential chips across a broad range of markets and applications including automotive, AI in the data center and at the edge, as well as aerospace and defense. \n\n\n\nThe two New York-based projects are expected to triple the existing capacity of GF’s Malta campus over the next 10-plus years, in alignment with expected market requirements and customer demand. Construction of the new fab will leverage the GF site’s existing infrastructure and ecosystem, enabling a fast and efficient path from construction to production.\n\nIn aggregate, these projects represent more than $13 billion of investment over the next 10-plus years across GF’s two U.S. sites. This investment includes the $1.5 billion CHIPS and Science Act award, more than $550 million in support from the New York State Green CHIPS Program, as well as funding and support from Vermont, GF ecosystem partners and key strategic customers, and other incentives.\n\nCombined, these investments are expected to create close to 1,000 direct manufacturing jobs and more than 9,000 construction jobs over the life of these projects.\n\nGF’s fabs in New York and Vermont are both Trusted Foundry accredited and manufacture secure chips in partnership with the U.S. government.\n\nAs part of its CHIPS and Science Act award, to attract and cultivate a pipeline of semiconductor talent in New York and Vermont, GF will continue to invest in and develop new workforce development efforts including curriculum development, internship and apprenticeship programs, K-12 STEM outreach, as well as additional education and training programs.\n\nConsistent with GF’s longstanding commitment to our communities and the environment, GF’s design and construction plans for its expansions and modernizations in New York and Vermont will reflect the company’s sustainability goals for future operations.\n\n**About GF**\n\nGlobalFoundries (GF) is a leading manufacturer of essential semiconductors the world relies on to live, work and connect.

These forward-looking statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook, future guidance, product development, business strategy and plans, and market trends, opportunities and positioning. These statements are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, forecasts, projections and limited information available at the time they are made. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “believe,” “hope,” “target,” “project,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “could,” “intend,” “shall,” \"outlook,\" “plan” and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are subject to a broad variety of risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown. Any inaccuracy in our assumptions and estimates could affect the realization of the expectations or forecasts in these forward-looking statements. For example, our business could be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as the ongoing political and trade tensions with China and the wars in Ukraine and Israel; domestic political developments, including with respect to the incoming U.S. presidential administration; the market for our products may develop or recover more slowly than expected or than it has in the past; we may fail to achieve the full benefits of our restructuring plan; our operating results may fluctuate more than expected; there may be significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows related to our revenue recognition or otherwise; a network or data security incident that allows unauthorized access to our network or data or our customers’ data could result in a system disruption, loss of data or damage our reputation; we could experience interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology, including a service outage; global economic conditions could deteriorate, including due to increasing interest rates, rising inflation and any potential recession; and our expected results and planned expansions and operations may not proceed as planned if funding we expect to receive (including the awards under the CHIPS and Science Act and New York State Green CHIPS Program) is delayed or withheld for any reason. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market, and new risks may emerge from time to time. These statements are based on our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and projections in light of information currently available to us, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in our statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any information or any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, subsequent events or any other circumstances after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F, current reports on Form 6-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Media Contact:** Michael Mullaney[michael.mullaney@gf.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UgvxiWGqf9NkK-Rjmdf1QhQhMbfucN1XB_Crq46WPreHLYB8aPBV0dx5w6eGlqBosKUO7xdRzwDV1o_K1Ncb2xQ8DZbh7TKBXpC-9xYlrnw=)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI3Njg5NiM2NTkxOTgzIzIwOTk0MzQ=)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NGJkNGM4OGItYTNkOS00MjY4LThjM2QtZjc4MzM0MTUyMTUxLTExMTEwMDU=/tiny/GlobalFoundries-US-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/8d508fc4-5eca-472a-bcd1-34f5750681d1/small/gf-logo-horz-rgb-r-jpg-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8d508fc4-5eca-472a-bcd1-34f5750681d1)\n\nSource: GlobalFoundries Inc.\n\n[ Print Page ]()\n\n**Print Page**\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/rss-feeds)\n\n**RSS Feeds**\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n**Email Alerts**\n\n[ Search ](/search)\n\n**Search**\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GLOBALFOUNDRIES) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/globalfoundries) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GLOBALFOUNDRIES)\n"

The Guidance includes management's beliefs and assumptions and is based on information that is currently available.\n\n(2) Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating expense, Non-IFRS operating profit, Non-IFRS net income and Non-IFRS diluted EPS are Non-IFRS measures and, for purposes of the Guidance only, are defined as gross profit, operating profit, net income and EPS before share-based compensation, respectively. Non-IFRS operating expense is calculated by subtracting Non-IFRS operating profit from Non-IFRS gross profit.\n\n(3) Non-IFRS margins are Non-IFRS measures and for purposes of the Guidance only, are defined as Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating profit and Non-IFRS net income, each divided by net revenue (using the definitions of Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating profit and Non-IFRS net income, in footnote (2) above, as appropriate).\n\n(4)  Included in net income is net interest income and other income and expense which we estimate will be between $7 and $15 million for the fourth quarter 2024. Also included in net income is income tax expense which we estimate will be between $23 million and $35 million for the fourth quarter 2024.\n\n**Consolidated Statements of Operations****(Unaudited, in millions, except for per share amounts)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net revenue**| **$**| **1,739**| **$**| **1,852**  \nCost of revenue| 1,325| 1,323  \n**Gross profit**| **$**| **414**| **$**| **529**  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| 130| 108  \nSelling, general and administrative(1)| 98| 143  \nRestructuring charges| 1| 17  \n**Total operating expenses**| **$**| **229**| **$**| **268**  \n**Operating profit**| **$**| **185**| **$**| **261**  \nFinance income (expense), net| 15| 3  \nOther income (expense)| (5| )| (21| )  \nIncome tax expense| (17| )| 6  \n**Net income**| **$**| **178**| **$**| **249**  \nAttributable to:  \nShareholders of GlobalFoundries| 177| 249  \nNon-controlling interest| 1| —  \n**EPS:**  \nBasic| $| 0.32| $| 0.45  \nDiluted| $| 0.32| $| 0.45  \nShares used in EPS calculation:  \nBasic| 552| 553  \nDiluted| 555| 556  \n  \n(1) Beginning in Q3 2023, selling, general and administrative includes (gain)/loss on tool sales and certain contract cancellation fees.

This change in methodology is in anticipation of future expected proceeds from government grants related to capital expenditures from the planned funding awarded under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and the New York State Green CHIPS, and better aligns our Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow metric to how GF assesses capital decisions internally.

See “Financial Measures (Non-IFRS)\" for a discussion of why we believe these Non-IFRS measures are useful.\n\n**_Financial Measures (Non-IFRS)_**\n\nIn addition to the financial information presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), this press release includes the following Non-IFRS measures: Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating profit, Non-IFRS operating expense, Non-IFRS net income, Non-IFRS selling, general and administrative, Non-IFRS research and development, Non-IFRS diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA, Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow and any related margins. We define each of Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS selling, general and administrative and Non-IFRS research and development as each respective IFRS measure adjusted for share-based compensation. We define Non-IFRS operating profit as operating profit adjusted for share-based compensation and restructuring charges. We define Non-IFRS operating expense as Non-IFRS gross profit minus Non-IFRS operating profit. We define Non-IFRS net income as net income adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges and the associated tax impact. We define Non-IFRS diluted EPS as Non-IFRS net income divided by the diluted shares outstanding. We define Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets plus proceeds from government grants related to capital expenditures. We define Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted for the impact of finance expense, finance income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, restructuring charges, labor optimization initiatives and divestiture gains and associated expenses, legal settlements and transaction expenses. We define Non-IFRS gross margin as Non-IFRS gross profit divided by revenue. We define Non-IFRS operating margin as Non-IFRS operating profit divided by net revenue. We define Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA margin as Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.\n\nWe believe that in addition to our results determined in accordance with IFRS, these Non-IFRS measures provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. These Non-IFRS financial measures provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance that excludes certain gains, losses and non-cash charges that occur relatively infrequently and/or that we consider to be unrelated to our core operations. Management believes that Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow as a Non-IFRS measure is helpful to investors as it provides insights into the nature and amount of cash the Company generates in the period. For further information regarding these Non-IFRS measures, please refer to the \"Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS\" tables.\n\nNon-IFRS financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS. Our presentation of Non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently, which may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Information_**\n\nGF will host a conference call with the financial community on Tuesday, November 5, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (ET) to review the third quarter 2024 results in detail.

These forward-looking statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook, future guidance, product development, business strategy and plans, and market trends, opportunities and positioning. These statements are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, forecasts, projections and limited information available at the time they are made. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “believe,” “hope,” “target,” “project,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “could,” “intend,” “shall,” \"outlook,\" \"on track\" and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are subject to a broad variety of risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown. Any inaccuracy in our assumptions and estimates could affect the realization of the expectations or forecasts in these forward-looking statements. For example, our business could be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as the ongoing political and trade tensions with China and the wars in Ukraine and Israel; domestic political developments, including with respect to the U.S. presidential election; the market for our products may develop or recover more slowly than expected or than it has in the past; we may fail to achieve the full benefits of our restructuring plan; our operating results may fluctuate more than expected; there may be significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows related to our revenue recognition or otherwise; a network or data security incident that allows unauthorized access to our network or data or our customers’ data could result in a system disruption, loss of data or damage our reputation; we could experience interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology, including a service outage; global economic conditions could deteriorate, including due to increasing interest rates, rising inflation and any potential recession; and our expected results and planned expansions and operations may not proceed as planned if funding we expect to receive (including the planned awards under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and New York State Green CHIPS) is delayed or withheld for any reason. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market, and new risks may emerge from time to time. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These statements are based on our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and projections in light of information currently available to us, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in our statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. Recipients are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made and should not be construed as statements of fact. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any information or any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, subsequent events or any other circumstances after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

(GF) (Nasdaq: GFS) today announced preliminary financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Key Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $1.739 billion\n  * Gross margin of 23.8% and Non-IFRS gross margin(1) of 24.7%\n  * Operating margin of 10.6% and Non-IFRS operating margin(1) of 13.6%\n  * Net income of $178 million and Non-IFRS net income(1) of $229 million\n  * Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA(1) of $627 million\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $4.3 billion\n  * Year to date net cash provided by operating activities of $1,265 million and Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow(1) of $779 million\n\n\n\n\"In the third quarter, the GF team continued to execute next generation opportunities with our customers, by securing key design wins across our growing portfolio of essential chip technologies,” said Dr. Thomas Caulfield, President and CEO of GF. \"We delivered consistent financial results at the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in our August earnings release, and as we continue to navigate the ongoing uncertainties facing our industry, we remain on-track to deliver approximately a threefold increase in our year-over-year Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow generation by the end of 2024.\"\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Building on the longtime relationship between GF and NXP Semiconductors (NXP), the companies announced a new collaboration leveraging GF's 22FDX® process technology platform and global manufacturing footprint to optimize the power, performance and time-to-market of NXP's solutions across a range of automotive, IoT and smart mobile devices.

The Guidance includes management's beliefs and assumptions and is based on information that is currently available.\n\n(2) Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating expense, Non-IFRS operating profit, Non-IFRS net income and Non-IFRS diluted EPS are Non-IFRS measures and, for purposes of the Guidance only, are defined as gross profit, operating profit, net income and EPS before share-based compensation, respectively. Non-IFRS operating expense is calculated by subtracting Non-IFRS operating profit from Non-IFRS gross profit.\n\n(3) Non-IFRS margins are Non-IFRS measures and for purposes of the Guidance only, are defined as Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating profit and Non-IFRS net income, each divided by net revenue (using the definitions of Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating profit and Non-IFRS net income, in footnote (2) above, as appropriate).\n\n(4)  Included in net income is net interest income and other income and expense which we estimate will be between $7 and $15 million for the fourth quarter 2024. Also included in net income is income tax expense which we estimate will be between $23 million and $35 million for the fourth quarter 2024.\n\n**Consolidated Statements of Operations****(Unaudited, in millions, except for per share amounts)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net revenue**| **$**| **1,739**| **$**| **1,852**  \nCost of revenue| 1,325| 1,323  \n**Gross profit**| **$**| **414**| **$**| **529**  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| 130| 108  \nSelling, general and administrative(1)| 98| 143  \nRestructuring charges| 1| 17  \n**Total operating expenses**| **$**| **229**| **$**| **268**  \n**Operating profit**| **$**| **185**| **$**| **261**  \nFinance income (expense), net| 15| 3  \nOther income (expense)| (5| )| (21| )  \nIncome tax expense| (17| )| 6  \n**Net income**| **$**| **178**| **$**| **249**  \nAttributable to:  \nShareholders of GlobalFoundries| 177| 249  \nNon-controlling interest| 1| —  \n**EPS:**  \nBasic| $| 0.32| $| 0.45  \nDiluted| $| 0.32| $| 0.45  \nShares used in EPS calculation:  \nBasic| 552| 553  \nDiluted| 555| 556  \n  \n(1) Beginning in Q3 2023, selling, general and administrative includes (gain)/loss on tool sales and certain contract cancellation fees.

This change in methodology is in anticipation of future expected proceeds from government grants related to capital expenditures from the planned funding awarded under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and the New York State Green CHIPS, and better aligns our Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow metric to how GF assesses capital decisions internally.

See “Financial Measures (Non-IFRS)\" for a discussion of why we believe these Non-IFRS measures are useful.\n\n**_Financial Measures (Non-IFRS)_**\n\nIn addition to the financial information presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), this press release includes the following Non-IFRS measures: Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS operating profit, Non-IFRS operating expense, Non-IFRS net income, Non-IFRS selling, general and administrative, Non-IFRS research and development, Non-IFRS diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA, Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow and any related margins. We define each of Non-IFRS gross profit, Non-IFRS selling, general and administrative and Non-IFRS research and development as each respective IFRS measure adjusted for share-based compensation. We define Non-IFRS operating profit as operating profit adjusted for share-based compensation and restructuring charges. We define Non-IFRS operating expense as Non-IFRS gross profit minus Non-IFRS operating profit. We define Non-IFRS net income as net income adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges and the associated tax impact. We define Non-IFRS diluted EPS as Non-IFRS net income divided by the diluted shares outstanding. We define Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets plus proceeds from government grants related to capital expenditures. We define Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted for the impact of finance expense, finance income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, restructuring charges, labor optimization initiatives and divestiture gains and associated expenses, legal settlements and transaction expenses. We define Non-IFRS gross margin as Non-IFRS gross profit divided by revenue. We define Non-IFRS operating margin as Non-IFRS operating profit divided by net revenue. We define Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA margin as Non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.\n\nWe believe that in addition to our results determined in accordance with IFRS, these Non-IFRS measures provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. These Non-IFRS financial measures provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance that excludes certain gains, losses and non-cash charges that occur relatively infrequently and/or that we consider to be unrelated to our core operations. Management believes that Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow as a Non-IFRS measure is helpful to investors as it provides insights into the nature and amount of cash the Company generates in the period. For further information regarding these Non-IFRS measures, please refer to the \"Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS\" tables.\n\nNon-IFRS financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS. Our presentation of Non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently, which may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Information_**\n\nGF will host a conference call with the financial community on Tuesday, November 5, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (ET) to review the third quarter 2024 results in detail.

For example, our business could be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as the ongoing political and trade tensions with China and the wars in Ukraine and Israel; domestic political developments, including with respect to the U.S. presidential election; the market for our products may develop or recover more slowly than expected or than it has in the past; we may fail to achieve the full benefits of our restructuring plan; our operating results may fluctuate more than expected; there may be significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows related to our revenue recognition or otherwise; a network or data security incident that allows unauthorized access to our network or data or our customers’ data could result in a system disruption, loss of data or damage our reputation; we could experience interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology, including a service outage; global economic conditions could deteriorate, including due to increasing interest rates, rising inflation and any potential recession; and our expected results and planned expansions and operations may not proceed as planned if funding we expect to receive (including the planned awards under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and New York State Green CHIPS) is delayed or withheld for any reason. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market, and new risks may emerge from time to time. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These statements are based on our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and projections in light of information currently available to us, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in our statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. Recipients are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made and should not be construed as statements of fact. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any information or any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, subsequent events or any other circumstances after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties, please refer to the risk factors and cautionary statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F, current reports on Form 6-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of our SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website, investors.gf.com, or from the SEC website, www.sec.gov.\n\n**_For further information, please contact:_**\n\nInvestor Relations _[ir@gf.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-ANpbyBEJ04Y-wPtTXWL0TiH7VCLn777sxM1SWFZWih9bL5M2ezkm1w8f4ER8dXVzeuXVEa49hBk5jpaHvbqZg==)_\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ODhjZDNkNWItM2YzOC00ZWZhLTkxYzAtMzcyMWZhN2UxZDE3LTExMTEwMDU=/tiny/GlobalFoundries-US-Inc-.png)\n\n[ Print Page ]()\n\n**Print Page**\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/rss-feeds)\n\n**RSS Feeds**\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n**Email Alerts**\n\n[ Search ](/search)\n\n**Search**\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GLOBALFOUNDRIES) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/globalfoundries) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GLOBALFOUNDRIES)\n"
