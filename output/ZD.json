(NASDAQ: ZD) (“Ziff Davis” or “the Company”) today reported unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are very pleased with our third quarter results,” said Vivek Shah, Chief Executive Officer of Ziff Davis. “We are seeing improvements in the businesses that we currently own, as well as opportunities to leverage our strong balance sheet and free cash flows to acquire businesses that we would like to own.” \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\n  * Q3 2024 quarterly revenues increased 3.7% to $353.6 million compared to $341.0 million for Q3 2023. \n\n\n  * Loss from operations increased to $29.3 million compared to $13.3 million for Q3 2023.

It is anticipated that the Adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 will be between 23.25% and 25.25%. \n\nA reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is not available without unreasonable effort due, primarily, to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of non-operating matters that may arise in the future. \n\n**Earnings Conference Call and Audio Webcast**\n\nZiff Davis will host a live audio webcast and conference call discussing its third quarter 2024 financial results on Friday, November 8, 2024, at 8:30AM ET.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results or, in certain cases, may be non-cash in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (2) certain measures are used to determine the amount of annual incentive compensation paid to our named executive officers, and (3) they are used by the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and our use of these terms may vary from that of other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude the certain items listed below. We believe that excluding these items from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which exclude similar items. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency of certain line items in the Company’s financial statements. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is defined as Net income (loss) with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain items including, but not limited to: \n\n  * Interest expense, net. Interest expense is generated primarily from interest due on outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income generated from the interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments; \n\n\n  * (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment, net. This is a non-cash expense that relates to extinguishments of long-term debt obligations. We believe this (gain) loss does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * (Gain) loss on sale of business. This gain or loss relates to the sales of businesses and does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * (Gain) loss on investments, net. This item includes realized gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses, and impairment charges on debt and equity investments. The amount of gain or loss depends on the share price for investments with readily determinable fair value and on observable price changes for investments without a readily determinable fair value, and does not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Other (income) loss, net. This income or expense relates to other non-operating items and does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Income tax (benefit) expense. This benefit or expense depends on the pre-tax loss or income of the Company, statutory tax rates, tax regulations, and different tax rates in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and which the Company does not have the control over; \n\n\n  * (Income) loss from equity method investments, net. This is a non-cash expense as it relates primarily to our investment in OCV Fund I, LP (the “Fund”). We believe that gain or loss resulting from our equity method investment does not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Depreciation and amortization. This is a non-cash expense at it relates to use and associated reduction in value of certain assets including equipment, fixtures, and certain capitalized internal-used software and website development costs, and identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired businesses; \n\n\n  * Share-based compensation. This is a non-cash expense as it relates to awards granted under the various share-based incentive plans of the Company. We view the economic cost of share-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; \n\n\n  * Acquisition, integration, and other costs. Includes adjustments to contingent consideration, lease terminations, retention bonuses, other acquisition-specific items, and other costs, such as severance, third-party debt modification costs, and legal settlements. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Disposal related costs. These are expenses associated with the disposal of certain businesses that do not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Lease asset impairments and other charges. These expenses are incurred in connection with impaired right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of the Company. Associated expenses are comprised of insurance, utility, and other charges related to assets that are no longer in use, and partially offset by the sublease income earned. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; and \n\n\n  * Goodwill impairment on business. This is a non-cash expense that is recorded when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and does not represent core business operating results of the Company. \n\n\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA margin** is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Total revenues. \n\n**Adjusted net income (loss)** is defined as Net income (loss) with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain statement of operations items including, but not limited to: \n\n  * Interest, net. This reflects the difference between the imputed and coupon interest expense associated with the 4.625% Senior Notes and a charge that the Company determined to be penalty interest associated with the 1.75% Convertible Notes in each period presented, offset in part by a certain interest income earned by the Company. These net expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment, net. This is a non-cash expense that relates to extinguishments of long-term debt obligations. We believe this gain or loss does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * (Gain) loss on sale of business. This gain or loss relates to the sales of businesses and does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * (Gain) loss on investments, net. This item includes realized gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses, and impairment charges on debt and equity investments. The amount of gain or loss depends on the share price for investments with readily determinable fair value and on observable price changes for investments without a readily determinable fair value, and does not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * (Income) loss from equity method investments, net. This is a non-cash income or expense as it relates primarily to our investment in the OCV Fund. We believe that gains or losses resulting from our equity method investment do not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Amortization. Includes the amortization of patents and intangible assets that we acquired. This is a non-cash expense as it primarily relates to identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired businesses. We believe that acquired intangible assets represent cost incurred by the acquiree to build value prior to the acquisition and the amortization of this cost does not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Share-based compensation. This is a non-cash expense as it relates to awards granted under the various incentive plans of the Company. We view the economic cost of share-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; \n\n\n  * Acquisition, integration, and other costs. Includes adjustments to contingent consideration, lease terminations, retention bonuses, other acquisition-specific items, and other costs, such as severance, third-party debt modification costs, and legal settlements. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Disposal related costs. These are expenses associated with the disposal of certain businesses that do not represent core business operating results of the Company; \n\n\n  * Lease asset impairments and other charges. These expenses are incurred in connection with impaired ROU assets of the Company. Associated expenses are comprised of insurance, utility, and other charges related to assets that are no longer in use, and partially offset by the sublease income earned. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; and \n\n\n  * Goodwill impairment on business. This is a non-cash expense that is recorded when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and does not represent core business operating results of the Company. \n\n\n\n**Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share** is calculated by dividing Adjusted net income (loss) by the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding excluding the effect of convertible debt dilution. \n\n**Free cash flow** is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment, plus changes in contingent consideration (if any). \n\n**Adjusted effective tax rate** is calculated based upon the GAAP effective tax rate with adjustments for the tax applicable to non-GAAP adjustments to Net income (loss), generally based upon the effective marginal tax rate of each adjustment. \n\n**ZIFF DAVIS, INC.
