The decrease was primarily attributable to: (i) a 34.3% increase in sales orders, primarily due to promotional campaigns and new marketing channels; and (ii) a decrease of 30.5% in the average revenue per order, mainly due to consumer spending changes in response to recent economic conditions in Australia. Management believes that the market will gradually recover, and the fitness and wellness industry in Australia is still promising in the long-term.\n  * In the three months ended December 2023, merchandise revenue increased $103,849 or 10.9% compared to the same period in 2022.\n  * **Sales of consumable products** represents the revenue generated by selling various lifestyle products. There were no sales of consumable products, and management plans to develop this business segment again whenever business opportunity arises.\n  * **Revenue from licensing customers** represents the services provided to gym studios in overseas markets. Revenue from licensing customers decreased by 61.4% or $181,308 to $115,557. The decrease was due to management suspending overseas expansions recently due to market sentiment from inflation and rising interest rates in the global market, Management plans to expand these services again, especially to the Asia market, when the time is right.\n\n\n\n**Cost of goods sold** was $1,275,967, representing a decrease by approximately $185,478, or 12.7% from the same period in 2022.\n\n**Gross profit** was $847,152, a decrease of $745,555, or 46.8% from the same period in 2022. The decrease was due to the drop in merchandise revenue, sales of consumable products, and licensing income. Gross profit margin was 39.9%, a decrease from 52.1% for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, due to the decline of the high-margin consumable products and licensing segments.\n\n**Consulting fees** were $1,272,468 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2023, compared to nil in the same period of 2022. Since the successful listing on Nasdaq, the management has proactively engaged various consulting firms to assist the company in setting long-term business development plans and identifying new business growth opportunities.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** were $1,268,545, an increase of $1,099,110, or 648.6% from $169,445 for the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly due to (i) research and development expenses on mobile app of $798,684; (ii) an $99,801 increase of insurance expense related to D&O insurance coverage post-Nasdaq listing; and (iii) an $71,945 increase of audit fees due to the Company’s listing.\n\n**Net loss** was $2,661,707, a decrease of $2,602,382 from the same period in 2022. The net loss was mainly due to the aforesaid decrease in total revenues and the increase in consulting fees and general and administrative expenses.\n\n**About Fitell Corporation**\n\nFitell Corporation, through GD Wellness Pty Ltd (“GD”), its wholly owned subsidiary, is an online retailer of gym and fitness equipment both under its proprietary brands and other brand names in Australia.

I will review the fiscal year\nof 2023 financials with you and I will be available for the Q&A session if you have any questions.\nBefore I review the number, let me remind you that all figures I discuss are for this reporting period\n- fiscal year of 2023, unless I stated otherwise. Additionally, any year-over-year comparison is to\nJune 30 of 2022. Now, let’s go over our 2023 financial results.\n[Page 13] I will begin with an overview of our consolidated results on Slide 11. In the fiscal year\nof 2023, Fitell generated approximately 4.8 million in revenue. Our gross profit is about 2.2 million\nwith a net income of approximately -1.6 million. Our gross profit margin is fairly consistent with\nlast year’s, which is 45.3%. I will deep dive into each category and segment in the next slide.\n[Page 14] In this slide, I will dive deeper into the financial performance of each of our product\ncategories. Our revenue consists of 3 product categories: merchandise revenue, sales of\nconsumable products and revenue from licensing customers. Merchandise revenue represents the\nsales of our gym and fitness equipment products; consumable products are various lifestyle\nproducts; last but not least, licensing business include licensing and management consultant\nincome and agency fee for distributing other miscellaneous items.\nMerchandise revenue was about 4.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. It accounts\nfor approximately 84% of our total revenue. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease\nin sales order, which was due to the decrease of disposal income of Australian households caused\nby the inflation and increasing interest rate. In addition, there is also a slight decrease in the average\nrevenue per order.\n3\nConsumable products include, but not limited to, coffee and nutritional supplement products. The\nsales of consumable products were about 223 thousand in fiscal year 2023, which accounted for\nabout 4.7% of the total revenue. The sales of consumable products increased about 11.6%\ncompared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to our efforts in diversifying\nour revenue streams to mitigate the other negative effects.\nOur licensing business generated approximately 540 thousand, and it accounts for approximately\n11.2% of our total revenue. The decrease was mainly due to the temporary suspension of the\noverseas expansion plan due to the inflation and rising interest rates in global markets.\n[Page 15] Our growth in both number of customers and orders from FY2022 to FY2023 was\naffected by inflation and raising of interest rate in Australia. We have received about 15 thousands\norders and acquired approximately 23 thousand customers in 2023, an decrease of 42.6% and\n41.1%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2022. The average order value per sales order\nhave slightly decreased by 3% in FY2023 compared to FY2022. Members - 171,905 members by\nend of FY2023, compared to 167,264 members at the end of FY2022.\nDespite it was a challenging year with declining revenues for us, especially in the merchandise\nsales and licensing business segments, our management team remains dedicated to working\ntirelessly to promote our products and retain our loyal customers. Instead of being disheartened by\nthe setback because of the downfall of the global economic market, we have doubled down our\nefforts to promote business growth. We are committed to innovative strategies, market research\nand we will continue to expand the licensing business service again in the Asian market when we\nidentify the beneficial opportunities. We believe that the company will show resilience and reap\nthe rewards of growth and success in the near future.\n[Page 16] Next, I will go over the key subsequent event after our fiscal year 2023. On August 8,\n2023, we successfully listed on Nasdaq and raised a net proceeds of approximately $13.6 million\nfor the issuance of 3,000,000 shares of common stock. On October 23, the Board promoted\nYinying Lu, Fitell’s board of directors promoted general manager of GD Wellness, to CEO of the\nCompany. With that, I will now turn the call back to our investor relations - Yiru.\nQ&A Session\nThank you, Sam and Jamarson.

This mission guides our strategic decisions and underscores our commitment to creating value for our shareholders.\n\nFurthering this perspective, Jamarson Kong, Fitell’s Chief Financial Officer, noted, “Throughout fiscal year 2023, we navigated several economic headwinds, notably the challenges posed by inflation and the rise in interest rates in Australia. Consequently, our financial results for the year reflect some of these challenges. As we look to fiscal year 2024, we stand firm in our commitment to overcoming these challenges and advancing our growth trajectory. He further reported, “We’re focused on executing our long-term strategy, including expanding our business offerings and market footprint. Fitell's successful listing on Nasdaq on August 8, 2023, instills confidence in our ability to deliver on our growth strategies.\"\n\n**FY 2023 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** was $4.8 million, a year-to-year decrease of $3,356,512 or 41.2%, primarily due to reduced consumer spending from inflation and raising of interest rates in Australia.\n  * **Gross profit** was $2.2 million, a year-to-year decrease of $1,462,255 or 40.2%.\n  * **Gross margin** was 45.3%, a year-to-year increase of 0.7%.\n  * Sales of consumable products was $223,343, a year-to-year increase of 11.6% or $23,239, due to efforts to diversify revenue streams.\n\n\n\n**Revenue by Categories vs. Prior Year**\n\nRevenue| Change from FY 2022  \n---|---  \n**US$**| **%**| **US$**| **%**  \nMerchandise revenue| 4,036,047| 84.1%| (3,210,541)| -44.3%  \nSales of consumable products| 223,343| 4.7%| 23,239| 11.6%  \nRevenue from licensing customers| 539,832| 11.2%| (169,210)| -23.9%  \n  \n  * **Merchandise revenue** decreased significantly by 44.3% or $3,210,541 to $4,036,04. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (i) a 42.6% decrease in sales order, primarily due to inflation and raising of interest rates in Australia; (ii) a decrease of 3.0% in the average revenue per order. Despite the consumer confidences in Australia is week recently, but the management has devoted a lot of marketing efforts in promoting our products and have successfully retained many loyal customers.\n  * **Sales of consumable products** represents the revenue generated by selling various lifestyle products. The sales of consumable products have increased 11.6% or $23,239 to $223,343 from $200,104 in FY 2022. The increase was due to our additional efforts to diversify our revenue streams, to mitigate the negative financial impact attributed to the decline in merchandise revenue.\n  * **Revenue from licensing customers** represents licensing, management consultant income, and some agency fee for distributing other miscellaneous items. Revenue from licensing customers has decreased by 23.9% or $169,216 to $539,832 in FY 2023 from $709,042 in FY 2022. The decrease was due to the temporarily suspension of the overseas expansions recently, because the market sentiments are negatively affected by the inflations and the rising in interest rate in the global market. Nevertheless, we will expand these services again, especially to the Asia market, when the time is right.\n\n\n\n**Cost of goods sold** decreased by approximately $1.9 million, or 41.9%, from $4,520,078 in FY 2022 to $2,625,821.\n\n**Gross profit** was $2,173,401 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and $3,635,656 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of $1,462,255, or 40.2%. The decrease was a combined result of the decrease in merchandise revenues and service revenue.\n\n**The gross profit margin** increased 0.7% from 44.6% in FY 2022, to 45.3. The slight increase is mainly due to the change in revenue mix, as we have generated relatively more services revenue.\n\n**The IPO related expenses** were $662,418 for consulting fee which is related to the Initial Public Offering project.\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\n  * On August 8, 2023, the Company has successfully listed on Nasdaq and has raised a net proceed of approximately $13.6 million for the issuance of 3,000,000 shares of common stock.\n  * Subsequent to June 30, 2023, the Company has entered into a consulting agreement with a third party, for future capital market and fund-raising consulting services. The consideration of the contract is $1.8 million.\n  * On October 23, 2023, at the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board appointed Yinying “Sam” Lu, a member of the Board, to serve as Chief Executive Officer beginning as of October 23, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nThe company will host an investor conference call and webcast to discuss the results at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Tuesday, October 31, 2023, before the market opens.\n\nA live webcast of the conference call will be available on the company’s investor relations website at [https://www.fitellcorp.com/investorrelations-ep](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OzvbChv6vVXeSRswc5Y_c4Mv6RPKRo4PUEYFYcZ1-bakVkOabWUhvokRU19UmZX-evV3YgKxnKBP3Hr-QzL7j0qrQzlCt-QrXt7BkPMXE4y5Y2iKd4SL1LWFBTwCQVE5RRuKJTg5gsrAkcEok3-u-ffbv-82XqguDB6XYi35PSo=), along with the company's earnings press release and slide presentation.

Finally, seize opportunities to explore other revenue streams, including developing a host of\nsolutions for white-label functional health supplement products, expanding businesses into used fitness\nequipment sales, and expanding business segments.\nFinancial Highlights - Jamarson Kong\n[Slide 12] Thank you, Yinying, I’m Jamarson Kong - CFO of Fitell. I will review the fiscal year\nof 2023 financials with you and I will be available for the Q&A session if you have any questions.\nBefore I review the number, let me remind you that all figures I discuss are for this reporting period\n- fiscal year of 2023, unless I stated otherwise. Additionally, any year-over-year comparison is to\nJune 30 of 2022. Now, let’s go over our 2023 financial results.\n[Page 13] I will begin with an overview of our consolidated results on Slide 11. In the fiscal year\nof 2023, Fitell generated approximately 4.8 million in revenue. Our gross profit is about 2.2 million\nwith a net income of approximately -1.6 million. Our gross profit margin is fairly consistent with\nlast year’s, which is 45.3%. I will deep dive into each category and segment in the next slide.\n[Page 14] In this slide, I will dive deeper into the financial performance of each of our product\ncategories. Our revenue consists of 3 product categories: merchandise revenue, sales of\nconsumable products and revenue from licensing customers. Merchandise revenue represents the\nsales of our gym and fitness equipment products; consumable products are various lifestyle\nproducts; last but not least, licensing business include licensing and management consultant\nincome and agency fee for distributing other miscellaneous items.\nMerchandise revenue was about 4.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. It accounts\nfor approximately 84% of our total revenue. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease\nin sales order, which was due to the decrease of disposal income of Australian households caused\nby the inflation and increasing interest rate. In addition, there is also a slight decrease in the average\nrevenue per order.\n3\nConsumable products include, but not limited to, coffee and nutritional supplement products. The\nsales of consumable products were about 223 thousand in fiscal year 2023, which accounted for\nabout 4.7% of the total revenue. The sales of consumable products increased about 11.6%\ncompared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to our efforts in diversifying\nour revenue streams to mitigate the other negative effects.\nOur licensing business generated approximately 540 thousand, and it accounts for approximately\n11.2% of our total revenue. The decrease was mainly due to the temporary suspension of the\noverseas expansion plan due to the inflation and rising interest rates in global markets.\n[Page 15] Our growth in both number of customers and orders from FY2022 to FY2023 was\naffected by inflation and raising of interest rate in Australia. We have received about 15 thousands\norders and acquired approximately 23 thousand customers in 2023, an decrease of 42.6% and\n41.1%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2022. The average order value per sales order\nhave slightly decreased by 3% in FY2023 compared to FY2022. Members - 171,905 members by\nend of FY2023, compared to 167,264 members at the end of FY2022.\nDespite it was a challenging year with declining revenues for us, especially in the merchandise\nsales and licensing business segments, our management team remains dedicated to working\ntirelessly to promote our products and retain our loyal customers. Instead of being disheartened by\nthe setback because of the downfall of the global economic market, we have doubled down our\nefforts to promote business growth. We are committed to innovative strategies, market research\nand we will continue to expand the licensing business service again in the Asian market when we\nidentify the beneficial opportunities. We believe that the company will show resilience and reap\nthe rewards of growth and success in the near future.\n[Page 16] Next, I will go over the key subsequent event after our fiscal year 2023. On August 8,\n2023, we successfully listed on Nasdaq and raised a net proceeds of approximately $13.6 million\nfor the issuance of 3,000,000 shares of common stock. On October 23, the Board promoted\nYinying Lu, Fitell’s board of directors promoted general manager of GD Wellness, to CEO of the\nCompany. With that, I will now turn the call back to our investor relations - Yiru.\nQ&A Session\nThank you, Sam and Jamarson.
