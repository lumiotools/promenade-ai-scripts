However, pharmacological research in pregnant women is limited, and few clinical pharmacology models incorporate the dynamic physiological changes during pregnancy,” said Steven Ryder, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Rallybio. “The dose regimen identified through the modeling and simulation collaboration between Rallybio and our partners at Certara USA will now be evaluated in our recently initiated RLYB212 Phase 2 dose confirmation trial. Furthermore, this work is a meaningful step forward in using model-informed approaches to support not only the advancement of our RLYB212 program for prevention of maternal alloimmunization and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, or FNAIT, but also the development of monoclonal antibodies for use in pregnancy more broadly.” \n\nThe manuscript details the target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model, which simultaneously characterized the pharmacokinetics of RLYB212 and introduces a novel parameter to describe the pharmacodynamics of HPA-1a-positive platelet elimination. Prior to performing dose regimen simulations, additional model parameters related to clearance, volume and intercompartmental transfer rates were incorporated into the TMDD model to account for dynamic physiological changes associated with pregnancy. The model was then used to perform simulations to inform the dosing regimen for the RLYB212 Phase 2 dose confirmation trial in pregnant women at higher risk of HPA-1a alloimmunization and FNAIT. The complete article can be accessed [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1002%2Fpsp4.13250&esheet=54158169&newsitemid=20241125257302&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=1&md5=e1664a67ca1e55befee9ed1d4305582d). \n\nRallybio is developing RLYB212, a novel human monoclonal anti-HPA-1a antibody, to prevent alloimmunization in pregnant women and thereby eliminate the risk of FNAIT and its potentially devastating consequences in their fetuses and newborns. Rallybio recently announced the initiation of screening in its Phase 2 dose confirmation trial in pregnant women at higher risk for HPA-1a alloimmunization and FNAIT ([2024-512651-20](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Feuclinicaltrials.eu%2Fsearch-for-clinical-trials%2F%3Flang%3Den%26EUCT%3D2024-512651-20-00&esheet=54158169&newsitemid=20241125257302&lan=en-US&anchor=2024-512651-20&index=2&md5=98cbbdecedb89fab363cdd016fa468d6)/[NCT06435845](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06435845&esheet=54158169&newsitemid=20241125257302&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06435845&index=3&md5=34b46959e4c8d0a05cd1b0b1207589fb)). The Company is also conducting a non-interventional FNAIT natural history study that is designed to provide a contemporary dataset for HPA-1a alloimmunization frequency in a racially and ethnically diverse population. As of November 1, 2024, more than 13,000 pregnant women had been screened in this ongoing study. \n\n**About FNAIT**\n\nFetal and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a potentially life-threatening rare disease that can cause uncontrolled bleeding in fetuses and newborns. FNAIT can arise during pregnancy due to an immune incompatibility between an expectant mother and her fetus in a specific platelet antigen called human platelet antigen 1, or HPA-1. \n\nThere are two predominant forms of HPA-1, known as HPA-1a and HPA-1b, which are expressed on the surface of platelets. Individuals who are homozygous for HPA-1b, meaning that they have two copies of the HPA-1b allele and no copies of the HPA-1a allele, are also known as HPA-1a negative. Upon exposure to the HPA-1a antigen, these individuals can develop antibodies to that antigen in a process known as alloimmunization. In HPA-1a-negative expectant mothers bearing a HPA-1a-positive fetus, alloimmunization can occur upon mixing of fetal blood with maternal blood. When alloimmunization occurs in an expectant mother, the anti-HPA-1a antibodies that develop in the mother can cross the placenta and destroy platelets in the fetus. The destruction of platelets in the fetus can result in severely low platelet counts, or thrombocytopenia, and potentially lead to devastating consequences including miscarriage, stillbirth, death of the newborn, or severe lifelong neurological disability in those babies who survive. There is currently no approved therapy for the prevention or prenatal treatment of FNAIT. \n\n**About Rallybio**\n\nRallybio (NASDAQ: RLYB) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop and commercialize life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases.

With clinical trial application (CTA) approvals in-hand, our team is activating clinical sites, and we expect to initiate screening for pregnant women at higher risk for alloimmunization and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) in the coming weeks,” said Stephen Uden, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Rallybio. “Additionally, the focused investments in our RLYB116 program have delivered important data that we look forward to sharing in December along with next steps for the program. As a result of our refocused operating plan announced earlier this year, we have reduced our cash burn and we are on track to achieve all of our 2024 pipeline milestones. We will continue our strategy of focused investments which positions Rallybio to deliver multiple key value inflection points in 2025 and long-term value creation.” \n\n**Recent Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n**_RLYB212 Program_**\n\n  * Rallybio announced the approval of its CTAs for the RLYB212 Phase 2 dose confirmation trial in pregnant women at higher risk for HPA-1a alloimmunization and FNAIT. With these approvals from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), activation of clinical sites is underway and screening is on track to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n\n  * Screening continues in the Company's FNAIT natural history study, with more than 13,000 pregnant women screened as of November 1, 2024. Rallybio has now transitioned European sites from the natural history study to the Phase 2 trial, where the sites will continue to collect natural history data in those women at higher risk for HPA-1a alloimmunization who do not receive RLYB212. \n\n\n  * Results from the Phase 1b proof-of-concept study were published in _Thrombosis and Haemostasis_ in August 2024. Additional publications, including the rationale and modeling that support the RLYB212 Phase 2 dose regimen, are expected later this year. \n\n\n  * Data from a preclinical model demonstrating that prophylactic administration of RLYB212 safely and effectively prevents FNAIT in pregnant mice will be presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting being held December 7 – 10 in San Diego, CA.\n\n\n\n**_Title:_**_Prophylactic Administration of HPA -1a–Specific Antibody RLYB212 Safely Prevents Fetal/Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia in Pregnant Mice _**_Publication Number:_**_1185_** _Session Name: _**_311. Disorders of Platelet Number or Function: Clinical and Epidemiological: Poster I_** _Session Date:_**_Saturday, December 7, 2024 _**_Presentation Time:_**_5:30 PM - 7:30 PM _**_Location:_**_San Diego Convention Center , Halls G-H_\n\nThis poster was also selected for the ASH Poster Walk on _Hemostasis and Thrombosis: from Basic Concepts to Clinical Applications Hosted by Blood Vessels, Thrombosis & Hemostasis,_ which will take place on December 7 from 11:15 AM - 12:15 PM. \n\n  * Rallybio presented full data from an epidemiological analysis that provided the first robust evidence quantifying the proportion of women of non-Caucasian ancestries that carry the genetic markers for higher FNAIT risk (HPA-1a negative, HLA-DRB3*01:01 positive) at the NORD Rare Diseases and Orphan Products Breakthrough Summit, which was held October 20 – 22 in Washington D.C., and at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Annual Meeting, which is being held November 5 – 9 in Denver, CO. Based on the data, it is estimated that more than 30,000 pregnancies each year are at higher risk for FNAIT in North America and major European countries alone. \n\n\n\n**_RLYB116 Program_**\n\n  * RLYB116 manufacturing work was successfully completed in the third quarter of 2024. Rallybio expects that the process enhancements from this manufacturing work will improve the tolerability of RLYB116. \n\n\n  * Additional complement biomarker characterization has been completed. These results, when taken together with Phase 1 MAD data, indicate that RLYB116 led to greater sustained reductions in free C5 than initially understood. Based on these analyses, Rallybio believes that there is an opportunity to pursue indications beyond generalized myasthenia gravis, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and antiphospholipid syndrome at doses tested in the Phase 1 MAD study. \n\n\n  * In December 2024, Rallybio expects to provide updates on the manufacturing process enhancements and biomarker characterization as well as future plans for RLYB116. \n\n\n\n**_Preclinical Programs_**\n\nIn accordance with its 2024 operating plan, Rallybio is advancing its preclinical programs to important 2024 milestones. Beyond achievement of these milestones, Rallybio is seeking alternative options to further advance these programs, including partnerships and other forms of non-dilutive financing. \n\n  * **RLYB332:** Nonclinical data evaluating RLYB332, a long-acting version of the RLYB331 anti-matriptase-2 antibody, will be presented at the upcoming ASH Annual Meeting. \n\n\n\n**_Title:_**_Long-Acting Anti-Matriptase-2 Antibody as a Potentially Best-in-Class Therapy for Iron Overload Diseases_** _Publication Number:_**_3854_** _Session Name:_**_102. Iron Homeostasis and Biology: Poster III_** _Session Date:_**_ Monday, December 9, 2024 _**_Presentation Time:_**_ 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM _**_Location:_**_ San Diego Convention Center, Halls G-H_\n\n  * **ENPP1 Inhibitor, Exscientia Partnership: **Rallybio and Exscientia remain on track to nominate an ENPP1 inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) in December 2024. Data from an early lead ENPP1 inhibitor in a model of HPP was presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) meeting in September. The data demonstrated that oral dosing of REV101 to adult HPP mice lowered inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) by 30%, leading to improvements in mineralization of long and vertebrate bones. Furthermore, data showed that ENPP1 inhibition was safe and well-tolerated. Data also showed, for the first time, that ENPP1 is a druggable target for later-onset HPP. \n\n\n\n**_Corporate Updates_**\n\n  * Rallybio was named to the 2024 Fierce 50 List as an Innovation Honoree. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenue:** Revenue was $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to no revenue in the same period in 2023. The increase was related to Rallybio's entrance into the collaboration agreement with Johnson & Johnson in the second quarter of 2024 and the recognition of revenue related to the collaboration's performance obligations. \n\n\n  * **Research & Development (R&D) Expenses: **R&D expenses were $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to a decrease in development costs related to RLYB116 and RLYB212, in addition to a decrease in payroll and personnel-related costs, largely related to the workforce reduction and lower ongoing headcount in 2024 as compared to 2023. \n\n\n  * **General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses:** G&A expenses were $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $6.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily related to lower payroll and personnel-related costs, largely related to the workforce reduction and lower ongoing headcount in 2024 as compared to 2023, and reductions in other related general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in consulting fees. \n\n\n  * **Net Loss and Net Loss Per Common Share:** Rallybio reported a net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to a net loss of $18.4 million, or $0.45 per common share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n  * **Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $75.1 million. \n\n\n\n**About Rallybio **Rallybio (NASDAQ: RLYB) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop and commercialize life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases.
