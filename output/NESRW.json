(\"NESR\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:NESR)(NASDAQ:NESRW), a national, industry-leading provider of integrated energy services in the Middle East and North Africa (\"MENA\") region, today reported its financial results as of and for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. The Company posted the following results for the periods presented:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Variance**  \n---|---  \n(in thousands except per share amounts and percentages)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30 , ****2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **Sequential**| **Year-over-year**  \nRevenue| $| 336,205 | $| 324,969 | $| 300,084 | 3.5| %| 12.0| %  \nNet income| 20,618| 18,873| 14,731| 9.2| %| 40.0| %  \nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)*| 28,912| 27,356| 19,797| 5.7| %| 46.0| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)*| 80,035| 78,655| 70,885| 1.8| %| 12.9| %  \nDiluted EPS| 0.22| 0.20| 0.16| 10.0| %| 37.5| %  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS (non-GAAP)*| 0.31| 0.29| 0.21| 6.9| %| 47.6| %  \n  \n*The Company presents its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). However, management believes that using additional non-GAAP measures will enhance the evaluation of the profitability of the Company and its ongoing operations. Please see Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 below for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Interim Statements of Operations, and Condensed Consolidated Interim Statements of Cash Flows are derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements present in our Period Report on Form 6-K as of and for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\nStefan Angeli, Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"Despite a volatile macro environment and geopolitical headwinds in the region, NESR again achieved excellent results during the third quarter of 2024. We delivered record revenue of $336.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which was up 3.5% sequentially and up 12.0% year-over-year. We also reported record Adjusted EBITDA of $80.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, with margins of 23.8% substantially flat on a sequential quarter basis. Net cash provided by operating activities was $70.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $183.1 million for the year-to-date period. Free Cash Flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $43.4 million, $103.0 million for the year-to-date period, and was principally used to pay down bank debt. As a result of strong operating results and good cash flow conversion, we achieved a significant milestone at the end of the third quarter of 2024 where our Net Debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA fell below our annual goal of 1.0, ending at 0.96. Adjusted EPS was $0.31 for the third quarter of 2024 and $0.75 for the year-to-date period. Our return on capital employed on a trailing-twelve-months basis was 11%. Operational execution across the region continued to be strong in the third quarter of 2024 and our updated processes, procedures and controls have transformed the back office, helping to drive these results.\n\nDespite macro volatility, the MENA region remains favorable and NESR continues to be focused on its stated goals of delivering profitable revenue growth, execution efficiency, technology expansion and commercialization, and debt reduction and working capital efficiency, to drive future financial performance. On behalf of management, I would like to thank our entire workforce for their outstanding efforts in delivering these results, together with our directors, shareholders, and banking consortium for their continued support. The future continues to look good.\"\n\nSherif Foda, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Another solid quarter result underscores our ability to continue to outpace the market. The quarter was also a significant milestone on several fronts related to our marquee technology development initiatives, as highlighted at our recent board meeting in Saudi Arabia with visits to the Kingdom's state-of-the art Jafurah unconventional development. Our successful Roya run in Kuwait, the first such single-run execution in the country for NESR, is a strong indication of our commercial viability in this highly sophisticated directional drilling segment. Additionally, our recent investment in Salttech BV both highlights our confidence in the NEDA circular water & circular mineral thesis and is also backed by several successful pilot projects in the region with ambition to scale the solution.\"\n\n**Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Results** The Company had net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaling $20.6 million, an improvement of $5.9 million year-over-year. The change is largely attributable to increased activity in our principal areas and businesses of operations, particularly in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Adjusted net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $28.9 million and included adjustments totaling $8.3 million (\"Total Charges and Credits\"), mainly related to costs associated with the remediation of controls due to the restatement of our 2018-2020 financial statements, impairment charges from integrated production management investments, current expected credit loss provisions, and restructuring activities. A complete list of the adjusting items and the associated reconciliation from GAAP has been provided in Table 1 below in the section entitled \"Reconciliation of Net Income and Adjusted Net Income.\"\n\nThe Company reported $0.22 of diluted EPS for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted for the impact of Total Charges and Credits, Adjusted Diluted EPS, a non-GAAP measure described in Table 1 below, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, is $0.31.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Results** The Company generated Adjusted EBITDA of $80.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, improving 12.9% year-over-year and 1.8% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for certain Total Charges and Credits (those not related to interest, taxes, and/or depreciation and amortization). The Company posted the following results for the periods presented.\n\n(in thousands)| **Quarter ended****September 30, 2024**| **Quarter ended****June 30, 2024**| **Quarter ended****September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenue| $| 336,205| $| 324,969| $| 300,084  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 80,035| $| 78,655| $| 70,885  \n  \n**Balance Sheet** Cash and cash equivalents are $118.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $67.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $103.0 million, as compared to $74.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to improved operating results in 2024.\n\nTotal debt as of September 30, 2024, is $409.3 million with $125.1 million classified as short-term, as compared to $452.2 million and $120.6 million, respectively, on December 31, 2023. Net Debt (a non-GAAP measure), which is the sum of our recorded Current installments of long-term debt, Short-term borrowings, and Long-term debt less Cash and cash equivalents, totaled $291.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $384.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net Debt has decreased as compared to the prior period primarily due to long-term debt repayments during 2024. A reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measures to Net Debt is provided in Table 4 below, entitled \"Reconciliation to Net Debt.\"\n\n**Conference Call** A conference call is scheduled for 8:00 AM ET on November 19, 2024, to discuss the financial results.

AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES****(Unaudited)**(In US$ thousands except per share amounts)\n\nThe Company uses and presents certain key non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its business and trends, measure performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Included in this release are discussions of earnings before interest, income tax and depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain non-recurring and non-core expenses (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), net income and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") adjusted for certain non-recurring and non-core expenses (\"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted EPS,\" respectively), as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income and diluted EPS, respectively, in accordance with GAAP. The Company also discusses the non-GAAP balance sheet measure of the sum of our recorded current installments of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents (\"Net Debt\") in this release and provides a reconciliation to the GAAP measures of cash and cash equivalents, current installments of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt to Net Debt. The Company also discusses Free Cash Flow reconciled to Operating Cash Flow.\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS provides useful information to investors in assessing its financial performance and results of operations as the Company's board of directors, management and investors use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to compare the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of changes in capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), items that do not impact the ongoing operations (transaction, integration, and startup costs) and items outside the control of its management team. Similarly, Net Debt is used by management as a liquidity measure used to illustrate the Company's debt level absent variability in cash and cash equivalents, and the Company believes that the presentation of Net Debt provides useful information to investors in assessing its financial leverage. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income, or diluted EPS, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Net Debt also should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures of cash and cash equivalents, current installments of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. Finally, Free Cash Flow is used by management as a liquidity measure to illustrate the Company's ability to produce cash that is available to be distributed in a discretionary manner, after excluding investments in capital assets. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to Net cash provided by (used in) operations or Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**Table 1 - Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted EPS to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS**\n\n**Quarter ended****September 30, 2024**| **Quarter ended****June 30, 2024**| **Quarter ended****September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Net Income**| **Diluted EPS**| **Net Income**| **Diluted EPS**| **Net Income**| **Diluted EPS**  \n**Net Income**| **$**| **20,618**| **$**| **0.22**| **$**| **18,873**| **$**| **0.20**| **$**| **14,731**| **$**| **0.16**  \nAdd Charges and Credits:  \nCosts associated with the restatement of our 2018-2020 financial statements, including the SEC inquiry and remediation| 1,305| 0.01| 5,332| 0.06| 4,745| 0.05  \nImpairments| 1,583| 0.02| -| -| -| -  \nCurrent expected credit loss provisions| 652| 0.01| 2,720| 0.03| -| -  \nRestructuring projects| 4,188| 0.04| -| -| -| -  \nOther write-offs (recoveries) and provisions (release of provisions)| 566| 0.01| 431| -| 321| -  \n**Total Charges and Credits(1)**| **8,294**| **0.09**| **8,483**| **0.09**| **5,066**| **0.05**  \n**Total Adjusted Net Income**| **$**| **28,912**| **$**| **0.31**| **$**| **27,356**| **$**| **0.29**| **$**| **19,797**| **$**| **0.21**  \n(1)| In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Total Charges and Credits included $1.3 million of costs associated with the remediation of controls due to the restatement of our 2018-2020 financial statements, $1.6 million of impairment charges from integrated production management investments, $0.7 million of current expected credit loss provisions, $4.2 million of costs associated with restructuring projects, and $0.6 million of other write-offs (recoveries) and provisions (release of provisions).
