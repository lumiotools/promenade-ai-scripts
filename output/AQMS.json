Advance Financing and Commercial Agreements\n\nRENO, Nev., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS), a leader in sustainable lithium battery recycling, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided an update on its operations, commercial initiatives, and ongoing strategic financing efforts.\n\nThe past quarter has seen Aqua Metals make significant strides in producing high-purity lithium carbonate and conducting advanced due diligence processes with potential financing and commercial partners. The Company is focused on preparing its Sierra AquaRefining™ Campus (ARC) for commissioning, supported by a financing strategy designed to secure capital for the facility's full buildout in two phases, while also positioning the Company as a future-ready solution for cost-effective, environmentally sustainable battery recycling.\n\n**Recent Highlights and Progress:**\n\n**1. Pilot Facility Operations** Aqua Metals’ pilot facility has continued to demonstrate 24-hour operational capacity, producing high-purity, battery-grade lithium carbonate at over 99.5% purity. The Company believes it is the only recycler in the United States delivering kilogram quantities of battery-grade, recycled lithium carbonate. These consistent operations have enabled Aqua Metals to deliver samples to potential off-takers and battery manufacturers, demonstrating the quality of its recycled materials. The Company believes that the sustained 24-hour operations clearly demonstrate the scalability and reliability of Aqua Metals’ Li AquaRefining™ process, reinforcing the Company’s readiness to expand to commercial-scale recycling.\n\n**2. Strategic Financing and Commercial Initiatives** The Company is evaluating term sheets as it advances long-term financing and commercial supply and off-take partnerships. Aqua Metals’ management is actively engaged in due diligence to finalize these agreements, with anticipated milestones in the months ahead. The Company is in active discussions to secure strategic financing and additional commercial supply agreements that support its long-term growth objectives, enabling the efficient build-out of recycling capacity at the Sierra ARC.\n\n**3. Sierra ARC Development and Partner Engagement** While the Sierra ARC facility awaits final financing for completion, Aqua Metals has continued preparing the site for rapid commissioning, with structural and infrastructure upgrades already in place. The facility has hosted site visits from industry leaders, underscoring its preparedness for rapid equipment installation and commissioning upon securing necessary capital. Once funding is complete, the Company anticipates an accelerated turnaround of six to nine months to bring the facility into commercial operation, initially with a 3,000 tonne per year black mass processing capacity, with plans to expand to 10,000 tonnes.\n\n**4. Cost and Environmental Efficiency** Aqua Metals’ AquaRefining™ technology represents a next-generation recycling approach designed to eliminate the production of sodium sulfate, a costly byproduct of traditional recycling methods. Unlike other processes that require extensive chemical usage and lead to significant byproduct handling and disposal costs, AquaRefining™ is designed to reduce both expenses and environmental impact. This approach is intended to not only ensure a decarbonized, clean workplace but also result in millions of dollars in savings on chemical purchases, waste handling, and compliance each year as the Company reaches scale at the Sierra ARC.\n\n**Looking Ahead** Aqua Metals’ main priority is securing long-term funding to complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Sierra ARC facility, with commissioning expected within two to three quarters after securing capital. The facility site is prepped for a rapid buildout, with infrastructure in place to support an efficient, six to nine month timeline to operational readiness once funding is finalized.\n\nThe Company is also advancing commercial partnerships to ensure consistent feedstock supply and additional offtake customers, building on recent samples sent to OEMs and battery material companies. In parallel, pilot operations continue to validate AquaRefining™ technology, underscoring our commitment to efficient, low-cost, and sustainable recycling solutions.\n\nShareholders and the public can expect further updates on progress with secured funding, commercial partnerships, and operational milestones early in the new year as due diligence processes conclude. Aqua Metals remains committed to transparency and will continue to keep stakeholders informed as key milestones are achieved.\n\n“Our team has been hard at work, advancing key strategic partnerships and preparing the Sierra ARC for commercial deployment as we move forward with long-term financing and commercial discussions,” said Steve Cotton, President and CEO. “This quarter’s accomplishments and recent milestones showcase both the scalability of our technology and our commitment to building a financially resilient and environmentally sound recycling business. We’re encouraged by the validation from industry leaders and are fully focused on bringing the Sierra ARC online to drive sustainable growth in the U.S. battery materials supply chain.”\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** The Company will hold a conference call to discuss results and corporate developments today at 4:30 p.m. ET.

Business\nBackground\nWe were formed as a Delaware corporation on June 20, 2014, for the purpose of engaging in the business of recycling metals through a novel, proprietary and patent-\npending process that we developed and named “AquaRefining.” In 2015, Aqua Metals developed a breakthrough metal recycling technology that utilizes a clean, closed-\nloop process that can produce high-purity metal. We believe this innovative approach can deliver raw materials back into the manufacturing supply chain while reducing\nemissions and toxic byproducts and creating a safer work environment. In particular, the modular AquaRefining systems have already demonstrated the ability to recover\ncritical minerals from both lead acid batteries and lithium-ion batteries and can reduce the cost and environmental impact of battery recycling.\nAqua Metals has a history of battery recycling, having first owned and operated a pilot lead acid battery recycling facility between 2017 and 2019. This breakthrough\ntechnology was initially applied in the lead acid battery (LAB) recycling industry, building the first integrated recycling system for breaking LAB and recovering pure metal.\nIn 2019, we operated our demonstration AquaRefinery at commercial quantity production levels and produced over 35,000 ‘AquaRefined’ ingots operating twenty-four\nhours a day, seven days a week for sustained periods of time.\nIn February 2021, we announced our entry into the lithium-ion battery (LiB) recycling market through a key provisional patent we filed that applies the same\ninnovative AquaRefining approach. In August 2021, we announced we had established our Innovation Center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) focused on\napplying our proven technology to LiB recycling research, development and prototyping. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical\nand electrochemical recycling experience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to\nelectric vehicles; growth in Internet data centers; and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage.\nDuring the first half of 2022, we announced our ability to recover copper, lithium hydroxide, nickel, cobalt and manganese dioxide from lithium-ion battery ‘black\nmass’ at bench scale at the Company’s Innovation Center. During 2022, we built our fully-integrated pilot system, located within the Company’s Innovation Center, which\nis designed to enable Aqua Metals to be the first company in North America to recycle battery minerals from black mass, sell them in the U.S. and position the Company as\nthe first sustainable LiB recycler in North America to align with the U.S. government’s goal of retaining strategic battery minerals within the domestic supply chain.\nDuring 2022, we conducted environmental comparisons based on Argonne National Lab’s modeling of lithium battery supply chains – called EverBatt. The initial\nresults indicate that AquaRefining is a cleaner and more sustainable approach to LiB recycling, producing far less CO2 waste streams than smelting or chemical-driven\nhydrometallurgical processes currently on the market. In December 2022, we completed equipment installation and began to operate our first-of-a-kind LiB recycling\nfacility, utilizing renewable electricity as the reagent to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. In January of 2023, Aqua\nMetals recovered its first metals from recycling lithium batteries using the patent-pending Li AquaRefining process.\nIn February 2023, we acquired a five-acre recycling campus at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC). When fully developed, the facility we envision is\ndesigned to process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material each year using our proprietary Li AquaRefining technology. Subject to our receipt of the required\nadditional capital, we expect to complete development of phase one, including all equipment installation, by mid-2024 and to commence the commissioning and operation at\nthe new campus in the second half of 2024. The Company is planning for a phased development of the campus, beginning with the already commenced redevelopment of an\nexisting building on-site into the first commercial-scale Li AquaRefinery, targeting 3,000 tons per annum (tpa) capacity in phase one. In January through March of 2024, we\nhave made significant progress on the construction of the planned first phase of the commercial Li AquaRefinery.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms “Aqua Metals,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Aqua Metals, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nAll references in this report to “ton” or “tonne” refer to a metric ton, which is equal to approximately 2,204.6 pounds.\n2\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nAqua Metals is seeking to reinvent metal recycling with its patented and patent-pending AquaRefining™ technologies. Aqua Metals is focused on developing cleaner\nand safer metals recycling through innovation. We believe Aqua Metals can expand the development of breakthrough technologies for sustainable metal recycling and\ndeliver high-value critical minerals back into the manufacturing supply chain while reducing emissions and toxic byproducts and creating much safer work environments.\nAqua Metals has invested in breakthrough metals recycling methodologies that we believe are environmentally responsible, economically competitive, and will help\nretain critical strategic metals within the U.S. while enabling domestically produced, sustainably produced, recycled metals to enter the supply chain and lower sole reliance\non unsafe and toxic mining operations. Since 2015, Aqua Metals has developed breakthrough metal recycling technologies that utilize a clean, closed-loop process that can\nproduce ultra-high purity metals. AquaRefining is designed to deliver raw materials back into the manufacturing supply chain, and replaces the need for polluting furnaces\nand hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and\nminimal waste.\nWe believe Aqua Metals' regenerative electro-hydrometallurgical recycling method potentially offers a substantial improvement over traditional pyrometallurgical\nand hydrometallurgical recycling techniques, which produce much higher emissions, lower recovery rates, and significant landfill waste. We believe the AquaRefining\nprocess has the potential to vastly reduce the environmental impact of recycling lithium batteries as compared to other processes while providing a higher yield of high-\npurity metals essential for the burgeoning US battery manufacturing industry.\nWe are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals from lithium-ion batteries, with\nlower waste streams and lower costs than alternatives. With the proven ability to recover valuable metals from lithium-ion batteries at our pilot facility in the TRIC, our goal\nis to demonstrate our ability to process commercial quantities of high-purity lithium hydroxide and/or carbonate, nickel, cobalt, manganese dioxide, and copper in pure\nforms that can be sold to the general metals and superalloy markets, and can be made into battery precursor compound materials with proven processes that are already used\nin the battery industry.\nThe Company is also exploring additional novel applications of AquaRefining across metals recycling industries at our Innovation Center, including recycling\nemerging battery chemistries and opportunities to develop additional products for sale to customer specifications.\nOur Markets\nAqua Metals’ AquaRefining process produces high purity metals and alloys that can be returned into the battery manufacturing supply chain or sold into metals\nmarkets for use across various advanced manufacturing industries. This combination of approaches and the broad applicability of the end products we aim to produce\nenables Aqua Metals to create low-emissions inputs for the battery supply chain or to help decarbonize other sectors that utilize these critical metals and superalloys –\ncreating a more resilient and adaptable business model for the Company as a whole.\nMetals Markets\nMost of the minerals and metals that can be recovered in the recycling of batteries of various chemistries are also globally traded commodities. Lead, copper, cobalt,\nnickel, and other metals can be recovered and sold in pure metal form into these markets at the prevailing price or sold directly to a customer at a price set relative to the\ncurrent market price.\nFor example, battery metals are globally traded metal commodities. Metals such as lead for LABs and nickel, cobalt, copper and lithium for LIBs are the essential\ncomponents for the world’s rechargeable batteries. These metals are globally traded primarily on the London Metals Exchange (LME and the Shanghai Metals Exchange\n(SHME) in China also trades these elements. In their pure forms, the other minerals that Aqua Metals intends to recover from spent batteries can be sold into these global\nmarkets. Unlike lead markets where recycled mineral content achieves up to 90% of new LAB batteries in a mature industry, lithium and related metals recycling currently\nachieves only 1-3% recycled mineral content of new LiB batteries, relying almost entirely on newly mined ore and refining to meet global demand.\nAs noted above, although metals are traded as a commodity on the various global exchanges, the major sales are directly between producers/traders and users (whom\nare typically battery manufacturers). The LME daily price is used as the benchmark in forming the basis of physical trades, forward contracts, and hedge strategies for both\nprimary and secondary metals, in metal form. Based on market and product knowledge with buyers of metals in the U.S. and global metals markets, different grades (termed\nalloys) of metal are traded at a premium to the base LME price. Metal alloys, which are typically designed specifically for the customer, are also sold at a premium above the\nbase LME, whereas byproducts (generally lower purity, compounds, or scrap) are traded at a discount to the LME as they are based on the underlying metals content and its\nform.\n3\nTable of Contents\nLead Acid Batteries\nAccording to Grand View Research, annual lead acid battery sales are expected to grow to $84 billion by 2025, driving demand for lead. Similar prospects for healthy\ngrowth in the lead industry continue to be published and support continued growth in demand for lead for at least the next 15 years. We believe that grid storage and other\nenergy storage applications linked to renewable energy (solar and wind) will also generate increased demand for LABs, where low cost, safety and reliability will make them\nattractive options.\nThe increase in LAB manufacturing in general and particularly in China, India, and Southeast Asia, has increased demand for lead, putting pressure on global\nrecycling networks to meet this demand. At present, we believe that much of the LAB recycling performed outside of the U.S., Canada, the EU, Japan, and Australia is\ncarried out in outdated facilities with poor environmental standards and insufficient enforcement. China, India, Pakistan, and South America appear to be moving toward\ntougher regulation and enforcement. Even the cleanest incumbent lead recycling operations produce more pollution and worker safety challenges than our lead\nAquaRefining alternative. We believe that further aging of incumbent facilities coupled with ever tightening pollution and worker safety regulations will drive a demand in\nall markets for less polluting LAB recycling processes.\nThe Lithium Battery Market\nGlobal demand for Li-ion batteries is expected to soar over the next decade, with the number of GWh required increasing from about 700 GWh in 2022 to around 4.7\nTWh by 2030 (Figure 1 below). Batteries for mobility applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs), will account for the vast bulk of demand in 2030—about 4,300 GWh; an\nunsurprising trend seeing that mobility is growing rapidly. This is largely driven by three major drivers:\n● A regulatory shift toward sustainability, which includes new net-zero targets and guidelines, including Europe’s “Fit for 55” program, the US Inflation\nReduction Act, the 2035 ban of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the EU and in the State of California in the U.S., and India’s Faster Adoption and\nManufacture of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles Scheme.\n● Greater customer adoption rates and increased consumer demand for greener technologies (up to 90 percent of total passenger car sales will involve EVs in\nselected countries by 2030).\n● Announcements by 13 of the top 15 OEMs to discontinue production of ICE vehicles and achieve new emission-reduction targets.\nFigure 1: Growth of the Li-ion Battery Market Battery\nBattery energy storage systems (BESS) are expected to have a CAGR of 30 percent, and the GWh required to power these applications in 2030 will be comparable to\nthe GWh needed for all applications today. China could account for 45 percent of total Li-ion demand in 2025 and 40 percent in 2030—most battery-chain segments are\nalready mature in that country. Nevertheless, growth is expected to be highest globally in the EU and the United States, driven by recent regulatory changes, as well as a\ngeneral trend toward localization of supply chains. In total, at least 120 to 150 new battery factories will need to be built between now and 2030 globally to have sufficient\ncapacity to meet predicted demand. In line with the surging demand for Li-ion batteries across industries, it is projected that revenues along the entire value chain will\nincrease 5-fold, from about $85 billion in 2022 to over $400 billion in 2030 (Figure 2). Active materials and cell manufacturing may have the largest revenue pools. Mining\nis not the only option for sourcing battery materials since recycling is also an option. Although the recycling segment is expected to be relatively small in 2030, it is\nprojected to grow more than three-fold in the following decade, when more batteries reach their end-of-life and greater quantities of manufacturing scrap material become\navailable for recycling.\n4\nTable of Contents\nFigure 2: Li-ion Revenue Opportunities through 2030\nLithium Batteries\nEV batteries are powered by a battery pack made up of individual cells. Each cell has 4 components: the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. Lithium-ion\nbatteries use different raw materials for each of the components. The most common material used for the anode is graphite. The most widely used metals for the cathode is\nmetal oxides that are combinations of lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and aluminum. The electrolyte is generally made using acidic salts and solvents such as sulfuric\nacid and there are also solid-state silicon-based alternatives under development and early deployments have begun. The separator is usually created using a porous,\npolyolefin material like polyethylene or polypropylene.\nLithium-ion battery recycling is the method of taking EV batteries and splitting it into its components, ultimately into the original raw materials (lithium, nickel,\ncobalt, etc.) that can be reused in new batteries. While making lithium-ion batteries for EVs is important to address climate change, the batteries themselves are harmful\nto the environment if left in landfills or burned. Currently, only a small fraction of lithium-ion batteries are recycled and that must get close to 100% both to\navoid environmental issues and to recapture the critical minerals in those spent batteries to feed the massive demand growth curve. Battery recycling helps address this\nproblem, but current pyro-based battery recycling technology (smelting) also creates harmful emissions, potentially creating new climate problems faster than they are being\nsolved. There are alternative hydro-based technologies available and rely on older methodologies that are known to create significant waste streams, potentially with more\nwaste than product recovered, which have their own negative environmental and economic impacts.\nBlack Mass\nLithium-ion batteries are comprised of valuable metals such as lithium, copper, manganese, cobalt, and nickel. Once a battery is retired, the batteries can be collected,\nfully discharged, then shredded and base metals are separated to prepare them for recycling. This shiny, metallic mixture is what is called ‘black mass’—and it contains all\nthe valuable metals that make up battery anodes and cathodes, the most expensive parts of a battery and the companies that collect and process batteries into black mass\nare referred to as ‘shredders’. The typical black color is due to the high concentrations of graphite contained in the anodes of batteries, which has a very dark black color.\nBlack mass makes up about 40-50% of the total weight of an EV battery. Materials like the binder, copper, electrolytes, plastics, aluminum, and steel have been physically\nseparated out by shredders before being recycled.\n5\nTable of Contents\nThere are two main processes to producing black mass:\n1. Pyrometallurgy: some black mass producers will use high temperatures to burn off unwanted materials like plastics and remaining electrolyte. This can create\nhazardous emissions and waste that must be captured or mitigated, and result in less recovered material.\n2. Hydrometallurgy: many producers use solution-based techniques—using water, chemicals and electricity to crush and separate the materials from a battery.\nThis eliminates the need for polluting furnaces and energy intensive processing, creating a lower-carbon black mass.\nAqua Metals specifically partners with producers that use non-pyro processes in order to create black mass to meet their own objectives for creating low-carbon recycled\nmaterials. The exact composition of black mass can vary considerably based on a number of factors. To start, there are many different types of lithium-ion batteries and\nmanufacturing scrap forms, which will revert back to a mix of different elements and different ratios, including lithium, nickel, iron, titanium, copper, cobalt, manganese,\nand others (their use of lithium is the commonality).\nEach manufacturer also has their own specific ‘recipe’ for their cathodes, cell type/form factors, as well as module type and pack assembly for different applications\n(cell phones, laptops, electric vehicles, etc.). Currently, the most popular types of lithium-ion batteries in the world incorporate significant amounts of nickel, cobalt, lithium,\nand manganese—so black mass produced today will typically have varying concentrations of each.\nAquaRefining Process\nWe developed AquaRefining to be a cleaner and modular alternative to smelting and chemical-based recycling methods. Our process has two key elements, both of\nwhich are integral to our issued patents and pending-patent applications. The first is our use of proprietary, non-toxic solvents that dissolves metal compounds. The second is\na proprietary electrochemical process and our modular Aqualyzer cells that selectively target each critical element and converts the dissolved metal compounds into high\npurity metals and/or salts.\nThe AquaRefining process begins with the processing of crushed used batteries either in the form of paste (for LAB) or, black mass (for LIB). The active materials\nare first processed to remove sulfur and then dissolved in our solvent. Metals are plated from the solvent using our patented and patent-pending process allowing the solvent\nto be reused.\nWe have demonstrated at bench scale and subsequently in our pilot facility that our lithium battery AquaRefining process can generate cobalt, lithium hydroxide or\ncarbonate, copper, nickel, and manganese dioxide from lithium-ion battery black mass. A significant benefit of our AquaRefining process is that it can produce higher yields\nof higher purity, and thus higher value product than that derived from primary smelters with product from secondary sources.\nAnother significant benefit of our process is that we designed our AquaRefining equipment to be manufactured on a purpose-built production line in standard sized\nAqualyzers. This is not possible with the smelting process, as smelters need to be constructed on site. This gives us the ability to provide AquaRefining systems with varying\ncapacities to meet the specific needs of potential customers and suppliers. We have also developed an integrated software and portal called PureMetrics that keeps track of\nproduction and key operating metrics.\nRecycling is subject to a variety of domestic and international regulations related to hazardous materials, emissions, employee safety and other matters. While our\noperations will be subject to these regulations, we believe that one of our potential advantages will be our ability to conduct battery recycling operations with less regulatory\ncost and burden than smelting operators due to the nature of our process. One of our key initiatives is and will continue to be, to educate regulators and the public as to the\nenvironmental benefits of AquaRefining. We believe that we have the potential to develop a business model that offers the opportunity to conduct, in an environmentally\nfriendly manner, an important recycling activity that historically has been conducted in an often highly polluting manner.\n6\nTable of Contents\nProject Site\nAqua Metals is in the process of building a new lithium-ion battery recycling facility to be located within Storey County, Nevada (the “Project”). The Project\nis located at 2955 & 2999 Waltham Way, McCarran, NV 89434 (the “Commercial Facility”). Aqua Metals operates a demonstration scale facility at 60 Denmark Drive,\nMcCarran, NV 89434 (the “Innovation Center”) which utilizes the equivalent equipment and technology as is expected to be constructed and operated in the Project.\nFigure 3: Aqua Metals Site Rendering\nHighlights include:\n● Five-acre campus designed to ultimately process more than 20 million pounds of lithium-ion battery material annually (10,000tpa)\n● Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center campus at the heart of Nevada’s lithium battery supply chain\n● Foreign Trade Zone designation\n● Rendering of existing building and additional land available for future expansion\nBlack mass materials secured to reach commercial scale in 2024, and operate into 2025.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur Business Model\nAqua Metals is engaged in the business of applying its commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles to develop the clean and cost-efficient\nrecycling solutions for both lead and lithium-ion (“Li”) batteries. Our recycling process is a patented hydrometallurgical and electrochemical technology that is a novel,\nproprietary and patented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that replaces polluting\nfurnaces and hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions,\nand with minimal waste. The “Aqualyzers” cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage\neconomy.\nWe are applying our sustainable recycling technology principles with the goal of developing the cleanest and most cost-efficient recycling solution for lithium-ion\nbatteries. We believe our process has the potential to produce higher quality products at a lower operating cost without the damaging effects of furnaces and greenhouse\nemissions. We expect to recover lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate, copper, nickel, cobalt, and other compounds in a salable form to either be sold directly to\nlithium battery CAM manufactures or the commodities market. Aqua Metals estimates the total addressable market for lithium-ion battery recycling will be approximately\n$9 billion by 2025 and grow to exceed lead battery recycling by the end of the decade. Unlike the mature lead recycling market, the deployed lithium-ion battery recycling\ninfrastructure to serve market growth does not exist today.\nOur business strategy is based on the pursuit of building and operating Li AquaRefining recycling capacity to meet the growing demand for critical metals in lithium-\nion batteries driven by innovations in automobile batteries, growth in internet data centers, and alternative energy applications, including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage.\nWe are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining, which is fundamentally non-polluting, can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered\nminerals from lithium-ion batteries with lower waste streams and lower costs than existing alternatives. Throughout 2023 and now into 2024, we have demonstrated at our\npilot facility our ability to recover key valuable minerals in lithium-ion batteries, such as lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate, copper, nickel, cobalt, and other\ncompounds. Our goal is to process commercial quantities of nickel, cobalt, and copper in a pure metal form that can be sold to the general metals and superalloy markets and\ncan be made into battery precursor compound materials with known processes already used in the mining industry. We have operated the first Li AquaRefining pilot plant\nthroughout 2023. The location for the pilot demonstration facility is currently the Innovation Center with expansion to happen at our new 5-acre recycling campus to\ncommercial quantities. Once fully completed, our commercial facility is designed to process ~10,000 tonnes / year or more of battery materials, with our first phase, which\nwould be enough material to build ~100,000 average EVs or ~400,000 average home energy storage systems. We are proceeding with a phased development approach, and\ncommenced phase one of our campus in 2023, with a target capacity of 3,000 tonnes per year.\nOur focus for the lithium market includes operating our first-of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical\nprocesses, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. We are also exploring partnership and/or joint venture agreements, particularly as our Li AquaRefining matures. We\nbelieve that Aqua Metals is in a position to become one of the few critical minerals recovery players for which our environmental and economic value proposition should\ngenerate both great commercial wins and potentially government grants to accelerate our expansion and progress.\nThe market for lithium-ion batteries is global in scale but local in nature and execution, with large differences in local regulation, custom and practice, and access to\ntransportation and electricity costs. In some regions, it is highly regulated, and in others it is not. Consequently, we are evolving our business model to commercialize our\ntechnology optimally across multiple locations.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nOur development of recycling technology for lithium-ion batteries is a unique approach to extracting the high-value metals compared to the array of other potential\nsolutions under development. Currently, smelting is the only commercially proven process for recycling lithium-ion batteries. The smelting process utilizes multiple high\nemissions steps with low yields to produce materials that typically require further refining before being utilized to manufacture new batteries. Over the next decade and\nbeyond, when the volume of used batteries becomes significant, smelting will likely not be a viable solution due to the negative environmental impact and likelihood of\nregulatory restrictions on emissions. The other technologies currently under development utilize a predominately hydrometallurgical approach that consumes significant\namounts of chemicals to extract the metals resulting in high cost and excessive waste streams. Our approach is a hybrid of hydrometallurgical and electrometallurgical\nprocesses like the process we have commercialized for lead, we call it “Li AquaRefining.” We believe, and our lab scale and then bench scale and now pilot scale R&D\nsupports, that Li AquaRefining requires less chemicals, produces less waste streams, and creates higher purity products at a lower cost as compared to both smelting and\nstandard hydrometallurgy.\nThe lithium-ion battery recycling market is significantly different from that of the lead recycling market in that it is a nascent industry. With no predominant\ntechnology to displace, our goal is to enable new and existing recyclers across the globe with Li AquaRefining as a best-in-class solution for meeting the supply chain\ndemands of the lithium-ion battery industry as well as meeting the environmental needs of the planet and the corporations seeking to achieve net zero emissions.\nThe competitive advantages of the Aqua Metals project include:\n● Replaces furnaces and heavy chemical use with 100% electricity-powered and closed-loop recycling, creating fundamentally non polluting, cost-efficient\nsolution that generates minimal waste\n● AquaRefining recovers all valuable materials, including Lithium Hydroxide, Lithium Carbonate, and Manganese Dioxide, which are not recovered by\ncompeting methods\n● Recovers the high-value metals lost in smelting (like lithium and manganese), and produces high purity products\n● Only Li-ion recycling method with pathway to net-zero operations\n● Strong IP protection: 73 global patents; 43 patents pending\n● Only electro-hydrometallurgy recycler in North America\n● Safer work environment, less hazardous materials, eliminates constant trainloads of chemicals\n● Massive and growing global addressable market\n● Greenfield opportunity for partnerships and strategic alliances\nIntellectual Property Rights\nWe regard the protection of our technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We\nendeavor to generate and protect our intellectual property assets through a series of patents, trademarks, internal and external policy and procedures and contractual\nprovisions.\nPatent Portfolio\nCurrently, we have secured 3 US patents, 32 international patents, and 3 allowances (international). In addition to the US patents, we have international\npatents/allowances in the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, African Intellectual Property Organization, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the\nEurasian Patent Organization, European Union, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Korea, South Africa, Ukraine, and Vietnam. We also have\n32 US and foreign patent applications pending with patent applications pending in 16 additional non-US jurisdictions, across six distinct patent applications relating to\ncertain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. The claims of the granted patents substantially\naddress the same subject matter and are drawn to various aspects of processing lead or lithium materials using an aqua refining process. Differences in the claim number and\nscope are due to local rules and practice as well as the target metal.\nWe intend to continue to prepare and file domestic and foreign patent applications covering expanding aspects and applications of our technology, as circumstances\nwarrant.\nThere can be no assurance that any patents will issue from any of our current or any future applications. Also, any patents that may issue may not survive a legal\nchallenge to their scope, validity, or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. Competitors may work around our patents, so they are not infringing. Our patent\nportfolio and our existing policy and procedures safeguarding our trade secrets nonetheless may face challenges so that our competitors can copy our AquaRefining process.\nTrademark Portfolio\nWe have filed for trademark registration in the US and foreign countries for the following trademarks:\n• AQUA METALS (11 foreign countries)\n• AQUAREFINING (10 foreign countries)\n• AQMS (US only)\n• AQUAREFINERY (9 foreign countries)\nTrade Secrets and Contract Protection\nWe have developed our internal policy and procedures in safeguarding our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our procedures generally require our\nemployees, consultants, and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the\nindividual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the\ncase of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology that is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The\ndevelopment of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience, and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations and the operations of our licensees in the United States will be subject to the federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable\nto the reclamation of LABs and lithium based batteries. While the reclamation process itself is generally not subject to federal permitting requirements, depending on how\nany particular operation is structured, our facilities and the facilities of our licensees may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals from federal, state or local\nregulators to operate, including permits or regulatory approvals related to air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and the storage of batteries on-site should that\nbecome necessary. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our or our licensee's facilities. Failure to secure\n(or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial\nresults, and growth prospects.\nIn addition to permitting requirements, our operations and the operations of our licensees are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and\nregulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead, acids, and other metals involved in reclamation. These include hazard\ncommunication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead.\nFailure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business.\nChanges to these regulatory requirements in the future could also increase our costs, require changes in or cessation of certain activities, and adversely affect the business.\nThe nature of our operations and the operations of our licensees involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could\nresult in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other\nenvironmental liability. Our operations and the operations of our licensees also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead, acids, and other metals related to\nlithium batteries into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have\nbeen released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially\nresponsible. Like any manufacturer, we and our licensees are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that\nwere sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,\nas amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of\nthe conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability\nfor the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.\nAs our business expands outside of the United States, our licensed operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we\ndo business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements\nsuch as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could\nbe less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as South America, Taiwan and China, the relevant\nenvironmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Therefore, while compliance with these requirements will cause our business to\nincur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business, it is difficult to evaluate such potential costs or adverse impacts until such\ntime as we decide to initiate operations in particular countries outside the United States.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this report, we employ 53 people on a full-time basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.\nFinancial and Segment Information\nWe operate our business as a single segment, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial information is included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.aquametals.com and our investor relations website is located at https://ir.aquametals.com/.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should read and consider carefully the following risk\nfactors as well as all other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Each of these risk factors, either\nalone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common\nstock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial, which could also impair our business and financial\nposition. If any of the events described below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of operations and/or our future\ngrowth prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. As a result, you could lose some or all of any\ninvestment you may make in our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history and limited revenue producing operations and are currently undertaking a reset of our business strategy . Therefore, it is\ndifficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. We formed our corporation in June 2014. From inception through December 31, 2023, we generated a total of\n$11.7 million of revenue, all of which was derived primarily from the sale of lead compounds and plastics and, to a lesser extent, the sale of lead bullion and AquaRefined\nlead, and all but approximately $310,000 of which was derived prior to January 1,2020 at our former LAB recycling facility. In the last two years, the business has been\nfocused on completing the research and development of the application of our AquaRefining technology to the recycling of lithium-ion batteries and operating a lithium-\nion recycling pilot plant. Based upon our success to date in recovering high value metals from lithium-ion batteries using our AquaRefining technology, we have commenced\nthe development of a five-acre recycling campus designed to process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material annually. While we intend to continue to pursue our\nlicensing business model, the development of our lithium-ion battery recycling facility represents a significant change in our business strategy and course of operations. As\nof the date of this report, we estimate that we will begin to realize revenues from lithium-ion battery recycling in 2024, however we are unable to estimate when we expect to\ncommence any meaningful commercial or revenue producing operations from either our licensing model or our lithium-ion battery recycling facility. Our limited operating\nhistory makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations and we are, for all practical purposes, an early-stage company subject to\nall the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications, and delays in a new business, including, without limitation:\n• our ability to successfully apply, and realize the expected benefits of applying, our AquaRefining technology to the plating of high value metals found in lithium-ion\nbatteries, including cobalt, nickel, and copper;\n• the timing and success of our plan of commercialization and the fact that we have not entered into a commercial license for our AquaRefining technology and only\nhave recently commenced the build out of our lithium-ion recycling facility;\n• our ability to successfully develop our proposed lithium-ion recycling facility;\n• our ability to demonstrate that our AquaRefining technology can recycle either LABs or lithium-ion batteries on a commercial scale; and\n• our ability to license our AquaRefining process and sell our AquaRefining equipment to recyclers of LABs and lithium-ion batteries.\nInvestors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no\nassurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nWe will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at\nall. As of December 31, 2023, we had total cash of $16.5 million and working capital of $13.7 million. As of the date of this report, we believe that we will require\nadditional capital in order to fund our current level of ongoing costs and our proposed business plan over the next 12 months as we move forward with our business strategy.\nWe intend to acquire the necessary capital though debt financing or through the sale of equity. Funding that includes the sale of our equity may be dilutive. If such funding\nis not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your\nentire investment.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023 states that there is substantial doubt about our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\nWe recently commenced the development of a lithium-ion recycling facility, however we are in the early stages of developing the facility and there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to successfully develop the facility or, if we do, realize the expected benefits of the facility. In January 2023, we announced our plans to\nconduct the phased development of a five-acre recycling campus in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, or TRIC, in McCarran, Nevada. The facility is designed, when fully\ndeveloped, to process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material each year using our proprietary AquaRefining technology. On February 1, 2023, we closed on the\nacquisition financing and purchased the five-acre site, plus the existing 21,000 square foot building, and as noted elsewhere, in third quarter of 2023 we raised a net of\n$22.9 million from the sale of our common stock. We believe the net proceeds will allow us to commence the Phase One build-out of the facility. However, we will need\nadditional financing to complete the build-out of Phase One, which we intend to pursue through conventional non-dilutive loans, potential government backed debt\nofferings, government grants or through the sale of our common stock via our current at-the-market offering. Subject to our receipt of development financing on a timely\nbasis, we expect to complete development of Phase One, including all equipment installation, by the end of first half of 2024 and to commence operations at the new campus\nin the second half of 2024. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.\nOur business is dependent upon our successful implementation of novel technologies and processes and there can be no assurance that we will be able to\nimplement such technologies and processes in a manner that supports the successful commercial roll-out of our business model. While much of the technology and\nprocesses involved in battery recycling operations are widely used and proven, our AquaRefining process is largely novel and, to date, has been demonstrated on a modest\nscale of operations. While we have shown that our proprietary technology can produce AquaRefined metals from batteries on a small scale, we have not processed recycled\nbatteries on a commercial scale. We recently commenced the development of a five-acre recycling campus designed to process lithium-ion batteries, however there can be\nno assurance that we will be able to complete the development of the recycling facility or, if we are able to do so, that we will be able to successfully process lithium-ion\nbatteries on a commercial scale. In this regard, as we developed our LAB recycling facility at TRIC during 2018 and 2019, there can be no assurance that we will not\nencounter unforeseen complications as we pursue our revised business model.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur business model is new and has not been proven by us or anyone else. We are engaged in the business of producing recycled lead from LABs and high value\nmetals from lithium-ion batteries through a novel, and proven on a modest scale, technology. While the production of recycled batteries is an established business, to date\nvirtually all recycled metals have been produced by way of traditional smelting processes. To our knowledge, no one has successfully produced recycled batteries in\ncommercial quantities other than by way of smelting. In addition, neither we nor anyone else has ever successfully built a production line that commercially recycles\nbatteries without smelting. Further, there can be no assurance that either we will be able to produce AquaRefined metals from batteries in commercial quantities at a cost of\nproduction that will provide us with an adequate profit margin. The uniqueness of our AquaRefining process presents potential risks associated with the development of a\nbusiness model that is untried and unproven.\nWe have initiated the research and development of the application of our AquaRefining technology to the recycling and recovery of lithium-ion batteries,\nhowever there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. In September 2021, we announced the establishment of our Innovation Center, in McCarran,\nNevada, focused on applying our AquaRefining technology to lithium-ion battery recycling research and development and prototype system activities. In 2021, we filed a\nprovisional patent for recovering high-value metals from recycled lithium-ion batteries to complement the patents for AquaRefining. At the end of 2022 and\nthroughout 2023, we successfully recovered all valuable materials from spent lithium batteries at production scale using our AquaRefining technology: lithium hydroxide,\ncopper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese dioxide. We also operated our pilot plant throughout 2023. We are continuing our efforts to improve our Li AquaRefining process;\nhowever, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to conduct the recycling and recovery of the high value metals from lithium-ion\nbatteries on a commercial scale.\nOur business strategy includes licensing arrangements and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances, however as of the date of this report we have no\nsuch agreements in place and there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to successfully integrate such licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or\nstrategic alliances into our operations could adversely affect our business. We propose, as one of our business strategies, to commercially exploit our AquaRefining\nprocess by licensing our technology to third parties and entering into joint ventures and strategic relationships with parties involved in the manufacture and recycling\nof batteries. We are also currently seeking to negotiate agreements with others. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to conclude a licensing agreement with\nany partners, or that we will be able to do so on terms that benefit us. In 2023, we exited our proposed collaboration with LINICO by way of the sale of our\nLINICO common stock to LINICO’s parent, Comstock Inc., and we ceased the development of recycling operations at the Taiwan facilities of ACME Metals. Our ability to\nenter into licensing, joint ventures and strategic relationships with third parties will depend on our ability to demonstrate the technological and commercial advantages of our\nAquaRefining process, of which there can be no assurance. Also, even if we are able to enter into licensing, joint venture or strategic alliance agreements, there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to obtain the expected benefits of any such arrangements. In addition, licensing programs, joint ventures and strategic alliances may involve\nsignificant other risks and uncertainties, insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the transaction, potential additional\nchallenges in protecting our intellectual property, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, such as product quality, technology issues and legal\ncontingencies. In addition, we may be unable to effectively integrate any such programs and ventures into our operations. Our operating results could be adversely affected\nby any problems arising during or from any licenses, joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nEven if our licensees are successful in recycling batteries using our processes, there can be no assurance that the AquaRefined recycled metals will meet the\ncertification and purity requirements of the potential customers. A key component of our business plan is the production of recycled metals through our AquaRefining\nprocess. Our customers will require that our AquaRefined metals meet certain minimum purity standards and, in all likelihood, require independent assays to confirm the\nmetal’s purity. As of the date of this report, we have produced limited quantities of AquaRefined metals. We have not produced AquaRefined metals in significant\ncommercial quantities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or, that such metals will meet the required purity standards of our customers. Further, while\nwe have recently commenced the application of our AquaRefining process towards the recovery of high value metals found in lithium-ion batteries, such as cobalt, nickel,\nlithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, copper, and manganese dioxide, we have only recently begun the development of recycling of lithium-ion batteries, and there can be\nno assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to conduct the recycling and recovery of the high value metals from lithium-ion batteries on a\ncommercial scale.\nWhile we have been successful in producing AquaRefined metals in small volumes, there can be no assurance that either we or our licensees will be able to\nreplicate the process, along with all of the expected economic advantages, on a large commercial scale either for us or our prospective licensees. Our initial commercial\noperations involved the production of lead compounds and plastics from recycled LABs, and the sale of lead bullion and AquaRefined lead. While we believe that our\ndevelopment, testing and limited production to date has validated the concept of our AquaRefining process, the limited nature of our operations to date are not sufficient to\nconfirm the economic returns on our production of recycled metals. Further, we have only recently commenced commercial operations in the area of recycling of lithium-ion\nbatteries. There can be no assurance that either us or our licensees will be able to produce AquaRefined metals from batteries in commercial quantities at a cost of\nproduction that will provide us and our proposed licensees with an adequate profit margin.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business. As of the date of this report, we have 3 issued US patents, 32 international patents,\nand 3 international allowances related to our AquaRefining process.\nWe also have further patent applications pending in the United States and numerous corresponding patent applications pending in 16 additional jurisdictions\nrelating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. However, no assurances can be given\nthat any patent issued, or any patents issued on our current and any future patent applications, will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect our technology. In addition, we\ncannot assure you that any patents issued now or in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.\nEven patents issued to us may not stop a competitor from illegally using our patented processes and materials. In such event, we would incur substantial costs and\nexpenses, including lost time of management in addressing and litigating, if necessary, such matters. Additionally, we rely upon a combination of trade secret laws and\nnondisclosure agreements with third parties and employees having access to confidential information or receiving unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and\ntechnology to protect our proprietary rights and technology. These laws and agreements provide only limited protection. We can give no assurance that these measures will\nadequately protect us from misappropriation of proprietary information.\nOur processes may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions .The applied science industry is\ncharacterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. Though we do not expect to be subject to any of these allegations, any allegation of infringement\ncould be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause suspension of operations or force us to enter into\nroyalty, license, or other agreements rather than dispute the merits of such allegation. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings, we\nmay be forced into protracted and costly litigation. We may not be successful in defending such litigation and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license\nagreements on acceptable terms or at all.\n12\nTable of Contents\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a\nmaterial disruption of our product development programs. Our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future customers, vendors, licensees,\ncollaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and\ntelecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur\nand cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a disruption of our research and development and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade\nsecrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or\napplications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further\ndevelopment and commercialization of our recycling technologies could be delayed.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the\ninformation systems and networks of our company and our customers, vendors, licensees, collaborators and other contractors or consultants, including personal information\nof our employees and others, and company and third-party confidential data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our customers,\nvendors, licensees, collaborators and other contractors or consultants or fraudulently induce our personnel or the personnel of third parties to disclose sensitive information\nin order to gain access to our data and/or systems. We may experience threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, phishing and other\ncyberattack. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of, or accidental or intentional loss of data from, our\ninformation technology systems or those of our customers, vendors, licensees, collaborators and other contractors or consultants occurs, the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money\nand other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and/or claims made by individuals and groups\nin private litigation involving privacy issues related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or\ninappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices.\nAlthough we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the\ndevelopment and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to\novercome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As we\noutsource more of our information systems to vendors, engage in more electronic transactions with third parties, and rely more on cloud-based information systems, the\nrelated security risks will increase and we will need to expend additional resources to protect our technology and information systems. In addition, there can be no assurance\nthat our internal information technology systems or those of our customers, vendors, licensees, collaborators and other contractors or consultants will be sufficient to protect\nus against breakdowns, service disruption, data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, or prevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a\ncyberattack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks or insider threat attacks which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\nRisks Relating to Geopolitical, Macroeconomic and Industry Factors\nUnfavorable geopolitical and macroeconomic developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business could\nbe adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and global economies, the United States and global financial markets and adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic\ndevelopments, including rising inflation rates, the continuing adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukrainian/Russian and Israeli/Palestinian conflicts and related\nsanctions, bank failures, and economic uncertainties related to these conditions. While the COVID-19 pandemic has abated, many of the consequences of the COVID-19\npandemic continue to cause disruption and increased costs for businesses. We believe there continue to be, among other things, supply chain disruptions that are causing\ndelays in the delivery of equipment and inventory and staffing shortages.\nAdditionally, inflation rates, particularly in the United States, have increased to levels not seen in years, and increased inflation may result in increases in our\noperating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity and limits on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all. In response to\nrising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial\nmarkets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks.\nFurther, financial markets around the world experienced volatility following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 and the eruption of the\nIsraeli/Palestinian conflict in October 2023, including as a result of economic sanctions and export controls against Russia and countermeasures taken by Russia. The full\neconomic and social impact of these sanctions and countermeasures, in addition to the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, which could conceivably expand,\nremains uncertain; however, both the conflicts and related sanctions have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to trade, commerce, pricing stability, credit\navailability, and/or supply chain continuity, in both Europe and globally, and has introduced significant uncertainty into global markets. While we do not currently operate in\nRussia, Ukraine or the Middle East, as the adverse effects of these conflicts continue to develop our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAny of the foregoing could harm our business. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our business\nand financial condition. The extent to which the foregoing impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur business may be negatively affected by labor issues and higher labor costs. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain\nnew and existing employees. As of the date of this report, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our labor relations to be\nacceptable. However, we could experience workforce dissatisfaction which could trigger bargaining issues, employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and\nbenefit consequences, especially during critical operation periods. We could also experience a work stoppage or other disputes which could disrupt our operations and could\nharm our operating results. In addition, legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages and higher labor costs. There can be no assurance that we may not\nexperience labor issues that negatively impact our operations or results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect our prospects for growth and operating results. Our prospects for growth and operating results will be\ndirectly affected by the general global economic conditions of the industries in which our suppliers, partners and customer groups operate. We believe that the market price\nof battery metal is relatively volatile and reacts to general global economic conditions. Our business will be highly dependent on the economic and market conditions in each\nof the geographic areas in which we operate. These conditions affect our business by reducing the demand for recyclable batteries and decreasing the price of battery metals\nin times of economic downturn and increasing the price of used batteries in times of increasing demand of recyclable batteries. There can be no assurance that global\neconomic conditions will not negatively impact our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the United States. A part of our strategy involves our pursuit of growth opportunities in certain\ninternational market locations. We intend to pursue licensing or joint venture arrangements with local partners who will be primarily responsible for the day-to-day\noperations. Any expansion outside of the U.S. will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop and operate any such facilities,\nincluding the sales, supply and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of\nany resulting revenues. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United\nStates, such as:\n• increased cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n• diminished ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n• heightened price sensitivities from customers in emerging markets;\n• our ability to establish or contract for local manufacturing, support and service functions;\n• localization of our LABs and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n• compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n• compliance with the Federal Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws;\n• foreign currency fluctuations;\n• laws favoring local competitors;\n• weaker legal protections of contract terms, enforcement on collection of receivables and intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n• market disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers’ councils and labor unions;\n• issues related to differences in cultures and practices; and\n• changing regional economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nRisks Relating to Government Law and Environmental Regulations\nU.S. government regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns may adversely affect our business. Our operations and the operations of our licensees\nin the United States will be subject to the federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of batteries including the Occupational\nSafety and Health Act (\"OSHA\") of 1970 and comparable state statutes. Our facilities and the facilities of our licensees will have to obtain environmental permits or\napprovals to expand, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. We and our licensees may face opposition from\nlocal residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our respective facilities. In addition to permitting requirements, our operations and the operations\nof our licensees are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such\nas the acids involved in battery reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial\nhygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe and our licensees are also subject to inspection from time to time by various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies and,\nas a result of these inspections, we and our licensees may be cited for certain items of non-compliance. Failure to comply with the requirements of federal, state and local\nenvironmental, health and safety laws could subject our business and the businesses of our licensees to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could\nadversely affect our business. In addition, in the event we are unable to operate and expand our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally\nresponsible, we and our licensees may face opposition from local governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\nThe development of new AquaRefining technology by us or our partners or licensees, and the dissemination of our AquaRefining process will depend on our\nability to acquire necessary permits and approvals, of which there can be no assurance. As noted above, our AquaRefining processes will have to obtain environmental\npermits or approvals to operate, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. In addition, we expect that any use of\nAquaRefining operations at our partner's facilities will require additional permitting and approvals. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary permits\nand approvals could prevent us and our partners and licensees from pursuing additional AquaRefining expansion, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial\nresults and growth prospects. Further, the loss of any necessary permit or approval could result in the closure of an AquaRefining facility and the loss of our investment\nassociated with such facility.\nOur business involves the handling of hazardous materials and we may become subject to significant fines and other liabilities in the event we mishandle those\nmaterials. The nature of our operations involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, lithium hydroxide, and lithium carbonate that\ncould result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other\nenvironmental liability. Our operations also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead, lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate or acids, into the environment,\nwhich can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be\nimposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. We are also subject to the\npossibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the\nFederal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes, which impose liability\nfor investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural\nresources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. Any\nsuch liability could result in judgments or settlements that restrict our operations in a manner that materially adversely effects our operations and could result in fines,\npenalties or awards that could materially impair our financial condition and even threaten our continued operation as a going concern.\nWe will be subject to foreign government regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns that may adversely affect our business. As our business\nexpands outside of the United States, our operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting\nand compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the\ntransportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the U.S., or they could be less stringent or not as\nstrictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement\nframeworks are in flux and subject to change. Compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could\nadversely affect our business.\nIn the event we are unable to present and operate our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally responsible, we may face opposition from\nlocal governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\n15\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our shares may be subject to fluctuation and volatility. You could lose all or part of your investment. The market price of our common stock\nis subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since January 1, 2023, the reported high and low sales prices of our\ncommon stock have ranged from $1.69 to $0.47 through March 22, 2024. The market price of our shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market may fluctuate as a result of a\nnumber of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n• actual or anticipated variations in our and our competitors’ results of operations and financial condition;\n• changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our shares are covered by analysts;\n• development of technological innovations or new competitive products by others;\n• regulatory developments and the decisions of regulatory authorities as to the approval or rejection of new or modified products;\n• our sale or proposed sale, or the sale by our significant stockholders, of our shares or other securities in the future;\n• changes in key personnel;\n• success or failure of our research and development projects or those of our competitors;\n• the trading volume of our shares; and\n• general economic and market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our shares and result in substantial losses being\nincurred by our investors. In the past, following periods of market volatility, public company stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were\ninvolved in securities litigation, it could impose a substantial cost upon us and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.\nWe have received a notice of delisting or failure to satisfy a continued listing rule from the Nasdaq. On November 24, 2023, we received a letter (from the\nNasdaq Stock Market, LLC, or Nasdaq, notifying us we had fallen below compliance with respect to the continued listing standard set forth in Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq\nListing Rules because the closing bid price of our common stock over the previous 30 consecutive trading-day period had fallen below $1.00 per share.\nPursuant to the Nasdaq’s letter and Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have 180 days from the date of the letter, or until May 22, 2024, to regain\ncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Rule 5550(a)(2) by achieving a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00 per share over a minimum\nof 10 consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) during the initial 180-day period, we may be eligible for additional time to regain\ncompliance, subject to our compliance with the Nasdaq’s continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for The\nNasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our provision of certain undertakings to the Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurance that we\nwill be afforded additional time to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement following the initial 180-day period. If we are unable to regain compliance\nwith Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) in a timely manner, the Nasdaq will commence suspension and delisting procedures.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our shares and result in substantial losses being\nincurred by our investors. In the past, following periods of market volatility, public company stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were\ninvolved in securities litigation, it could impose a substantial cost upon us and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and\ntrading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or\nour business. If industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us\ndowngrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and\ntrading volume to decline. In addition, independent industry analysts may provide reviews of our AquaRefining technology, as well as competitive technologies, and\nperception of our offerings in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what these industry analysts report, and because\nindustry analysts may influence current and potential customers, our brand could be harmed if they do not provide a positive review of our products and platform\ncapabilities or view us as a market leader.\nWe may be at an increased risk of securities class action litigation. Historically, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company\nfollowing a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because early-stage companies have experienced significant stock price\nvolatility in recent years. If we were to be sued, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIn 2017, a securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed against us. In 2021, we were able to settle both actions through our issuance of\n$500,000 of our common shares and our adoption of limited corporate governance reforms, however we incurred significant legal costs in defending both actions and our\nmanagement was required to devote significant time in managing the defense of the actions.\nWe maintain director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate to protect us from potential claims; however, we are responsible for meeting\ncertain deductibles under the policies and, in any event, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will adequately protect us from claims made. Further, the costs of\ninsurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at\nall, which might make it more difficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors.\n16\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common\nstock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our securities or the availability of our securities for future issuance or sale, will have on the\nmarket price of our common stock. Issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the perception that such issuances or sales might occur, could negatively\nimpact the market price of our common stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to\npursue our business plan and cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities\nin the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our\ncommon stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws\nand applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including\ntransactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best\ninterests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n• limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n• do not provide for cumulative voting rights;\n• establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders' proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to\nour board of directors, and\n• provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially\nowns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition.\nThese provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium\nover prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our\nstockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent\nin writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our\nstockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees governed by\nthe internal affairs doctrine. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any\nof our directors, officers or other employees.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nAt Aqua Metals, Inc., we are committed to protecting our information systems, data, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber-\nattacks. In this section, we provide an overview of our cybersecurity practices and the measures we have implemented to mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have established\ncomprehensive cybersecurity policies and procedures that outline the standards and guidelines for safeguarding our digital assets. These policies cover areas such as access\ncontrols, data encryption, network security, incident response, and employee awareness training. We regularly conduct thorough assessments to identify and evaluate\npotential cybersecurity risks. These assessments help us understand our vulnerabilities and prioritize our efforts to mitigate those risks. We have implemented risk\nmanagement strategies that include proactive monitoring, and vulnerability scanning. Due to evolving cybersecurity threats, it has and will continue to be difficult to prevent,\ndetect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity incidents. While we have not experienced any material cybersecurity threats or incidents as of the date of this Report, our\ncybersecurity program might not be able to prevent or mitigate future successful attacks, threats or incidents.\nTo prevent cyber threats, we have implemented a multi-layered approach to security. This includes firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and\nregular software patching. We also enforce strong password policies and implement two-factor authentication for sensitive systems. In the event of a cybersecurity incident,\nwe have a well-defined incident response plan in place. This plan includes procedures for containment, investigation, and recovery. We also maintain backups of critical\ndata to ensure business continuity in case of a breach or system failure.\nWe believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. We provide regular training and awareness programs to educate our employees about best practices,\npotential threats, and their role in maintaining a secure environment. This includes phishing awareness, social engineering training, and ongoing communication about\nemerging threats.\nGovernance\nCybersecurity holds a critical position within our risk management framework, drawing significant attention from both our Board and management. Oversight of\ncybersecurity risks is vested in our Audit Committee, which regularly receives updates from senior management. These updates, provided as needed, feature insights from\nour leaders in information security. Topics covered include the identification of existing and emerging cybersecurity threats, progress reports on risk mitigation efforts,\ndisclosure of cybersecurity incidents, and updates on key information security initiatives. Furthermore, our Board members engage in informal discussions with management\nregarding cybersecurity news and assess any revisions made to our cybersecurity risk management strategies.\n17\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Properties\nOur executive offices are presently located in 4,183 square feet of class A office space in Reno, Nevada. We lease this facility at a lease rate of approximately\n$11,000 per month. The lease term began in September, 2021 and expires September 30, 2024.\nWe have developed and lease an Innovation Center focused on applying Aqua Metals technology to lithium-ion battery recycling. We lease this facility at a lease\nrate of approximately $11,000 per month. The original lease term expired on December 31, 2021, but was renewed for a three year period which commenced on January 1,\n2022 and expires on December 31, 2024.\nOur executive offices were previously located in 21,697 square feet of office and industrial space in a multi-building commercial project known as “Marina\nVillage” located in Alameda, California. This lease was terminated in February 2022.\nWe owned a 136,750 square foot recycling facility on 11.73 acres of land located in TRIC, a 107,000-acre park located nine miles east of Reno, Nevada on I-80.\nAs noted in Note 4, on April 26, 2023, the Company sold the real property to Comstock Inc. for $15.25 million. As noted in Note 13, after paying the note payable, the\nCompany received the net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million.\nIn February 2023, we purchased a property located in TRIC. The property includes both the land and an existing building. The land totals approximately five acres\nand the building is approximately 21,000 square feet. The Company is currently redeveloping the existing facility and installing our first commercial-scale Li AquaRefining\nsystem, which will process an estimated 3,000 tonnes of materials annually. The Company is also exploring plans to develop the remaining land on the property to expand\ncapacity and operations.\nItem 3.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “AQMS.”\nHolders of Record\nAs of March 22, 2024, there were eleven holders of record of our common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We presently intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the operation and expansion of our\nbusiness.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nWe have adopted the Aqua Metals, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan providing for the grant of non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options to purchase\nshares of our common stock and for the grant of restricted and unrestricted share grants. We have reserved 2,127,306 shares of our common stock under the plan. All of our\nofficers, directors, employees and consultants are eligible to participate under the plan. The purpose of the plan is to provide eligible participants with an opportunity to\nacquire an ownership interest in our company.\nIn 2019, our board of directors adopted the Aqua Metals, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). A total of 18,500,000 shares of common stock was\nauthorized for issuance pursuant to the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan provides for the following types of stock-based awards: incentive stock options; non-statutory stock\noptions; restricted stock; and performance stock. The 2019 Plan, under which equity incentives may be granted to employees and directors under incentive and non-statutory\nagreements, requires that the option price may not be less than the fair value of the stock at the date the option is granted.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nAqua Metals is engaged in the business of applying its commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles to develop the clean and cost-efficient\nrecycling solutions for both lead and lithium-ion (“Li”) batteries. Our recycling process is a patented hydro- and electrometallurgical technology that is a novel, proprietary\nand patented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that replaces polluting furnaces and\nhazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and with\nminimal waste. The modular “Aqualyzers” cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage\neconomy.\nOur process was originally designed for lead recycling. Lead is a globally traded commodity with a worldwide market value in excess of $20 billion. We are also\napplying our commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles with the goal of developing the cleanest and most cost-efficient recycling solution for\nlithium-ion batteries. We believe our process has the potential to produce higher quality products at a lower operating cost without the damaging effects of furnaces and\ngreenhouse emissions. Aqua Metals estimates the total addressable market for lithium-ion battery recycling will be approximately $9 billion by 2025 and grow to exceed\nlead battery recycling by the end of the decade.\nIn February 2021, we announced our entry into the lithium-ion battery (LiB) recycling market through a key provisional patent we filed that applies the same\ninnovative AquaRefining approach. In August 2021, we announced we had established our Innovation Center in TRIC focused on applying our proven technology to LiB\nrecycling research and development and prototyping. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical and electrochemical recycling\nexperience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to electric vehicles; growth in internet\ndata centers; and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage.\nDuring the first half of 2022, we announced our ability to recover copper, lithium hydroxide, nickel and cobalt from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company’s\nInnovation Center. During 2022, we built our fully-integrated pilot system, located within the company’s Innovation Center, which is designed to allow Aqua Metals to be\nthe first company in North America to recycle battery minerals from black mass and sell them in the U.S. and position the Company as the first LiB recycler in North\nAmerica to align with the U.S. government’s goal of retaining strategic battery minerals within the domestic supply chain.\nDuring 2022, we conducted environmental comparisons based on Argonne National Lab’s modeling of lithium battery supply chains – called EverBatt. The initial\nresults indicate that AquaRefining is a cleaner approach to LiB recycling, producing far less CO2 waste streams than the two evaluated primary processes currently on the\nmarket which include smelting and chemically driven hydrometallurgical process. In December of 2022, we completed equipment installation and began to operate our first-\nof-a-kind LiB recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. In January of 2023, Aqua\nMetals recovered its first metals from recycling lithium batteries using the patent-pending Li AquaRefining process and is currently scaling operations at the Company’s\npilot facility.\nIn February 2023, we acquired a five-acre recycling campus at TRIC. When fully developed, the facility is designed, to process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion\nbattery material each year using our proprietary AquaRefining technology. We expect to complete development of phase one, including all equipment installation, by the end\nsecond quarter 2024 and to commence operations at the new campus in the third quarter of 2024. Our initial plans call for upgrading the current building to install a\ncommercial-scale Li AquaRefining system capable of recycling 3,000 tons of lithium battery ‘black mass’ each year. We expect to complete redevelopment of the current\nspace and finalize equipment installation this year, and to commence operations at the new campus in the third quarter of 2024. The purchase of the new property was funded\nwith a non-dilutive loan. We also intend to finance the development of Phase One through a non-dilutive loan. The Company is currently in discussions with a provider of\ndebt financing that has provided financing in the past.\nOur focus for the lead market is providing equipment and licensing of our lead acid battery recycling technologies in an enabler model which allows us to work with\nanyone in the industry globally and address the entire marketplace. Our focus for the lithium market includes operating our first-of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility,\nutilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. We are also exploring partnership and/or joint ventures\nagreements, particularly as our Li AquaRefining matures through 2024. We believe that Aqua Metals is in a position to become one of the few critical minerals recovery\nplayers for which our environmental and economic value proposition should generate both great commercial wins and potentially government grants to accelerate our\ncredibility and progress.\n20\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 3,244,302 shares of common stock pursuant to an At the Market Issuance Sales Agreement (\"ATM\") for net\nproceeds of $3.8 million. We raised a net of $18.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 from the public offering of our common shares and a net of $4.6 million from the sale\nof our common stock to Yulho.\nResults of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, revenue resulted from the sale of inventory consisting of lead compounds that were generated\nduring operation of our former TRIC facility. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, product sales consisted of lead bullion, lead compounds\nand plastics that were generated through the AquaRefining process. The following table summarizes results of operations with respect to the items set forth below for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 together with the percentage change from the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 for those items (in thousands).\nYear ended December 31,\nFavorable %\n2023 2022 (Unfavorable) Change\nProduct sales $ 25 $ 4 $ 21 525%\nPlant operations 6,282 3,959 (2,323) (59)%\nResearch and development cost 1,741 1,813 72 4%\nImpairment expense 4,851 579 (4,272) (738)%\nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment (23) (596) (573) 96%\nGeneral and administrative expense 11,638 9,815 (1,823) (19)%\nTotal operating expense $ 24,489 $ 15,570 $ (8,919) (57)%\nExcept for nominal revenue generated from the sale of lead finished goods, we did not generate revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022. Plant activity during 2023 and 2022 consisted of testing our lithium-ion battery recycling technology, developing the prototype system activities, and quickly\nadvancing from the planning and validation phases to execution and operation of our pilot facility and the build out of our commercial facility.\nPlant operations includes supplies and related costs, salaries and benefits, consulting and outside services costs, depreciation and amortization costs, insurance,\ntravel and overhead costs. Plant operations increase approximately $2,323,000 or 59% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the twelve months\nended December 31, 2022 as a result of an increase in payroll and payroll related fees of approximately $1,702,000, as we hired additional staff to operate the pilot\nfacility, process black mass and build out of our commercial facility in addition to an increase of $482,000 in legal fees and other service costs.\nResearch and development cost includes expenditures related to the improvement of the AquaRefining technology and the development of our lithium-ion battery\nrecycling process. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, research and development costs decreased approximately $72,000 or 4% from the comparable\nperiod in 2022. Research and development is a key part of our business strategy and includes our focus on improving the Company's proprietary technology for LAB\nrecycling and advancing our research related to the application of AquaRefining to recycling lithium-ion batteries. The decrease was driven by moving our focus from R&D\nto operating our fully integrated pilot system at the Innovation Center and build out of our commercial facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $4,851,000, subsequent to an analysis of our investment and construction\nin progress (\"CIP\") with regard to our investment in LINICO and ACME Metals. We recognized a loss on the investment in LINICO of approximately $1,400,000 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 as the result of the sale of our LINICO common stock to LINICO's parent Comstock Inc., for $600,000 payable in twelve equal monthly\ninstallments commercing in January 2024. In addition, we recognized a loss of $3,451,000 million related to the ACME CIP as a result of the suspension of the development\nof recycling operations at the ACME Metals Taiwanese facility. During 2023, management has shifted focus away from the original service under the ACME lead\nrecycling license agreement to a new primary focus on the Lithium recycling business as a Company. As a result, management sees a decrease in the utilization of the\nACME plant and its related operations, and assessed that the future expected cash flows connected with ACME are at or near zero. For the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwe recognized a write down to fair market value of our assets held for sale of approximately $579,000. We recorded a gain of $700,000 that resulted from the write-off of\nplant commitment accrued expenses and $100,000 gain that resulted from the sale of CIP equipment. The gain was offset by a loss on the sale of assets held for sale of\napproximately $100,000 and $100,000 bad debt resulting from the sale of the battery breaker.\nWe recognized a gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment of approximately $23,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to a\ngain of $596,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the gain on property, plant and equipment resulted\nfrom the write-off of plant commitment accrued expenses. Plant clean-up and repair of fire damaged areas were completed by the end of June 30, 2022.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased approximately $1,823,000, or 19%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the twelve months\nended December 31, 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 includes $1,237,000 in payroll and\npayroll-related expenses, as well as an increase of $780,000 in travel-related expenses, advertising and promotion expenses, and overhead expenses, offset by a\n$300,000 decrease in professional fees.\nThe following table summarizes our other income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 together with the\npercentage change in those items (in thousands).\nYear ended December 31,\nFavorable %\n2023 2022 (Unfavorable) Change\nInterest expense $ (621) $ (125) $ (496) 397%\nInterest and other income $ 1,147 $ 262 $ 885 338%\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 526 $ 137 $ 389 284%\nWe recognized interest expense of $621,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $125,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest\nexpense from the prior year is due to the interest paid on the two loans secured in September 2022 and February 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and we recorded approximately $1,147,000 and $262,000 in interest and other income,\nrespectively, an increase of $885,000 or 338%. The $513,000 increase in interest and $242,000 in other revenue is attributable to increased interest on our bank deposits and\nmiscellaneous income from a non-recurring engineering arrangement with 6K Energy, respectively.\n21\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total assets of $33.6 million and working capital of $13.7 million.\nThe following table summarizes our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (3,193) $ (10,148)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (9,813) $ (3,420)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 22,446 $ 12,513\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was approximately $3.2 million and $10.1 million,\nrespectively. Net cash used in operating activities during each of these periods consisted primarily of our net loss adjusted for non-cash items such as\ndepreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation charges as well as net changes in working capital. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we\nrecognized $12.3 million proceeds from sales and leasing of building to LINICO, $1.4 million expense for impairment on LINICO investment and approximately\n$3.5 million expense for impairment on ACME CIP. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a $0.6 million gain on disposal of property and equipment\nand approximately $0.6 million expense for impairment on assets held for sale.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $9.8 million compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring these periods, net cash in investing operations primarily includes fixed asset acquisitions, deposits for future fixed asset purchases and proceeds received from sale of\nequipment, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $3.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of Aqua Metals shares\npursuant to the at-the-market offering, or ATM, $2.9 million in net proceeds from the loan agreement secured with the Summit Investment Services, LLC, $18.3 million in\nnet proceeds from our July 2023 public offering and $4.6 million in net proceeds from the Yulho transaction, offset by the $6 million used to pay off the note payable as\nnoted in Note 13 and by $1.1 million related to tax withholdings to cover RSU vesting . Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022\nconsisted of $6.5 million net proceeds from ATM shares sales and $5.9 million net proceeds from the loan we secured in September 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total cash of $16.5 million and working capital of $13.7 million. As of the date of this report, we believe that we will require\nadditional capital in order to fund our current level of ongoing costs over the next twelve months and move forward with our current business strategy. There can be no\nassurance that we will be able to acquire the necessary funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We intend to seek funds through the sale of equity or debt\nfinancing. Funding that includes the sale of our equity may be dilutive. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our\nbusiness plan and we may be unable to continue operations.\nDue to our lack of revenue from commercial operations, significant losses and need for additional capital,t here is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as\na going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount and\nvaluation of long-lived assets, the valuation of conversion features of convertible debt, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, the determination of estimated asset\nretirement obligations, the determination of stock option expense, and the determination of the fair value of stock warrants issued. Our actual results could differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist stockholders and investors reading the consolidated financial statements in fully\nunderstanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. Upon the\nretirement or sale of our property and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain\nor loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the\nfunctionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life.\nWe periodically evaluate our property, plant and equipment assets for indications that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year\n2023, management has shifted focus away from the original service under the license agreement (Lead business) to a new focus (Lithium business) as a Company. As such,\nmanagement sees a decline in the utilization of the ACME plant and it’s related operations. At December 31, 2023, we recognized write down of approximately $3,451,000\nmillion to equipment under construction that was not yet capitalized related to the ACME CIP as a result of the suspension of the development of recycling operations at the\nACME Metals Taiwanese facility. As of December 31, 2022, management compared the carrying value of the assets held for sale against current fair market values. We\ndetermined the carrying value needed to be reduced to align with current fair market values. At December 31, 2022, we recognized write down on the assets held for sale to\nfair market value and $579,000.\nIntangible and other long-lived assets\nThe intangible assets consist of a patent application contributed to us by five founding stockholders, patent applications for technology developed by us and\ntrademark applications. The useful life of the intangible assets has been determined to be ten years and the assets are being amortized. We periodically evaluate our\nintangible and other long-lived assets for indications that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying\nvalue of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets’ fair value and their carrying value. In\naddition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated lives of our long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result\nin increased depreciation and amortization expense in the period when such determination is made, as well as in subsequent periods. We evaluate the need to record\nimpairment during each reporting period. No impairment has been recorded. We determined that the estimated life of the intellectual property properly reflected the current\nremaining economic life of the asset.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred assets\nand liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities\nand their respective tax bases. The provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We established a\nvaluation allowance to the extent that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.\nWe recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if those positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are\nmeasured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in\njudgment occurs.\nWarrants\nThe Company classifies common stock purchase warrants as equity if the contracts (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give the Company\na choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies any contracts that (i) require net-cash\nsettlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (ii) give the counterparty a\nchoice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (iii) contain reset provisions as either an asset or a liability. The\nCompany assesses classification of its freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is\nrequired.\nThe value of the common stock purchase warrants are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.\nStock-based compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation.” For employee stock-\nbased awards, we calculate the fair value of the award using the closing price of the common stock on date of grant date. For stock-options we calculate the fair value of the\naward on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton method; the expense is recognized over the service period for awards to vest.\nFor stock price hurdle restricted share units the fair value of the award is calculated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model utilizing several key\nassumptions, including share price volatility, the risk-free rate of return, the expected dividend yield and other award design features.\nThe Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee discussion of recent accounting pronouncements in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 in this Annual Report.\nMaterial cash requirements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2,958,000 amount of indebtedness, net of issuance costs, $285,000 interest-only payments are\ndue in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, our total minimum lease payments was $283,000, of which all is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details\nregarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Leases, and Note 13, Note payable, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOperating lease obligations\nWe currently have two operating leases for real estate. We lease our Reno and McCarran, Nevada spaces under non-cancelable operating leases. The Reno, Nevada\nlease expires in 2024. The initial lease term for our mixed office and warehouse space in McCarran, Nevada expired on December 31, 2021. We elected to exercise our first\nextension option provided for in the McCarran, Nevada lease agreement, which extended the current term of the lease to December 31, 2024.\nFinance lease obligation\nWe currently maintain one finance lease for equipment. In November 2021, we entered into a finance lease for a modular laboratory which expires in October of\n2024.\nNote payable\nAqua Metals Reno, Inc. entered into a $3,000,000 loan agreement with Summit Investment Services, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the “Lender”) on\nFebruary 1, 2023.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of\noperations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of\nits operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial\nstatements, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception that raise substantial doubt about its ability to\ncontinue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might\nresult from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based\non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,\nnor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nit relates.\nCritical Audit Matter – Equity-Classified Warrants\nAs described in Note 14, the Company issued (1) a warrant to purchase 363,860 shares of the Company's common stock to the underwriter of the Company's July 2023\npublic offering of common stock and (2) a warrant to purchase 205,761 shares of the Company's common stock to an advisor in connection with the Company’s August\n2023 securities purchase agreement with Yulho Co, Ltd. The Company evaluated whether the warrants were in the scope of ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities\nfrom Equity, which discusses the accounting for instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The application of the requirements in ASC Topic 480, and\nthe resulting classification conclusion, is dependent on whether certain criteria are met. Based on its analysis, the Company concluded that the warrants did not meet any\nof the criteria to be subject to liability classification and are therefore classified as equity.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe identified the classification of the warrants as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the complexity and effort required in\nidentifying all relevant features of and obligations under the instruments for evaluation against the criteria for classification. This required a high degree of auditor effort,\nincluding specialized skills and knowledge, and complex auditor judgment in evaluating the features of and obligations under the warrants and the determination of\nwhether such features meet the criteria for liability-classification.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● We obtained an understanding of management’s process for identifying and evaluating the critical terms of the warrant agreements in determining the\nclassification.\n● With the assistance of professionals in our firm that have specialized skills and knowledge in accounting for debt and equity instruments:\no We evaluated management’s analysis and conclusions regarding the relevant provisions and features of the warrants in light of relevant guidance\nand the criteria for classification.\no We read the securities purchase agreement and underlying warrant agreements to identify the relevant features and settlement provisions for our\nevaluation.\no We independently evaluated the relevant features and settlement provisions of the warrants under relevant guidance considering the criteria for\nclassification.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\nNew York, New York\nMarch 28, 2024\n28\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Aqua Metals, Inc. and Subsidiaries:\nReno, NV\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Aqua Metals, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe \"consolidated financial statements\").\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization and Operations\nAqua Metals is engaged in the business of applying its commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles to develop the clean and cost-efficient recycling\nsolutions for both lead and lithium-ion (“Li”) batteries. Our recycling process is a patented hydro- and electrometallurgical technology that is a novel, proprietary and\npatented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that replaces polluting furnaces and hazardous\nchemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and with minimal\nwaste. The modular “Aqualyzers” cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy.\nWe are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining, which is fundamentally non-polluting, can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals\nfrom lithium-ion batteries with lower waste streams and lower costs than existing alternatives.\nOur focus for the lead market is providing equipment and licensing of our lead acid battery recycling technologies in an enabler model which allows us to work with anyone\nin the industry globally and address the entire marketplace. Our focus for the lithium market includes operating our first-of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility, utilizing\nelectricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces.\nLiquidity and Going Concern Assessment\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $23.9 million and $15.4 million, respectively, and negative cash from operations of\n$3.2 million (inclusive of $12.3 million of non-recurring proceeds from the sale of real estate) and $10.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\ncash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.5 million, a working capital surplus of approximately $13.7 million and an accumulated deficit of $223.2 million. The\nCompany has not generated revenues from commercial operations over the two years ended December 31, 2023, except for nominal sales of lead finished goods, and\nexpects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future.\nManagement believes that the Company does not have sufficient capital resources to sustain operations through at least the nextt welve months from the date of this filing.\nAdditionally, in view of the Company’s expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future it will be required to raise additional capital resources in order to\nfund its operations, although the availability of, and the Company’s access to such resources, is not assured. Accordingly, management believes that there is substantial\ndoubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern through the next twelve months from the date of this filing.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments\nto reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern.\nReclassification of Prior Period Financial Statements\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, impairment expense and gain on disposal of property and equipment were presented in the Consolidated Statement of Operations\nwithin loss from operations.\nWe have reclassified the prior period Consolidated Statement of Operations included in this filing to conform to the current period presentation, as shown in the following\ntable:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2022\nAs Reported Reclassification As Reclassified\nOperating cost and expense\nImpairment expense — 579 579\nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment — (596) (596)\nTotal operating expense $ 15,587 $ (17) $ 15,570\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (15,583) $ 17 $ (15,566)\nOther income and expense\nImpairment expense (579) 579 —\nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment 596 (596) —\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 154 $ (17) $ 137\n35\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the foregoing, we have also identified the following reclassifications which will be made to the 2023 periods to be presented in the interim financial\nstatements in our 2024 10-Q filings:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022\nAs Reported Reclassification As Reclassified As Reported Reclassification As Reclassified\nOperating cost and expense\nGain on disposal of property, plant and\nequipment — - - — (23) (23)\nTotal operating expense $ 4,974 $ - $ 4,974 $ 14,345 $ (23) $ 14,322\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (4,949) $ - $ (4,949) $ (14,320) $ 23 $ (14,297)\nOther income and expense\nGain on disposal of property, plant and\nequipment - - — 23 (23) —\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 402 $ - $ 402 $ 408 $ (23) $ 385\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2023 Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nAs Reported Reclassification As Reclassified As Reported Reclassification As Reclassified\nOperating cost and expense\nGain on disposal of property, plant and\nequipment — (3) (3) — (23) (23)\nTotal operating expense $ 4,855 $ (3) $ 4,852 $ 9,371 $ (23) $ 9,348\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (4,855) $ 3 $ (4,852) $ (9,371) $ 23 $ (9,348)\nOther income and expense\nGain on disposal of property, plant and\nequipment 3 (3) — 23 (23) —\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 96 $ (3) $ 93 $ 6 $ (23) $ (17)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023\nAs Reported Reclassification As Reclassified\nOperating cost and expense\nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment — (20) (20)\nTotal operating expense $ 4,516 $ (20) $ 4,496\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (4,516) $ 20 $ (4,496)\nOther income and expense\nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment 20 (20) —\nTotal other income (expense), net $ (90) $ (20) $ (110)\n36\nTable of Contents\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include those of Aqua Metals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Aqua Metals”), after\nelimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n(the “SEC”).\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported\namount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of\nexpenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount and valuation of long-lived assets, valuation allowances\nfor deferred tax assets, the determination of stock option expense and the determination of the fair value of stock warrants issued. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original or remaining maturities of ninety days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany maintains its cash balances in large financial institutions. Periodically, such balances may be in excess of federally insured limits.\nAccounts receivable\nThe Company has traditionally sold its products to large well-established companies and extends credit without requiring collateral, based on an ongoing evaluation of the\ncustomer’s business prospects and financial condition. In the event that payment of a customer’s account receivable is doubtful, the Company would reserve the receivable\nunder an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no trade accounts receivable balance and has not created a reserve for doubtful\naccounts. The total accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2023 consisted of proceeds from the non-recurring engineering agreement with 6K Energy.\nNote receivable\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has a note receivable from the sale of stock in LINICO totaling $600,000. The proceeds will be received over a 12 month installment\nstarting in January 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we evaluated the need for an allowance for credit loss using the guidelines set forth in ASC3 26 CECL, and have\ndetermined this note is fully collectible and, therefore, we have not recorded an allowance against this balance.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is recorded on af irst-in, first-out basis using the weighted average method. Net realizable value is\ndetermined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The Company\nrecords a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the\nrelated inventory, which is not subsequently written up.\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease.\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. We periodically\nevaluate our property, plant and equipment assets for indications that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. During 2023, management has shifted focus\naway from the original service under the ACME lead recycling license agreement to a new primary focus on the Lithium recycling business as a Company. As a result,\nmanagement sees a decrease in the utilization of the ACME plant and its related operations, and assessed that the future expected cash flows connected with ACME are at or\nnear zero. Therefore, at December 31, 2023, we recognized write down of approximately $3,451,000 million to equipment under construction that was not yet\ncapitalized related to the ACME CIP as a result of the suspension of the development of recycling operations at the ACME Metals Taiwanese facility. As of December 31,\n2022, management compared the carrying value of the assets held for sale against current fair market values. We determined the carrying value needed to be reduced to align\nwith current fair market values. At December 31, 2022, we recognized a write down of $579,000 on the assets held for sale to their fair market value.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual property, net\nIntellectual property consists of patent applications contributed to the Company by five founding stockholders and patent applications for technology developed by the\nCompany. The useful life of this intellectual property has been determined to be ten years and the assets are being amortized straight-line over this period. The Company\nperiodically evaluates its intangible and other long-lived assets for indications that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the\nCompany compares the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.\nWhen the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets’ fair\nvalue and their carrying value. In addition to the recoverability assessment, the Company routinely reviews the remaining estimated lives of its long-lived assets. Any\nreduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the period when such determination is made, as well as in subsequent\nperiods. The Company evaluates the need to record impairment during each reporting period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined that the\nestimated life of the intellectual property properly reflected the current remaining economic life of the asset.\nInvestment in LINICO\nInvestments, which may be made from time to time for strategic reasons (andn ot to engage in the business of investments) are included in non-current assets in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Investments are recorded at cost and the Company analyzes the value of investments on a quarterly basis. The nature and timing of the\nCompany’s investments will depend on available capital at any particular time and the investment opportunities identified and available to the Company. The Company\naccounted for the LINICO investment under ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities, using the measurement alternative of recording at cost as the investment in LINICO\ndoesn’t have a readily determinable fair value. As of December 31, 2023, the Company sold its investment in LINICO and recorded an impairment of $1,400,000 and a\nreceivable of $600,000.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) and short-term and long-term lease liabilities are\nincluded in the consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present\nvalue of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate\nthe lease. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements with terms less than 12 months, the Company has\nelected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption, and the Company recognizes such lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company records revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 provides a single\ncomprehensive model for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-\nspecific guidance. It requires an entity to recognize revenue when the entity transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to\nwhich the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when\nconsidering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3)\ndetermining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is\nsatisfied. ASC 606 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including\nqualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain\nor fulfill a contract.\nRevenue is generally recognized with the delivery of the Company’s products to customers. Sales, value add, and other taxes, if any, that are collected concurrent with\nrevenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue as they are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of\nthe contract are recognized as expense. Freight and shipping costs related to the transfer of the Company’s products to customers are included in revenue and cost of product\nsales. Payment on invoices is generally due within 30 days of the invoice.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nContracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the\ncustomer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. The Company expects that many of our contracts will have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual\ngoods or services will not be separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and therefore, not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations,\nrevenue will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the\ncontract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling prices is based on prices charged separately to customers or expected cost-plus margin. At present, the\nCompany does not have any arrangements with multiple performance obligations.\nSignificant Judgments\nThe Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount to which it expects to be entitled and includes estimated amounts in revenue to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Adjustments to revenue\nis recognized in the period when the uncertainty is resolved. To date, any adjustments to estimates have not been material.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length ofo ne year or less and (ii) contracts for\nwhich we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\n38\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development\nThe Company conducts research and development activities, primarily focusing on refining recycling processes to increase yield and purity of recovered materials. This\nentails experimenting with different techniques, equipment, and operational parameters to enhance efficiency. All research and development expenditures are expensed as\nincurred.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred\nassets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases. The provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The\nCompany establishes a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if those positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions\nare measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in\njudgment occurs.\nFair value measurements\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses\napproximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of short and long-term debt, and lease liabilities also approximates fair value\nsince these instruments bear market rates of interest or are calculated using market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.\nFair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or payment to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2. Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that aren ot active, or other\ninputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3. Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data.\nThe asset or liability’s fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThere are no assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis atD ecember 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation.” The fair value of\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period\nduring which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally three years for RSUs. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nThe fair value of RSU grants with performance conditions is determined using the closing price of our common stock on date of grant. The calculated compensation cost is\nadjusted based on an estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest and our assessment of the probable outcome of the performance condition. The fair value of RSU grants\nwith market conditions is calculated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model utilizing several key assumptions, including expected share price volatility,\nthe risk-free rate of return, the expected dividend yield and other award design features.\n39\nTable of Contents\nNet loss per share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of vested shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is\ncomputed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common securities, options and warrants. Potential dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of the common\nstock underlying in-the-money stock options and is calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock\nmethod, the exercise price of an option and the average amount of compensation cost, if any, for future services that the Company has not yet recognized when the option is\nexercised, are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period.\nFor all periods presented in this report, unvested restricted stock, stock options and warrants weren ot included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because such\ninclusion would have had an antidilutive effect.\nYear Ended December 31,\nExcluded potentially dilutive weighted average securities (1): 2023 2022\nOptions to purchase common stock 390,684 1,013,962\nUnvested restricted stock 7,471,648 7,403,644\nFinancing warrants to purchase common stock 252,035 6,372\nTotal potential dilutive weighted average securities 8,114,367 8,423,978\n(1) Securities are presented on a weighted average outstanding calculation as required if the securities were dilutive.\nSegment and geographic information\nOur chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities\nfor which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM\nviews its operations and manages its business in one operating segment.\nConcentration of credit risk\nThe Company generated revenue of $25,000 and $4,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the sale of lead finished goods to P. Kay\nMetals. Revenue from P. Kay Metals represented 100% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company did not have a trade receivable\nbalance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This\nASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of\nthe individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This\nASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for\nthe year ending December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a\nreporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU\nwill result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which\nreplaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. The measurement\nof expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost. It also applies to Off-Balance Sheet (“OBS”) credit\nexposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments and leases\nrecognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods\nbeginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. As of its\nadoption date of January 1, 2023, the Company did not record a transition adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 326. The adoption of this standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s financials as of December 31, 2023.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's\nOwn Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity, which is intended to simplify the accounting for certain\nfinancial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity's own equity. The guidance allows for either\nfull retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and early adoption is\npermitted. The Company elected early adoption of ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2023 on a modified retrospective basis. There was no material impact to\nthe financial statements as a result of the adoption.\n40\nTable of Contents\n3. Revenue recognition\nThe Company has historically generated revenues by recycling lead acid batteries (“LABs”) and selling the recovered lead to its customers.\nThe Company was not in commercial production in 2023 or 2022. The nominal revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022 resulted from the sale of from the sale of lead finished goods that were generated during operation of the TRIC facility prior to theN ovember 2019 fire at our TRIC\nfacility. Revenue from products transferred to customers at a single point in time with the delivery of the Company’s products to customers accounted for 100% of our\nrevenue during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n4. Lease receivable\nThe Company entered into an Industrial Lease Agreement with LINICO Corporation, a Nevada corporation, or (\"LINICO\"), dated February 15, 2021 pursuant to which the\nCompany leased to LINICO the 136,750 square foot recycling facility at TRIC. The lease commenced April 1, 2021 and expired on March 31, 2023. LINICO agreed to a\npurchase price of $15.25 million, and paid a nonrefundable deposit of $1.25 million in October 2021, and a second nonrefundable deposit of $2 million in October 2022, per\nthe terms of the agreement, both of which were applied towards the purchase price. The lease agreement was a triple-net lease pursuant to which LINICO was responsible for\nall fixed costs, including maintenance, utilities, insurance, and property taxes. The lease agreement provided for LINICO’s monthly lease payments starting at $68,000 per\nmonth and increasing to $100,640 in the last six months of the lease.\nWith respect to the portion of the facility that was damaged in the November 2019 fire, consisting of approximately 30,000 square feet, the Company was obligated to\ncomplete the clean-up of the damaged area, at the Company's expense and repair all damage to the damaged area, at the Company's expense. Repairs and clean up\nwere completed in 2022. With regard to the equipment on-site at TRIC, the Company granted LINICO the right of first offer to purchase any equipment the Company offers\nfor sale. The lease agreement contained customary representations, warranties and indemnities on the part of both parties. At the beginning of 2022, LINICO purchased\napproximately $0.8 million of equipment.\nThe Company accounted for the Industrial Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement as a sales-type lease. As a component of the accounting for the agreement, the Company\nrecognized at the inception the estimated fair market value of the land and plant of $17.0 million as a lease receivable, which was reflected on the Company's condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021. The implied interest rate of 0.5% was utilized for the amortization of the scheduled building lease/purchase payments\noutlined in the agreement. The Company applied the monthly payments received as a reduction to lease receivable and interest income. The interest income recognized from\nthe agreement is included in \"Interest and other income\" on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. On April 26, 2023, Comstock Inc. exercised their option to\nto purchase the facility at which time the purchase price of $15.25 million was applied against the lease receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany recognized a reduction in the lease receivable balance of approximately $15,527,000 and $920,000, respectively, and recorded $24,000 and $76,000 of interest\nincome, respectively, related to this agreement.

Accordingly, management has applied a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets at both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

If not utilized, the Federal research and development credits carryforward will begin to expire on December 31, 2034. The California credits can\nbe carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s policy is to account for interest and penalties as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no interest related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits. No amounts of penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in the provision for income taxes.\nEffective January 1, 2022, the Company is subject to mandatory capitalization of Section 174 research and development expenditures.

These liabilities involve considerable judgement and estimation and are continuously monitored by\nmanagement based on the best information available, including changes in tax regulations, the outcome of relevant court cases, and other information. The Company\nrecognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s total amount of\nunrecognized tax benefit was approximately $0.5 million, none of which will affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. The Company does not expect its unrecognized\nbenefits to change materially over the next twelve months.\nThe Company files income tax returns with the United States federal government and the State of California.

Consulting Agreement. This Warrant (this “Warrant”) is issued pursuant to that certain Advisory Agreement dated April 3, 2023 between the Company and\nNexpedia Holdings Co., Ltd., as amended on August 10, 2023 (the “Advisory Agreement”).\n2 . Registration of Warrants. The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the “Warrant\nRegister”), in the name of the record Holder (which shall include the initial Holder or, as the case may be, any registered assignee to which this Warrant is permissibly\nassigned hereunder) from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise\nhereof or any distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.\n3 . Registration of Transfers. The Company shall register the transfer of all or any portion of this Warrant in the Warrant Register, upon (i) surrender of this\nWarrant, with the Form of Assignment attached as Schedule 2 hereto duly completed and signed, to the Company’s transfer agent or to the Company at its address specified\nherein (ii) delivery, at the request of the Company, of an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the transfer of such portion of this\nWarrant may be made pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and all applicable state\nsecurities or blue sky laws and (iii) delivery by the transferee of a written statement to the Company making the representations and certifications as the Company may\nreasonably request to procure an exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act. Upon any such registration or transfer, a new warrant to purchase Common Stock in\nsubstantially the form of this Warrant (any such new warrant, a “New Warrant”) evidencing the portion of this Warrant so transferred shall be issued to the transferee, and a\nNew Warrant evidencing the remaining portion of this Warrant not so transferred, if any, shall be issued to the transferring Holder. The acceptance of the New Warrant by\nthe transferee thereof shall be deemed the acceptance by such transferee of all of the rights and obligations of a Holder of a Warrant.\n4. Exercise and Duration of Warrants.\n(a) All or any part of this Warrant shall be exercisable by the registered Holder at any time and from time to time on or after the Trigger Date and\nthrough and including 5:00 P.M. prevailing Pacific time on the Expiration Date. At 5:00 P.M., prevailing Pacific time, on the Expiration Date, the portion of this Warrant not\nexercised prior thereto shall be and become void and of no value and this Warrant shall be terminated and no longer outstanding.\n(b) The Holder may exercise this Warrant by delivering to the Company (i) an exercise notice, in the form attached as Schedule 1 hereto (the “Exercise\nNotice”), appropriately completed and duly signed, (ii) payment of the Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised (which\nmay take the form of a “cashless exercise” if so indicated in the Exercise Notice and if a “cashless exercise” may occur at such time pursuant to Section 10 below), and the\ndate such items are delivered to the Company (as determined in accordance with the notice provisions hereof) is an “Exercise Date.” The Holder shall not be required to\ndeliver the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder. Execution and delivery of the Exercise Notice shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original\nWarrant and issuance of a New Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares.\n5. Delivery of Warrant Shares. Upon exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall promptly issue or cause to be issued and cause to be delivered to or upon the\nwritten order of the Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate a certificate for the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, with an appropriate\nrestrictive legends. The Holder, or any Person permissibly so designated by the Holder to receive Warrant Shares, shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of\nsuch Warrant Shares as of the Exercise Date.\n6. Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance and delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge\nto the Holder for any issue or transfer tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental tax or expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses\nshall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the\nregistration of any certificates for Warrant Shares or Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder or an Affiliate thereof.

Replacement of Warrant. If this Warrant is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution\nfor and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and substitution for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of\nsuch loss, theft or destruction (in such case) and, in each case, a customary and reasonable indemnity (which shall not include a surety bond), if requested. Applicants for a\nNew Warrant under such circumstances shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party costs as the\nCompany may prescribe. If a New Warrant is requested as a result of a mutilation of this Warrant, then the Holder shall deliver such mutilated Warrant to the Company as a\ncondition precedent to the Company’s obligation to issue the New Warrant.\n2\n8 . Reservation of Warrant Shares. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its authorized but\nunissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as herein provided, the\nnumber of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and deliverable upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive rights or any other contingent purchase\nrights of persons other than the Holder (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 9). The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares so issuable and\ndeliverable shall, upon issuance and the payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance with the terms hereof, be duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid\nand nonassessable. The Company will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be issued as provided herein without\nviolation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Common Shares may be\nlisted.\n9. Certain Adjustments. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time\nas set forth in this Section 9.\n( a ) Stock Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock or\notherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger\nnumber of shares, or (iii) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by\na fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which shall be the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph shall become effective\nimmediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of\nthis paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination.\n(b) Fundamental Transactions. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company\nwith or into another Person, in which the Company is not the survivor, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a majority of its Common\nStock is acquired by a third party, in each case, in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person)\nis completed pursuant to which all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property,\nor (iv) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into\nor exchanged for other securities, cash or property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock covered by Section 9(a) above) (in any\nsuch case, a “Fundamental Transaction”), then the Holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities,\ncash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental\nTransaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant without regard to any limitations on exercise contained herein\n(the “Alternate Consideration”). The provisions of this paragraph (b) shall similarly apply to subsequent transactions analogous to a Fundamental Transaction.\n3\n(c) Number of Warrant Shares. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 9, the number of\nWarrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise\nPrice payable hereunder for the increased or decreased number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such\nadjustment.\n(d) Calculations. All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as applicable. The number of\nshares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the sale or issuance of any such\nshares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock.\n(e) Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment pursuant to this Section 9, the Company at its expense will, at the written request of\nthe Holder, promptly compute such adjustment, in good faith, in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including\na statement of the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable),\ndescribing the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the Company will\npromptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder and to the Company’s transfer agent.\n(f) Notice of Corporate Events. If, while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company (i) declares a dividend or any other distribution of cash, securities or\nother property in respect of its Common Stock, including, without limitation, any granting of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the\nCompany, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters into any agreement contemplating or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii) authorizes the\nvoluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, except if such notice and the contents thereof shall be deemed to constitute material\nnon-public information, the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice describing the material terms and conditions of such transaction at least ten (10) Trading Days prior\nto the applicable record or effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common Stock in order to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction, and the\nCompany will take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the Holder is given the practical opportunity to exercise this Warrant prior to such time so as to\nparticipate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided, however, that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the\ncorporate action required to be described in such notice.\n1 0 . Payment of Exercise Price. The Holder shall pay the Exercise Price in immediately available funds; provided, however, the Holder may, in its sole\ndiscretion, satisfy its obligation to pay the Exercise Price through a “cashless exercise”, in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares\ndetermined as follows:\n4\nX = Y [(A-B)/A]\nwhere:\nX = the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder.\nY = the total number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is being exercised.\nA = the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets) for the five Trading Days ending\non the date immediately preceding the Exercise Date.\nB = the Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable Warrant Shares at the time of such exercise.\nFor purposes of this Warrant, “Closing Sale Price” means, for any security as of any date, the last trade price for such security on the principal securities exchange or trading\nmarket for such security, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or, if such exchange or trading market begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does not\ndesignate the last trade price, then the last trade price of such security prior to 4:00:00 p.m., New York Time, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or if the\nforegoing do not apply, the last trade price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg\nFinancial Markets, or, if no last trade price is reported for such security by Bloomberg Financial Markets, the Closing Sale Price of such security on such date shall be the\nfair market value as mutually determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion.\nFor purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended, understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a cashless exercise\ntransaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this\nWarrant was originally issued pursuant to the Consulting Agreement (provided that the Commission continues to take the position that such treatment is proper at the time of\nsuch exercise).\n11. No Fractional Shares. No fractional Warrant Shares will be issued in connection with any exercise of this Warrant. In lieu of any fractional shares which\nwould otherwise be issuable, the number of Warrant Shares to be issued shall be rounded up to the next whole number.\n12. Notices.

Miscellaneous.\n(a) The Holder, solely in such Person's capacity as a holder of this Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of\nshare capital of the Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon the Holder, solely in such Person's capacity as the\nHolder of this Warrant, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether any reorganization,\nissue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation, merger, amalgamation, conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights,\nor otherwise, prior to the issuance to the Holder of the Warrant Shares which such Person is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant.

ADDITIONAL THIRD-PARTY FEES. Pay any and all third-party fees incurred by Lender in connection with the credit facilities hereunder.\nSECTION 4.11. LATE CHARGE.

Borrower\nagrees that if, for any reason, any monthly installment of interest shall not be received by Lender within ten (10) days of its due date, Lender shall be entitled to damages for\nthe detriment caused thereby. Borrower therefore agrees to pay Lender a late charge of ten percent (10%) of such installment, but not including the final payment, or the\nmaximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less, such late charge to be immediately due and payable without notice or demand by Lender. Borrower will pay this late\ncharge only once for each late installment payment, but not including the final payment. This Section and the amounts for which it provides shall not limit Lender's right,\nunder this Note, the Deed of Trust, or otherwise, to compel prompt performance thereunder. Lender's failure to collect such late charges shall not constitute a waiver of\nLender's right to require payment of such late charges for past or future Defaults. Any late charge shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available to Lender\nupon the occurrence of a default under the Loan Documents. BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR\nIMPRACTICABLE TO FIX THE ACTUAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AMOUNTS WHEN DUE AND THEREFORE,\nSHALL PAY SUCH LATE CHARGES NOT AS A PENALTY, BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFRAYING THE EXPENSES INCIDENT TO SERVICING THE\nLOAN AND HANDLING AMOUNTS PAST DUE. FURTHER, BORROWER AGREES THAT THE LATE CHARGES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE A REASONABLE\nESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES TO LENDER. THE LATE CHARGES SHALL BE PAYABLE BY BORROWER WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE RIGHTS OF\nLENDER TO COLLECT ANY OTHER AMOUNTS TO BE PAID UNDER THIS NOTE OR THE DEED OF TRUST.\n7\nSECTION 4.12 DEFAULT INTEREST. Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, interest on any amounts then outstanding\nshall be increased automatically from the date of the Event of Default until cured to thirteen percent (13%) per annum (\"Default Interest\"), and all outstanding amounts due,\nincluding unpaid Regular Interest shall continue to accrue interest from the date of such Event of Default at the Default Interest rate until such Event of Default is cured or\nwaived. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the application of Default Interest may result in the compounding of interest.\nARTICLE V\nNEGATIVE COVENANTS\nBorrower further covenants that so long as any liabilities (whether direct or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated) of Borrower to Lender under any of the Loan\nDocuments remain outstanding, and until payment in full of all obligations of Borrower subject hereto, Borrower will not without Lender's prior written consent:\nSECTION 5.1.

This Agreement shall be interpreted on a basis consistent with such intent. If any payments or benefits provided to\nEmployee by the Company, either per this Agreement or otherwise, are non-qualified deferred compensation subject to, and not exempt from, Code Section 409A (“Subject\nPayments”), the following provisions shall apply to such payments and/or benefits:\n3.7.1 For payments and benefits triggered by termination of employment, reference to Employee’s “termination of employment” (and corollary\nterms) with the Company shall be construed to refer to Employee’s “separation from service” from the Company (with such phrase determined under Treas. Reg. Section\n1.409A-1(h), as uniformly applied by the Company) in tandem with the termination of his employment with the Company.\n3.7.2 If Employee is deemed on the date of his “separation from service” to be a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section\n1.409A-1(i)), then with regard to any payment that is required to be delayed pursuant to Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) (the “Delayed Payments”), such payment shall not be\nmade prior to the earlier of (i) the first day of the seventh month following the date of his “separation from service” and (ii) the date of his death. The Delayed Payments\nshall be paid to Employee in a lump sum promptly following the date set forth in the preceding sentence. Any payments other than the Delayed Payments shall be paid in\naccordance with the normal payment dates specified herein. In no case will the delay of any of the Delayed Payments by the Company constitute a breach of the Company’s\nobligations to Employee.\n3.7.3 Employee’s right to receive installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and\ndistinct payments.\n3.7.4 Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within\nthe specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.\n3.7.5 If the 60 day period following Employee’s “separation from service” begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year (a\n“Crossover 60-Day Period”), then any severance payments subject to Code Section 409A that would otherwise occur during the portion of the Crossover 60-Day Period that\nfalls within the first year will be delayed and paid in a lump-sum upon the later of (i) January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Employee’s\n“separation from service” occurs, and (ii) the date when the payment of severance payments would otherwise begin hereunder.\n3.7.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Subject Payment be subject to offset by any other\namount unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.\n4 of 11\n3.7.7 To the extent that any reimbursement or in-kind benefits are Subject Payments: (i) the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefit in\none calendar year may not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefit in any other calendar year (except that a plan providing medical or health benefits\nmay impose a generally applicable limit on the amount that may be reimbursed or paid), (ii) the right to reimbursement or an in-kind benefit is not subject to liquidation or\nexchange for another benefit, and (iii) subject to any shorter time periods provided herein, any such reimbursement of an expense or in-kind benefit must be made on or\nbefore the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.\n3.7.8 If an amendment of this Agreement is necessary in order for it to comply with Code Section 409A, Employee and the Company agree to\nnegotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement in a manner that preserves the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent reasonably possible.\n3.8 Limitation on Payments. In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Employee (i) constitute “parachute\npayments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then\nEmployee’s benefits under this Agreement shall be either (A) delivered, subject to any applicable tax or other withholdings, in full, or (B) delivered, subject to any\napplicable tax or other withholdings, to such lesser extent as would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts,\ntaking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Employee, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of\nbenefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and Employee otherwise agree in\nwriting, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by an independent public accountant chosen by the Company (the “Accountant”), whose\ndetermination shall be conclusive and binding upon Employee and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the\nAccountant may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the\napplication of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Employee shall furnish to the Accountant such information and documents as the Accountant may\nreasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountant may reasonably incur in connection with any\ncalculations contemplated by this Section.\n4.

Unless the Company and Employee otherwise agree in\nwriting, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by an independent public accountant chosen by the Company (the “Accountant”), whose\ndetermination shall be conclusive and binding upon Employee and the Company for all purposes.

This Agreement shall be interpreted on a basis consistent with such intent. If any payments or benefits provided to\nEmployee by the Company, either per this Agreement or otherwise, are non-qualified deferred compensation subject to, and not exempt from, Code Section 409A (“Subject\nPayments”), the following provisions shall apply to such payments and/or benefits:\n3.7.1 For payments and benefits triggered by termination of employment, reference to Employee’s “termination of employment” (and corollary\nterms) with the Company shall be construed to refer to Employee’s “separation from service” from the Company (with such phrase determined under Treas.

In no case will the delay of any of the Delayed Payments by the Company constitute a breach of the Company’s\nobligations to Employee.\n3.7.3 Employee’s right to receive installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and\ndistinct payments.\n3.7.4 Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within\nthe specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.\n3.7.5 If the 60 day period following Employee’s “separation from service” begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year (a\n“Crossover 60-Day Period”), then any severance payments subject to Code Section 409A that would otherwise occur during the portion of the Crossover 60-Day Period that\nfalls within the first year will be delayed and paid in a lump-sum upon the later of (i) January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Employee’s\n“separation from service” occurs, and (ii) the date when the payment of severance payments would otherwise begin hereunder.\n3.7.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Subject Payment be subject to offset by any other\namount unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.\n4 of 11\n3.7.7 To the extent that any reimbursement or in-kind benefits are Subject Payments: (i) the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefit in\none calendar year may not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefit in any other calendar year (except that a plan providing medical or health benefits\nmay impose a generally applicable limit on the amount that may be reimbursed or paid), (ii) the right to reimbursement or an in-kind benefit is not subject to liquidation or\nexchange for another benefit, and (iii) subject to any shorter time periods provided herein, any such reimbursement of an expense or in-kind benefit must be made on or\nbefore the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.\n3.7.8 If an amendment of this Agreement is necessary in order for it to comply with Code Section 409A, Employee and the Company agree to\nnegotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement in a manner that preserves the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent reasonably possible.\n3.8 Limitation on Payments. In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Employee (i) constitute “parachute\npayments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then\nEmployee’s benefits under this Agreement shall be either (A) delivered, subject to any applicable tax or other withholdings, in full, or (B) delivered, subject to any\napplicable tax or other withholdings, to such lesser extent as would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts,\ntaking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Employee, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of\nbenefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and Employee otherwise agree in\nwriting, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by an independent public accountant chosen by the Company (the “Accountant”), whose\ndetermination shall be conclusive and binding upon Employee and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the\nAccountant may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the\napplication of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code.

This Agreement shall be interpreted on a basis consistent with such intent. If any payments or benefits provided to\nEmployee by the Company, either per this Agreement or otherwise, are non-qualified deferred compensation subject to, and not exempt from, Code Section 409A (“Subject\nPayments”), the following provisions shall apply to such payments and/or benefits:\n3.7.1 For payments and benefits triggered by termination of employment, reference to Employee’s “termination of employment” (and corollary\nterms) with the Company shall be construed to refer to Employee’s “separation from service” from the Company (with such phrase determined under Treas. Reg. Section\n1.409A-1(h), as uniformly applied by the Company) in tandem with the termination of his employment with the Company.\n3.7.2 If Employee is deemed on the date of his “separation from service” to be a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section\n1.409A-1(i)), then with regard to any payment that is required to be delayed pursuant to Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) (the “Delayed Payments”), such payment shall not be\nmade prior to the earlier of (i) the first day of the seventh month following the date of his “separation from service” and (ii) the date of his death. The Delayed Payments\nshall be paid to Employee in a lump sum promptly following the date set forth in the preceding sentence. Any payments other than the Delayed Payments shall be paid in\naccordance with the normal payment dates specified herein. In no case will the delay of any of the Delayed Payments by the Company constitute a breach of the Company’s\nobligations to Employee.\n3.7.3 Employee’s right to receive installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and\ndistinct payments.\n3.7.4 Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within\nthe specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.\n3.7.5 If the 60 day period following Employee’s “separation from service” begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year (a\n“Crossover 60-Day Period”), then any severance payments subject to Code Section 409A that would otherwise occur during the portion of the Crossover 60-Day Period that\nfalls within the first year will be delayed and paid in a lump-sum upon the later of (i) January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Employee’s\n“separation from service” occurs, and (ii) the date when the payment of severance payments would otherwise begin hereunder.\n3.7.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Subject Payment be subject to offset by any other\namount unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.\n4 of 11\n3.7.7 To the extent that any reimbursement or in-kind benefits are Subject Payments: (i) the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefit in\none calendar year may not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefit in any other calendar year (except that a plan providing medical or health benefits\nmay impose a generally applicable limit on the amount that may be reimbursed or paid), (ii) the right to reimbursement or an in-kind benefit is not subject to liquidation or\nexchange for another benefit, and (iii) subject to any shorter time periods provided herein, any such reimbursement of an expense or in-kind benefit must be made on or\nbefore the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.\n3.7.8 If an amendment of this Agreement is necessary in order for it to comply with Code Section 409A, Employee and the Company agree to\nnegotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement in a manner that preserves the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent reasonably possible.\n3.8 Limitation on Payments. In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Employee (i) constitute “parachute\npayments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then\nEmployee’s benefits under this Agreement shall be either (A) delivered, subject to any applicable tax or other withholdings, in full, or (B) delivered, subject to any\napplicable tax or other withholdings, to such lesser extent as would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts,\ntaking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Employee, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of\nbenefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and Employee otherwise agree in\nwriting, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by an independent public accountant chosen by the Company (the “Accountant”), whose\ndetermination shall be conclusive and binding upon Employee and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the\nAccountant may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the\napplication of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Employee shall furnish to the Accountant such information and documents as the Accountant may\nreasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountant may reasonably incur in connection with any\ncalculations contemplated by this Section.\n4.

Purpose\nThis Executive Officer Clawback Policy describes the circumstances under which Covered Persons of Aqua Metals, Inc., a Delaware corporation and any of its direct or\nindirect subsidiaries (the “Company”) will be required to repay or return Erroneously-Awarded Compensation to the Company.\nThis Policy and any terms used in this Policy shall be construed in accordance with any SEC regulations promulgated to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules adopted by the Nasdaq.\nEach Covered Person of the Company shall sign an Acknowledgement and Agreement to the Clawback Policy in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A as a condition to his\nor her participation in any of the Company’s incentive-based compensation programs.\nII. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth below:\n(a) “Accounting Restatement” shall mean an accounting restatement (i) due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under\nthe securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial restatements that is material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements (a “Big R” restatement), or (ii) that corrects an error that is not material to previously issued financial statements, but would result in a material\nmisstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement).\n(b) “Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.\n(c) “Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation” shall mean, in connection with an Accounting Restatement, any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered\nPerson (regardless of whether such Covered Person was serving at the time that Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is required to be repaid) (i) on or after the Nasdaq\nEffective Date, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Person, (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or national\nsecurities association and (iv) during the Clawback Period.\n(d) “Clawback Period” shall mean, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Restatement Date and any\ntransition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\n1\n(e) “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board.1\n(f) “Covered Person” shall mean any person who is, or was at any time, during the Clawback Period, an Executive Officer of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,\nCovered Person may include a former Executive Officer that left the Company, retired or transitioned to an employee role (including after serving as an Executive\nOfficer in an interim capacity) during the Clawback Period.\n(g) “Erroneously-Awarded Compensation” shall mean the amount of Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts. This amount must be computed without regard to any\ntaxes paid.\n(h) “Executive Officer”2 shall mean the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the\ncontroller), any vice-president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a\npolicy-making function, or any other person (including an officer of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries) who performs similar policy-making functions for the\nCompany. For the sake of clarity, at a minimum, all persons who would be executive officers pursuant to Rule 401(b) under Regulation S-K shall be deemed\n“Executive Officers”.\n(i) “Financial Reporting Measures” shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s\nfinancial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measures shall\ninclude stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock price or total shareholder return).\n(j) “Incentive-Based Compensation” shall have the meaning set forth in Section III below.\n(k) “Nasdaq” shall mean The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n(l) Nasdaq Effective Date” shall mean October 2, 2023.3\n(m) “Policy” shall mean this Executive Officer Clawback Policy, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time.\n(n) “Received” shall mean Incentive-Based Compensation received, or deemed to be received, in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting\nMeasure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant occurs after the fiscal period.\n(o) “Repayment Agreement” shall have the meaning set forth in Section V below.\n1 NTD: We recommend that this Policy be administered in the same manner as compensation is approved for executive officers. Since the Company’s Charter says that the\nCompensation Committee approves executive officer compensation, we believe the Compensation Committee should administer and enforce this Policy.\n2 NTD: This definition is the same definition used to define those officers to be disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and required to file Section 16 beneficial\nownership reports. The adoption of this Policy may be a good opportunity for the Board to revisit who qualifies sunder this definition.\n3 NTD: This is the effective time per the amended final listing exchange rules, not the Adoption Date of this Policy. Note that the Company will be required to adopt its\nclawback policy no later than December 1, 2023.\n2\n(p) “Restatement Date” shall mean the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board\naction is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date that a court,\nregulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n(q) “SARs” shall mean stock appreciation rights.\n(r) “SEC” shall mean the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIII. Incentive-Based Compensation\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned or vested wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\nFor purposes of this Policy, specific examples of Incentive-Based Compensation include, but are not limited to4:\n● Non-equity incentive plan awards that are earned based, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;\n● Bonuses paid from a “bonus pool,” the size of which is determined, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;\n● Other cash awards based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;\n● Restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, stock options and SARs that are granted or become vested, wholly or in part, on satisfaction of a\nFinancial Reporting Measure performance goal; and\n● Proceeds received upon the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or vested based, wholly or in part, on satisfaction of a Financial\nReporting Measure performance goal.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation excludes5:\n● Any base salaries (except with respect to any salary increases earned, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal);\n● Bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Committee or Board that are not paid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a Financial Reporting\nMeasure performance goal;\n● Bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards and/or completion of a specified employment period;\n● Non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic measures or operational measures; and\n● Equity awards that vest solely based on the passage of time and/or satisfaction of one or more non-Financial Reporting Measures.\n4 These examples are taken from the SEC’s adopting release of Rule 10D-1.\n5 These examples are also taken from the SEC’s adopting release of Rule 10D-1\n3\nIV. Determination and Calculation of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall promptly determine the amount of any Erroneously-Awarded Compensation for each Executive Officer in\nconnection with such Accounting Restatement and shall promptly6 thereafter provide each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of Erroneously-\nAwarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as applicable.\n(a) Cash Awards. With respect to cash awards, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the difference between the amount of the cash award (whether payable as a\nlump sum or over time) that was Received and the amount that should have been received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\n(b) Cash Awards Paid From Bonus Pools. With respect to cash awards paid from bonus pools, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the pro rata portion of any\ndeficiency that results from the aggregate bonus pool that is reduced based on applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\n(c) Equity Awards. With respect to equity awards, if the shares, options or SARs are still held at the time of recovery, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the\nnumber of such securities Received in excess of the number that should have been received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure (or the value in excess of\nthat number). If the options or SARs have been exercised, but the underlying shares have not been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the number of\nshares underlying the excess options or SARs (or the value thereof). If the underlying shares have already been sold, then the Committee shall determine the amount\nwhich most reasonably estimates the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.7\n(d) Compensation Based on Stock Price or Total Shareholder Return. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder\nreturn, where the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting\nRestatement, the amount shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received (in which case, the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination of\nthat reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq in accordance with applicable listing standards).\nV. Recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation\nOnce the Committee has determined the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation recoverable from the applicable Covered Person, the Committee shall take all\nnecessary actions to recover the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Committee shall pursue the recovery of\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation in accordance with the below8:\n(a) Cash Awards. With respect to cash awards, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in a lump sum\nin cash (or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation) reasonably promptly following the\nRestatement Date or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and signs the Repayment\nAgreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.\n6 NTD: The final SEC rule requires the Company to recover the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation “reasonably promptly.” Consider whether to include a more specific\ntime frame.\n7 NTD: Neither the final SEC rule nor the listing standards provide guidance as to how the Company should determine Erroneously-Awarded Compensation if the\nunderlying shares have been sold. Companies can adopt a policy that specifies how the Company intends to calculate the value of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation,\nfor example, “if the underlying shares have been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the higher of the value of the stock upon vesting, exercise or sale.”\nConsequently, the Company can leave the policy open for interpretation at the time of any Accounting Restatement or prescribe the guidelines in this Policy.\n8 NTD: The final SEC rule requires the Company to recover the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation “reasonably promptly.” Consider whether to include a more specific\ntime frame or outside date (e.g., require repayment within 120 days, or entry into repayment plan within 30 days).\n4\n(b) Unvested Equity Awards. With respect to those equity awards that have not yet vested, the Committee shall take all necessary action to cancel, or otherwise cause to\nbe forfeited, the awards in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.\n(c) Vested Equity Awards. With respect to those equity awards that have vested and the underlying shares have not been sold, the Committee shall take all necessary\naction to cause the Covered Person to deliver and surrender the underlying shares in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.\nIn the event that the Covered Person has sold the underlying shares, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation in a lump sum in cash (or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation) reasonably\npromptly following the Restatement Date or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and\nsigns the Repayment Agreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.\n(d) Repayment Agreement. “Repayment Agreement” shall mean an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Committee) with the Covered Person for the\nrepayment of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation as promptly as possible without unreasonable economic hardship to the Covered Person.\n(e) Effect of Non-Repayment. To the extent that a Covered Person fails to repay all Erroneously-Awarded Compensation to the Company when due (as determined in\naccordance with this Policy), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company to, take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover\nsuch Erroneously-Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Person. [The applicable Covered Person shall be required to reimburse the Company for any\nand all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in accordance with the\nimmediately preceding sentence.]9\nThe Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on all applicable facts and\ncircumstances and taking into account the time value of money and the cost to shareholders of delaying recovery. However, in no event may the Company accept an\namount that is less than the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Person’s obligations hereunder.\nVI. Discretionary Recovery\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take action to recover Erroneously-Awarded Compensation if any one of the\nfollowing conditions are met and the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable:\n(i) The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Person would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company\nhas made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Erroneously-Awarded Compensation, documented such attempts and provided such documentation to the\nNasdaq;\n9 NTD: The Company may, but is not required, to include the fees associated with recovery, e.g., legal fees.\n5\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of\nhome country counsel, acceptable to the Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the Nasdaq; or\n(iii)Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet\nthe requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nVII. Reporting and Disclosure Requirements\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the\napplicable filings required to be made with the SEC.\nVIII. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation Received on or after the Nasdaq Effective Date.\nIX. No Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Person against the loss of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation and shall not pay, or reimburse any Covered Persons for\npremiums, for any insurance policy to fund such Covered Person’s potential recovery obligations.10\nX. Administration\nThe Committee has the sole discretion to administer this Policy and ensure compliance with Nasdaq Rules and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of\nthe SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith. Actions of the Committee pursuant to this Policy shall be taken by the vote of a majority of its members.\nThe Committee shall, subject to the provisions of this Policy, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions as it deems necessary, appropriate or\nadvisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.\nXI. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally\nrequired by any federal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company’s securities are then\nlisted. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything in this Section XI to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be\neffective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination)\ncause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the\nCompany’s securities are then listed.\n10 NTD: While the Company is prohibited from insuring/indemnifying Covered Persons, Executive Officers may separately purchase third-party insurance policies to fund\npotential recovery obligations so long as the Company does not directly/indirectly pay/reimburse the cost of the policies.\n6\nXII. Other Recoupment Rights; No Additional Payments\nThe Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement\nor any other agreement entered into on or after the Adoption Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Person to agree to abide by\nthe terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to\nthe terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity plan, equity award agreement or similar arrangement and any other legal remedies available to the\nCompany. However, this Policy shall not provide for recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation that the Company has already recovered pursuant to Section 304 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act or other recovery obligations.\nXIII. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n7\nExhibit A\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT\nTO THE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER CLAWBACK POLICY\nOF\nAQUA METALS, INC.\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of Aqua metals, Inc.’s Executive Officer Clawback\nPolicy (the “Policy”).

Our recycling process is a patented hydro- and electrometallurgical technology that is an innovative, proprietary and patented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that replaces polluting furnaces and hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and with minimal waste. The modular “Aqualyzers” cleanly generate ultra-pure metal  _one_ atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy.\n\nWe are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining, which is fundamentally non-polluting, can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals from lithium-ion batteries with lower waste streams and lower costs than existing alternatives.\n\nOur focus for the lead market is providing equipment and licensing of our lead acid battery recycling technologies in an enabler model which allows us to work with anyone in the industry globally and address the entire marketplace. Our focus for the lithium market includes operating our _first_ -of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces and licensing.\n\nReverse Stock Split\n\nEffective _November 5, 2024,_ the Company effected a _one_ -for-20 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common shares. Accordingly, all common share, stock option, per common share and warrant amounts for all periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this reverse stock split.\n\nLiquidity and Going Concern Assessment\n\nFor the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ _,_ the Company reported a net loss of $17.1 million and $13.9 million, respectively, and negative cash from operations of $11.6 million and a cash inflow $2.2 million, respectively, including non-recurring proceeds of $12.3 million from the leasing and sale of the building during the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2023._ As of  _September 30, 2024_ _,_ the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.0 million, current liabilities of $7.1 million and an accumulated deficit of $240.3 million. The Company's current liabilities of $7.1 million include the note payable with Summit Investment Services, LLCin the amount of approximately $3 million due on _February 1, 2025_ as disclosed in Note _10._ The Company has _not_ generated revenues from commercial operations and expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future.\n\nManagement believes that the Company does _not_ have sufficient capital resources to sustain operations through at least the next _twelve_ months from the date of this filing. Additionally, in view of the Company’s expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future it will be required to raise additional capital resources in order to fund its operations, although the availability of, and the Company’s access to such resources, is _not_ assured. Accordingly, management believes that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern through the next _twelve_ months from the date of this filing.\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do _not_ include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that  _may_ result from uncertainty related to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nReclassification of Prior Period Financial Statements\n\nFor the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2023_ , the gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment was presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations within loss from operations. This reclassification was made for the year ended _December 31, 2023_ and presented in the Annual Report on Form _10_ -K for the year then ended.\n\nWe have reclassified the prior period Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations included in this filing to conform to the current period presentation, as shown in the following table (in thousands):\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**As Reported** |  **Reclassification** |  **As Reclassified**  \nOperating cost and expense  \nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment | _—_| (23| )| (23| )  \nTotal operating expense | $| 14,345| $| (23| )| $| 14,322  \nIncome (loss) from operations | $| (14,320| )| $| 23| $| (14,297| )  \nOther income and expense  \nGain on disposal of property, plant and equipment | 23| (23| )| _—_  \nTotal other income (expense), net | $| 408| $| (23| )| $| 385  \n  \n_5_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAQUA METALS, INC. \n\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Unaudited) \n\n_2._ Summary of significant accounting policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are described in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended _December 31, 2023_ , and the notes thereto, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form _10_ -K for the year ended  _December 31, 2023_ , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on _March 28, 2024._ There have been _no_ material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_.\n\nBasis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Aqua Metals, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Aqua Metals”) have been prepared in accordance with the interim reporting requirements of Form _10_ -Q, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the period ended _December 31, 2023_ , which are included on Form _10_ -K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on _March_ _28,_ _2024._ Accordingly, they do _not_ include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present fairly each of the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of _September 30, 2024_ , the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _September 30, 2023_ , the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _September 30, 2023_ and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _September 30, 2023_ , as applicable, have been made. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of _December 31, 2023_ has been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of such date, but it does _not_ include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual presentation.\n\nThe results of operations for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ are _not_ necessarily indicative of results that _may_ be expected for the year ending  _December 31, 2024_.\n\nPrinciples of consolidation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries. Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nUse of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount and valuation of long-lived assets, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, and the determination of stock-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n_6_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAQUA METALS, INC. \n\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Unaudited) \n\nNet loss per share\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and warrants to purchase common stock are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.

This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after  _December 15, 2023,_ and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after  _December 15, 2024._ Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn  _December 2023,_ the FASB issued ASU  _No._  _2023_ -_09,_ Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic  _740_).

Accordingly, all common share, stock option, per common share and warrant amounts for all periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this reverse stock split.\n\n**General**\n\nAqua Metals is engaged in the business of applying its commercialized clean, water-based, recycling technology principles to develop cost-efficient recycling solutions for both lead and lithium-ion (“Li”) batteries. Our recycling process is a patented hydro and electrometallurgical technology that is an innovative, proprietary and patented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that has the potential to replace polluting furnaces and hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and with minimal waste. The modular “Aqualyzers” cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy.\n\nThis breakthrough technology was initially applied in the lead acid battery (LAB) recycling industry, building the first integrated recycling system for breaking LAB and recovering pure metal. In 2019, we operated our demonstration AquaRefinery at commercial quantity production levels and produced over 35,000 ‘AquaRefined’ ingots operating twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for sustained periods of time.\n\nWe are also applying our commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles with the goal of developing the cleanest and most cost-efficient recycling solution for lithium-ion batteries. We believe our process has the potential to produce higher quality products at a lower operating cost without the damaging effects of furnaces and greenhouse emissions. \n\nIn February 2021, we announced our entry into the lithium-ion battery (LiB) recycling market through a key provisional patent we filed that applies the same innovative AquaRefining approach. In August 2021, we announced we had established our Innovation Center in TRIC focused on applying our proven technology to LiB recycling research and development and prototyping. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical and electrochemical recycling experience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to electric vehicles; growth in internet data centers; and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, we announced our ability to recover copper, lithium hydroxide, nickel, and cobalt from lithium-ion battery ‘black mass’ at bench scale at the Company’s Innovation Center. During 2022, we built our fully-integrated pilot system, located within the Company’s Innovation Center, which is designed to allow Aqua Metals to be the first company in North America to recycle battery minerals from black mass, sell them in the U.S. and position the Company as the first LiB recycler in North America to align with the U.S. government’s goal of retaining strategic battery minerals within the domestic supply chain.\n\nDuring 2022, we conducted environmental comparisons based on Argonne National Lab’s modeling of lithium battery supply chains – called EverBatt. The initial results indicate that AquaRefining is a cleaner approach to LiB recycling, producing far less CO2 waste streams than smelting or chemical-driven hydrometallurgical processes currently on the market. In December 2022, we completed equipment installation and began to operate our first-of-a-kind LiB recycling facility, utilizing electricity as the catalyst to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. In January 2023, Aqua Metals recovered its first metals from recycling lithium batteries using the patent-pending Li AquaRefining process.\n\n14 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIn February 2023, we acquired a five-acre recycling campus at the TRIC. When fully developed, the facility we design will process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material each year using our proprietary Li AquaRefining technology. Subject to our receipt of the required additional capital, we expect to complete development of phase one. The Company is planning for a phased development of the campus, beginning with the already commenced redevelopment of an existing building on-site into the first commercial-scale Li AquaRefinery, targeting 3,000 tons per annum (tpa) capacity in phase one. In the first half of 2024, we made significant progress on the construction of the planned first phase of the commercial Li AquaRefinery and we continue to pursue the required funding for the completion of the phase one development of our five‑acre recycling campus through various sources, including debt, project finance, joint venture and strategic investment options. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 306,049 shares of common stock pursuant to an at the market issuance sales agreement (\"ATM\") for net proceeds of $2.8 million. On May 14, 2024, we completed a public offering of 1,006,250 shares of our common stock, at the public offering price of $7.80 per share. In connection with the sale of common stock, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of common stock at the rate of one warrant for every share of purchased common stock, at the price of $0.20 per share. After the deduction of the underwriter’s discount and expenses payable by us, we received net proceeds of $7.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 162,215 shares of common stock pursuant to an at the market issuance sales agreement for net proceeds of $3.8 million. We raised a net of $18.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 from the public offering of our common shares and a net of $4.6 million from the sale of our common stock to Yulho.\n\nOur current focus is building and operating our first-of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. We are also pursuing potential partnership and/or joint ventures agreements and licensing agreements, particularly as our Li AquaRefining continues to develop and improve. We believe that Aqua Metals is in a position to become one of the few critical minerals recovery players for which our environmental and economic value proposition should generate both great commercial wins and potentially government grants to accelerate our credibility and progress.\n\n**Plan of Operations**\n\nOur business strategy is based on the pursuit of building, operating and licensing Li AquaRefining recycling capacity to meet the growing demand for critical metals in lithium-ion batteries driven by innovations in automobile batteries, growth in internet data centers, and alternative energy applications, including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage.\n\nWe are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining, which is fundamentally non-polluting, can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals from lithium-ion batteries with lower waste streams and lower costs than existing alternatives. We have already demonstrated at our pilot facility our ability to recover key valuable minerals in lithium-ion batteries, such as lithium hydroxide, copper, nickel, cobalt, and other compounds. Our goal is to recycle commercial quantities of nickel, cobalt, and copper in a pure metal form that can be sold to the general metals and superalloy markets and can be made into battery precursor compound materials with known processes already used in the mining industry. We also intend to recycle commercial amounts of lithium that can be sold to lithium-ion battery manufacturers. We have installed, commissioned, and operated our pilot plant since December of 2022. During the first half of 2024 we have been building a commercial demonstration plant operation with capacity of processing approximately 3,000 tonnes of black mass per year. The location for the pilot demonstration is currently the Innovation Center with the commercial demonstration plant to be constructed at our 5-acre recycling campus starting with processing ~3,000 tonnes of black mass per year and growing to commercial quantities of ~10,000 tonnes per year or more of production. Equipment installation and construction at the demonstration plant is currently paused. These activities will resume once the company obtains funding. The remaining construction and installation are expected to take approximately 6 months from the date of funding.\n\n15 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe did not engage in commercial operations in 2024 and 2023. Our operations have been devoted to developing our Li AquaRefining battery recycling technology. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Aqua Metals was focused on the continued operation of the pilot facility and the build out of our commercial facility. We did not earn any revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table summarizes our results of operations with respect to the items set forth below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 together with the dollar and percentage changes in those items (in thousands).\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Favorable** |  **%** |  **Favorable** |  **%**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **(Unfavorable)** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **(Unfavorable)** |  **Change**  \nProduct sales | $ | — | $ | 25 | $ | (25 | ) | (100.0 | )% | $ | — | $ | 25 | $ | (25 | ) | (100.0 | )%  \nPlant operations | 1,617 | 1,770 | 153 | (8.6 | )% | 6,198 | 4,316 | (1,882 | ) | 43.6 | %  \nResearch and development cost | 398 | 389 | (9 | ) | 2.3 | % | 1,349 | 1,359 | 10 | (0.7 | )%  \nLoss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment | 448 | — | (448 | ) | 100.0 | % | 448 | (23 | ) | (471 | ) | (2047.8 | )%  \nGeneral and administrative expense | 2,748 | 2,815 | 67 | (2.4 | )% | 9,170 | 8,670 | (500 | ) | 5.8 | %  \nTotal operating expense | $ | 5,211 | $ | 4,974 | $ | (237 | ) | 4.8 | % | $ | 17,165 | $ | 14,322 | $ | (2,843 | ) | 19.9 | %  \n  \nPlant operations include materials, supplies related costs, salaries and benefits, consulting, outside services costs, inventory adjustments, depreciation, amortization, insurance, travel and overhead costs. Plant operations decreased approximately $153,000 or 8.6% and increased $1,882,000, or 43.6%, for the for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in plant operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and payroll related fees of approximately $189,000, as we completed a reduction of force during August 2024. Management does not expect the reduction in force to materially impact its current pilot operations or continuing research and development. However, during the fourth quarter 2024 and until funding is received, we expect reduced employee and overhead expense. The severance and other non-recurring expenses related to the reduction in force were not material. The increase in plant operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related fees of approximately $1,283,000, as we hired additional staff and we engaged our lab and engineering staff in operating the pilot facility and processing black mass, as well as $261,000 in supplies and materials, $167,000 increase in insurance expenses and $129,000 in professional fees. These increases occurred prior to the workforce reduction in August 2024.\n\nResearch and development cost includes expenditures related to the improvement of the AquaRefining technology and the development of our lithium-ion battery recycling process. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development costs increased $9,000, or approximately 2.3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and developments costs decreased $10,000, or approximately 0.7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nWe recognized a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of $448,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of $23,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on property, plant and equipment resulted from the sale of fixed assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on property, plant and equipment resulted from the sales of fixed assets.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $67,000, or approximately 2.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase $500,000, or approximately 5.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the write off of the debt issuance costs of $563,000, previously representing a deferred asset.\n\nThe following table summarizes our other income and interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 together with the dollar and percentage changes in those items (in thousands).\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Favorable** |  **%** |  **Favorable** |  **%**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **(Unfavorable)** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **(Unfavorable)** |  **Change**  \nInterest expense | $ | (83 | ) | $ | (87 | ) | $ | 4 | (4.6 | )% | (273 | ) | (518 | ) | 245 | (47.3 | )%  \nInterest and other income | 84 | 489 | (405 | ) | (82.8 | )% | 329 | 903 | (574 | ) | (63.6 | )%  \nTotal other income, net | $ | 1 | $ | 402 | $ | (401 | ) | (99.8 | )% | $ | 56 | $ | 385 | $ | (329 | ) | (85.5 | )%  \n  \nThe decrease in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the reduction on the note payable outstanding balance. \n\nWe recognized approximately $84,000 and $329,000 in interest and other income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, a decrease of $405,000 and $574,000 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to the decrease in miscellaneous income from the non-recurring engineering agreement with 6K Energy.\n\n16 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of $28.5 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.0 million, current liabilities of $7.1 million and a working capital deficit of $2.9 million. The Company's current liabilities of $7.1 million include the note payable with Summit Investment Services, LLCin the amount of approximately $3 million due on February 1, 2025 as disclosed in Note 10. The Company has not generated revenues from commercial operations and expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. In order to satisfy our capital requirements, the Company will need to improve its liquidity position through equity or debt financings and/or reductions in operating costs, in order to satisfy its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. Management is devoting significant efforts to increasing liquidity, raising capital and developing its business. \n\nManagement believes that the Company does not have sufficient capital resources to sustain operations through at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. Additionally, in view of the Company’s expectation to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and its current working capital deficit, it will be required to raise additional capital resources in order to fund its operations, although the availability of, and the Company’s access to such resources, is not assured. Accordingly, management believes that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern through the next twelve months from the date of this filing.\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities | $ | (11,637 | ) | $ | 2,222  \nNet cash used in investing activities | $ | (11,062 | ) | $ | (6,294 | )  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | $ | 9,127 | $ | 22,588  \n  \n**_Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $11,637,000.

There have been no material changes to those risk factors, except as described below:\n\n**_We will_** ** _need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all_** _._ As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.0 million, current liabilities of $7.1 million and a working capital deficit of $2.9 million. As of the date of this report, we believe that we will require additional capital in order to fund our current level of ongoing costs and our proposed business plan over the next 12 months as we move forward with our business strategy. We intend to acquire the necessary capital though debt financing or through the sale of equity. Funding that includes the sale of our equity may be dilutive. If such funding is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment. In addition, our current liabilities of $7.1 million include the note payable with Summit Investment Services, LLC in the amount of approximately $3 million due on February 1, 2025 as disclosed in Note 10. The Summit Investment note is secured by a first priority lien on our facility and site improvements located at our TRIC recycling facility. In the event of our inability to repay or refinance the Summit Investment note, the lender could commence foreclosure action against our recycling facility.\n\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023 states that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\n\n19 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**[](# \"ex\")Item 6.
