Our competitively advantaged portfolio of businesses, coupled with the capabilities of the Value Creation Committee, supported by the full Board, will accelerate our goal of delivering profitable growth and long-term shareholder value creation.\" \n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $170 million, down 1% year over year. Organic revenue declined 2% year over year, which excludes the impact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point. The year-over-year revenue decline was attributable to lower B Medical Systems (\"B Medical\") revenue. The combined Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics business segments grew 5% on an organic basis.\n  * Sample Management Solutions revenue was $85 million, up 4% year over year. \n    * Organic revenue was up 3%, mainly driven by continued strength in Sample Repository Services and Core Products, particularly in Cryogenic Stores and Consumables and Instruments. This was partially offset by a year-over-year revenue decline in Stores.\n  * Multiomics revenue was $66 million, up 8% year over year. \n    * Organic revenue also grew 8% year over year, primarily driven by growth in Next Generation Sequencing, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in Sanger sequencing revenue.\n  * B Medical Systems revenue was $19 million, down 35% year over year. \n    * Organic revenue also declined 35% year over year, mainly due to lower order volume in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to timing of orders.\n\n\n\n_**Summary of GAAP Earnings Results**_\n\n  * Operating loss was $12 million. Operating margin increased 240 basis points year over year. \n    * Gross margin was 40.8%, up 130 basis points year over year, driven by favorable product mix, operational efficiencies, and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased amortization and transformation costs.\n    * Operating expenses were $82 million, down 300 basis points year over year, primarily driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses and lower amortization, partially offset by increased restructuring and transformation costs.\n  * Other income included $6 million of net interest income versus $11 million in the prior year period.\n  * Diluted EPS from continuing operations was ($0.10) compared to $0.05 one year ago.\n\n\n\n_**Summary of Non-GAAP Earnings Results**_\n\n  * Adjusted operating income was $7 million. Operating margin was 4.1%, an improvement of 460 basis points year over year. \n    * Adjusted gross margin was 45.0%, up 220 basis points year over year, primarily driven by favorable product mix, operating efficiencies, and cost reduction initiatives.\n    * Adjusted operating expense in the quarter was $69 million, down 700 basis points year over year, primarily driven by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and lower commissions on cold chain sales in B Medical.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.2 %, up 560 basis points year over year.\n  * Non-GAAP Diluted EPS was $0.18, compared to $0.13 one year ago.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\n  * Revenue for fiscal 2024 was $656 million, down 1% year over year. Organic revenue declined 2%, which excludes the impact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point and a nominal contribution from acquisitions. The year-over-year revenue decline was attributable to lower B Medical revenue. The combined Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics business segments grew 4% on an organic basis.\n  * Sample Management Solutions revenue was $319 million, up 5 % year over year. \n    * Organic revenue was up 4%. The year-over-year revenue increase was driven by growth in both, the Sample Repository Services and Core Products businesses.\n  * Multiomics revenue was $255 million, up 3% year over year. \n    * Organic revenue also grew 3% year over year, driven by growth in Next Generation Sequencing and Gene Synthesis services, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in Sanger sequencing revenue.\n  * B Medical Systems revenue was $83 million, down 27% year over year. \n    * Organic revenue was also down 27% year over year, primarily driven by the timing of cold chain equipment orders.\n\n\n\n_**Summary of GAAP Results**_\n\n  * Operating loss was $201 million. Operating margin decreased 19.6% year over year. \n    * Gross margin was 40.1%, up 60 basis points year over year, primarily driven by favorable product mix, operating efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives, as well as purchase accounting impacts on inventory in the prior year which did not reoccur, partially offset by increased amortization and transformation costs.\n    * Operating expense was $464 million, up 38% year over year due to a $116 million non-cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, increased transformation and restructuring charges, and a benefit of $18.5 million of fair value contingent consideration adjustments related to B Medical recognized in the prior fiscal year that did not reoccur; these increases were partially offset by lower M&A costs and the benefit of our cost reduction initiatives.\n  * Other income included $33 million of net interest income versus $44 million in the prior year period.\n  * Diluted EPS from continuing operations was ($3.09) compared to ($0.19) in fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\n_**Summary of Non-GAAP Results**_\n\n  * Adjusted operating loss was $3 million and operating margin was (0.4%), an improvement of 190 basis points year over year. \n    * Adjusted gross margin was 44.5%, up 70 basis points year over year, primarily driven by favorable product mix, operating efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by margin pressure from lower revenue in the B Medical segment.\n    * Adjusted operating expense was $295 million, down 400 basis points year over year, primarily driven by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and lower commissions on cold chain sales in B Medical.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $49 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.5%, an improvement of about 300 basis points year over year.\n  * Non-GAAP Diluted EPS for fiscal 2024 was $0.41, compared to $0.31 in fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\n**Cash and Liquidity as of September 30, 2024**\n\n  * The Company ended fiscal year 2024 with a total balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $522 million.\n  * Capital expenditures were $13 million in the quarter and $38 million for the full year.\n\n\n\n**Share Repurchase Program Update**\n\n  * In the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares for approximately $249 million under a 10b5-1 trading program.\n  * The Company completed the repurchases of its common stock under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization in September 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased and retired 30.0 million shares of common stock for the full $1.5 billion approved.\n\n\n\n**Review of Statements of Cash Flows** As part of the year end closing process, the Company is currently reviewing the classification of amounts, primarily between the line items \"effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\" and \"cash provided by operating activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows that could potentially impact those line items in our previously issued statements of cash flows for fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and fiscal 2024 quarterly periods. As a result, the Company has not included statements of cash flows in this release. The Company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations are not impacted by any reclassification of these cash flow items for any period. The Company expects to reflect any changes to the previously issued statements of cash flows in its Annual Report of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Guidance for Continuing Operations for Full Year Fiscal 2025 Excluding B Medical Systems**\n\n  * Total organic revenue is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 5% relative to fiscal 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion is expected to be approximately 300 basis points relative to fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nAzenta does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis for the measures on which it provides forward-looking non-GAAP guidance as the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because of the inherent difficulty in accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliations that have not yet occurred, are dependent on various factors, are out of the company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Such adjustments include, but are not limited to, transformation costs, restructuring charges, costs related to acquisitions and divestitures costs, governance-related matters, goodwill and intangible impairments, and other gains and charges that are not representative of the normal operations of the business.\n\n**Pursuing Sale of B Medical Systems Segment** Azenta has announced it is pursuing a sale of its B Medical Systems segment, a manufacturer and global distributor of medical refrigeration devices based in Luxembourg. This action will simplify Azenta's portfolio and allow management to focus on driving revenue growth and profitability in its core businesses. The decision follows work by the Board of Directors to evaluate strategic, operational and financial opportunities to maximize value.\n\nAzenta does not intend to comment further on the process unless and until the Company has determined a specific course of action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.\n\n**Names Lawrence Lin Chief Financial Officer** The Company has also named Lawrence Y. Lin as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Herman Cueto, effective after the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Cueto will remain as an advisor for a period of time to help facilitate a seamless transition.\n\nMr. Lin joins Azenta from GeoStabilization International LLC (\"GSI\"), a privately held industrial company, and brings over twenty years of finance experience, including previously holding senior finance roles at PHC Holdings and Danaher. \n\nMr. Marotta commented, \"We're excited to have Lawrence join the Azenta team. Lawrence is an accomplished finance executive with a proven track record and a skillset that aligns perfectly with Azenta's needs for its next phase of transformation.\" \n\nMr. Marotta continued, \"We will benefit from the many significant contributions Herman made during his time at Azenta, including notably, the development of Ascend 2026, which is already driving considerable margin expansion. He played a key role in laying a terrific foundation on which to build. We wish him the best going forward.\" \n\nBefore joining GSI, Mr. Lin was Senior Vice President of Finance Operations at PHC Holdings Corporation, a leading diversified diagnostic, life sciences and medical device company based in Japan. Prior roles include Vice President of Finance for North America (CFO) and Global Functions at LivaNova, a global medical technology company, and Vice President of Finance Operations at KaVo Kerr, previously part of Danaher, which was spun off as an independent public company named Envista in 2019. Mr. Lin holds a bachelor's degree in finance from California State University, Fullerton.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** Azenta management will webcast its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. During the call, Company management will respond to questions concerning, but not limited to, the Company's financial performance, business conditions and industry outlook. Management's responses could contain information that has not been previously disclosed.\n\nThe call will be broadcast live over the Internet and, together with presentation materials referenced on the call, will be hosted at the Investor Relations section of Azenta's website at <https://investors.azenta.com/events> and will be archived online on this website for convenient on-demand replay. \n\n**Regulation G** â**Use of Non-GAAP financial Measures** The Company supplements its GAAP financial measures with certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors a better perspective on the results of business operations, which the Company believes is more comparable to the similar analyses provided by its peers. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures should always be considered in conjunction with appropriate GAAP measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most nearly comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release following the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. Certain amounts in the tables that supplement the consolidated financial statements may not sum due to rounding. All percentages are calculated using unrounded amounts.\n\n**\"Safe Harbor Statement** \"**under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934** Some statements in this release are forward-looking statements made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Management adjusts the GAAP results for the impact of amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, purchase price accounting adjustments and charges related to M&A, non-recurring costs related to the Company's business transformation initiatives and share repurchases to provide investors better perspective on the results of operations which the Company believes is more comparable to the similar analysis provided by its peers. Management also excludes special charges and gains, such as impairment losses, gains and losses from the sale of assets, certain tax benefits and charges, as well as other gains and charges that are not representative of the normal operations of the business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single measure.\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**per diluted** |  **per diluted** |  **per diluted**  \n_Dollars in thousands, except per share data_ |  **$** |  **share** |  **$** |  **share** |  **$** |  **share**  \nNet income (loss) from continuing operations |  $ |  (4,984) |  $ |  (0.10) |  $ |  (6,582) |  $ |  (0.12) |  $ |  2,806 |  $ |  0.05  \n_Adjustments:_  \nAmortization of completed technology |  6,454 |  0.13 |  6,316 |  0.12 |  4,769 |  0.08  \nPurchase accounting impact on inventory |  â |  â |  â |  â |  927 |  0.02  \nAmortization of intangible assets other than completed technology |  6,364 |  0.13 |  6,621 |  0.13 |  7,481 |  0.13  \nRebranding and transformation costs(1) |  5,114 |  0.11 |  4,255 |  0.08 |  (15) |  â  \nRestructuring charges |  1,279 |  0.03 |  2,064 |  0.04 |  804 |  0.01  \nMerger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase(2) |  52 |  â |  74 |  â |  1,767 |  0.03  \nTax adjustments(3) |  (561) |  (0.01) |  (9) |  â |  (6,691) |  (0.11)  \nTax effect of adjustments |  (4,870) |  (0.10) |  (4,000) |  (0.09) |  (4,379) |  (0.07)  \n**Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations** |  $ |  **8,848** |  $ |  **0.18** |  $ |  **8,739** |  $ |  **0.16** |  $ |  **7,469** |  $ |  **0.13**  \n_Stock-based compensation, pre-tax_ |  1,845 |  0.04 |  3,818 |  0.07 |  (715) |  (0.01)  \n_Tax rate_ |  _14_ |  _%_ |  â |  _15_ |  _%_ |  â |  _15_ |  _%_ |  â  \nStock-based compensation, net of tax |  1,587 |  0.03 |  3,245 |  0.07 |  (608) |  (0.01)  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income excluding stock-based compensation - continuing operations |  $ |  10,435 |  $ |  0.22 |  $ |  11,984 |  $ |  0.23 |  $ |  6,861 |  $ |  0.11  \nShares used in computing non-GAAP diluted net income per share |  48,079 |  52,963 |  59,692  \n  \n**Year Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**per diluted** |  **per diluted**  \n_Dollars in thousands, except per share data_ |  **$** |  **share** |  **$** |  **share**  \nNet loss from continuing operations |  $ |  (164,170) |  $ |  (3.09) |  $ |  (12,883) |  $ |  (0.19)  \n_Adjustments:_  \nAmortization of completed technology |  24,770 |  0.47 |  18,494 |  0.28  \nPurchase accounting impact on inventory |  â |  â |  9,664 |  0.15  \nAmortization of intangible assets other than completed technology |  26,500 |  0.50 |  29,884 |  0.45  \nRebranding and transformation costs(1) |  13,856 |  0.26 |  (49) |  â  \nRestructuring charges |  11,808 |  0.22 |  4,577 |  0.07  \nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets |  115,975 |  2.18 |  â |  â  \nContingent consideration - fair value adjustments |  â |  â |  (18,549) |  (0.28)  \nMerger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase(2) |  4,874 |  0.09 |  13,842 |  0.21  \nIndemnification asset release |  â |  â |  (19) |  â  \nTax adjustments(3) |  2,945 |  0.06 |  (8,102) |  (0.12)  \nTax effect of adjustments |  (14,758) |  (0.28) |  (16,260) |  (0.25)  \nOther special charges |  4 |  â |  â |  â  \n**Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations** |  $ |  **21,804** |  $ |  **0.41** |  $ |  **20,599** |  $ |  **0.31**  \n_Stock-based compensation, pre-tax_ |  14,467 |  0.27 |  9,497 |  0.14  \n_Tax rate_ |  _14_ |  _%_ |  â |  _15_ |  _%_ |  â  \nStock-based compensation, net of tax |  12,442 |  0.23 |  8,072 |  0.12  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income excluding stock-based compensation - continuing operations |  $ |  34,246 |  $ |  0.64 |  $ |  28,671 |  $ |  0.43  \nShares used in computing non-GAAP diluted net income per share |  â |  53,175 |  â |  66,253  \n  \n(1) |  Transformation costs represent non-recurring expenses for strategic projects with anticipated long-term benefits to the Company focused on cost reduction and productivity improvement that do not meet the definition of restructuring charges.

Transformation costs in the period result from actions taken as part of the Company's 2024 cost reduction plan, and primarily relate to one time asset write-downs associated with changes in technology, one time inventory write-downs relating to restructuring actions taken in the period, and third-party consulting costs associated with process and systems re-design.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Sample Management Solutions** |  **Multiomics**  \n---|---  \n**Quarter Ended** |  **Quarter Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n_Dollars in thousands_ |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nGAAP gross profit |  $ |  39,541 |  46.6 |  % |  $ |  36,279 |  45.0 |  % |  $ |  38,296 |  46.8 |  % |  $ |  30,043 |  45.5 |  % |  $ |  29,199 |  45.9 |  % |  $ |  26,808 |  43.9 |  %  \n_Adjustments:_  \nAmortization of completed technology |  1,056 |  1.2 |  % |  1,010 |  1.3 |  % |  867 |  1.1 |  % |  1,040 |  1.6 |  % |  1,038 |  1.6 |  % |  1,211 |  2.0 |  %  \nTransformation costs(1) |  145 |  0.2 |  % |  (127) |  (0.2) |  % |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â  \nNon-GAAP adjusted gross profit |  $ |  40,742 |  48.0 |  % |  $ |  37,162 |  46.1 |  % |  $ |  39,163 |  47.9 |  % |  $ |  31,083 |  47.1 |  % |  $ |  30,237 |  47.5 |  % |  $ |  28,019 |  45.8 |  %  \n**B Medical Systems** |  **Total Segments**  \n**Quarter Ended** |  **Quarter Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n_Dollars in thousands_ |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nGAAP gross profit |  $ |  (173) |  (0.9) |  % |  $ |  3,578 |  12.5 |  % |  $ |  2,930 |  10.0 |  % |  $ |  69,413 |  40.8 |  % |  $ |  69,056 |  40.0 |  % |  $ |  68,034 |  39.5 |  %  \n_Adjustments:_  \nAmortization of completed technology |  4,358 |  22.7 |  % |  4,268 |  15.0 |  % |  2,691 |  9.1 |  % |  6,454 |  3.8 |  % |  6,316 |  3.7 |  % |  4,769 |  2.8 |  %  \nPurchase accounting impact on inventory |  â |  â |  â |  â |  927 |  3.1 |  % |  â |  â |  â |  â |  927 |  0.5 |  %  \nTransformation costs(1) |  442 |  2.3 |  % |  2,783 |  9.8 |  % |  â |  â |  588 |  0.3 |  % |  2,656 |  1.5 |  % |  â |  â  \nNon-GAAP adjusted gross profit |  $ |  4,627 |  24.1 |  % |  $ |  10,629 |  37.3 |  % |  $ |  6,548 |  22.3 |  % |  $ |  76,455 |  45.0 |  % |  $ |  78,028 |  45.2 |  % |  $ |  73,730 |  42.8 |  %  \n  \n**Sample Management Solutions** |  **Multiomics**  \n---|---  \n**Year Ended** |  **Year Ended**  \n_Dollars in thousands_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nGAAP gross profit |  $ |  142,035 |  44.6 |  % |  $ |  132,806 |  43.7 |  % |  $ |  115,434 |  45.3 |  % |  $ |  109,820 |  44.2 |  %  \n_Adjustments:_  \nAmortization of completed technology |  3,909 |  1.2 |  % |  2,973 |  1.0 |  % |  4,157 |  1.6 |  % |  4,874 |  2.0 |  %  \nTransformation costs(1) |  377 |  0.1 |  % |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â  \nNon-GAAP adjusted gross profit |  $ |  146,321 |  45.9 |  % |  $ |  135,779 |  44.7 |  % |  $ |  119,591 |  47.0 |  % |  $ |  114,694 |  46.2 |  %  \n**B Medical Systems** |  **Total Segments**  \n**Year Ended** |  **Year Ended**  \n_Dollars in thousands_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nGAAP gross profit |  $ |  5,895 |  7.1 |  % |  $ |  20,514 |  18.1 |  % |  $ |  263,367 |  40.1 |  % |  $ |  263,140 |  39.6 |  %  \n_Adjustments:_ |  $ |  â  \nAmortization of completed technology |  16,704 |  20.1 |  % |  10,647 |  9.4 |  % |  24,770 |  3.8 |  % |  18,494 |  2.8 |  %  \nPurchase accounting impact on inventory |  â |  â |  9,664 |  8.5 |  % |  â |  â |  9,664 |  1.4 |  %  \nTransformation costs(1) |  3,576 |  4.3 |  % |  â |  â |  3,953 |  0.6 |  % |  â |  â  \nOther adjustment |  â |  â |  (1) |  â |  â |  â |  â |  â  \nNon-GAAP adjusted gross profit |  $ |  26,175 |  31.5 |  % |  $ |  40,824 |  36.1 |  % |  $ |  292,090 |  44.5 |  % |  $ |  291,298 |  43.8 |  %  \n  \n(1) |  Transformation costs represent non-recurring expenses for strategic projects with anticipated long-term benefits to the Company focused on cost reduction and productivity improvement that do not meet the definition of restructuring charges.

(Nasdaq: AZTA) today reported\nfinancial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nFiscal Year 2024 Highlights:\nâ Q4'24 revenue growth of 6% reported and 5% organic, in combined Sample Management Solutions and\nMultiomics\nâ FY'24 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 300 basis points versus last year\nQuarter Ended Year Ended\nDollars in millions, except per share September September September September\ndata 30, 30, 30, 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue from Continuing Operations $ 170 $ 172 (1)% $ 656 $ 665 (1)%\nOrganic growth (2)% (2)%\nSample Management Solutions $ 85 $ 82 4% $ 319 $ 304 5%\nMultiomics $ 66 $ 61 8% $ 255 $ 248 3%\nB Medical Systems $ 19 $ 29 (35)% $ 83 $ 113 (27)%\nDiluted EPS Continuing Operations $ (0.10 ) $ 0.05 NM $ (3.09 ) $ (0.19 ) NM\nDiluted EPS Total $ (0.10 ) $ 0.06 NM $ (3.09 ) $ (0.22 ) NM\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS Continuing\nOperations $ 0.18 $ 0.13 47% $ 0.41 $ 0.31 32%\nAdjusted EBITDA Continuing\nOperations $ 17 $ 8 119% $ 49 $ 30 62%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin - Continuing\nOperations 10.2 % 4.6 % 7.5 % 4.6 %\nManagement Comments\nâWe ended fiscal 2024 strong, delivering core revenue growth in our Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics businesses, and\nupholding our commitment to meaningfully expand margins,â stated John Marotta, President and CEO. âWe are proud of the progress\nthat we made in fiscal 2024, particularly in our Transformation Program Ascend 2026, and intend to carry that momentum forward to\ndrive further performance, as proven by our fiscal 2025 guidance, which anticipates core revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%,\nwith continued margin expansion and a renewed focus on free cash flow.\"\nMr. Marotta continued, âAzenta offers a unique portfolio of differentiated products and services and occupies a strong position in the\nmarketplace. Our competitively advantaged portfolio of businesses, coupled with the capabilities of the Value Creation Committee,\nsupported by the full Board, will accelerate our goal of delivering profitable growth and long-term shareholder value creation.â\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results\nâ Revenue was $170 million, down 1% year over year. Organic revenue declined 2% year over year, which excludes the\nimpact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point. The year-over-year revenue decline was attributable to lower B\nMedical Systems (âB Medicalâ) revenue. The combined Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics business segments\ngrew 5% on an organic basis.\nâ Sample Management Solutions revenue was $85 million, up 4% year over year.\no Organic revenue was up 3%, mainly driven by continued strength in Sample Repository Services and Core Products,\nparticularly in Cryogenic Stores and Consumables and Instruments. This was partially offset by a year-over-year\nrevenue decline in Stores.\nâ Multiomics revenue was $66 million, up 8% year over year.\no Organic revenue also grew 8% year over year, primarily driven by growth in Next Generation Sequencing, partially\noffset by a year-over-year decline in Sanger sequencing revenue.\nâ B Medical Systems revenue was $19 million, down 35% year over year.\no Organic revenue also declined 35% year over year, mainly due to lower order volume in the quarter compared to the\nprior year, primarily attributable to timing of orders.\nSummary of GAAP Earnings Results\nâ Operating loss was $12 million. Operating margin increased 240 basis points year over year.\no Gross margin was 40.8%, up 130 basis points year over year, driven by favorable product mix, operational\nefficiencies, and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased amortization and transformation costs.\no Operating expenses were $82 million, down 300 basis points year over year, primarily driven by lower\nselling, general and administrative expenses and lower amortization, partially offset by increased restructuring and\ntransformation costs.\nâ Other income included $6 million of net interest income versus $11 million in the prior year period.\nâ Diluted EPS from continuing operations was ($0.10) compared to $0.05 one year ago.\nSummary of Non-GAAP Earnings Results\nâ Adjusted operating income was $7 million. Operating margin was 4.1%, an improvement of 460 basis points year over year.\no Adjusted gross margin was 45.0%, up 220 basis points year over year, primarily driven by favorable product\nmix, operating efficiencies, and cost reduction initiatives.\no Adjusted operating expense in the quarter was $69 million, down 700 basis points year over year, primarily driven\nby the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and lower commissions on cold chain sales in B Medical.\nâ Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.2 %, up 560 basis points year over year.\nâ Non-GAAP Diluted EPS was $0.18, compared to $0.13 one year ago.\nFull Year Fiscal 2024 Results\nâ Revenue for fiscal 2024 was $656 million, down 1% year over year. Organic revenue declined 2%, which excludes the\nimpact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point and a nominal contribution from acquisitions. The year-over-\nyear revenue decline was attributable to lower B Medical revenue. The combined Sample Management Solutions and\nMultiomics business segments grew 4% on an organic basis.\nâ Sample Management Solutions revenue was $319 million, up 5 % year over year.\no Organic revenue was up 4%. The year-over-year revenue increase was driven by growth in both, the Sample\nRepository Services and Core Products businesses.\nâ Multiomics revenue was $255 million, up 3% year over year.\no Organic revenue also grew 3% year over year, driven by growth in Next Generation Sequencing and Gene Synthesis\nservices, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in Sanger sequencing revenue.\nâ B Medical Systems revenue was $83 million, down 27% year over year.\no Organic revenue was also down 27% year over year, primarily driven by the timing of cold chain equipment orders.\n2\nSummary of GAAP Results\nâ Operating loss was $201 million. Operating margin decreased 19.6% year over year.\no Gross margin was 40.1%, up 60 basis points year over year, primarily driven by favorable product mix, operating\nefficiencies and cost reduction initiatives, as well as purchase accounting impacts on inventory in the prior year\nwhich did not reoccur, partially offset by increased amortization and transformation costs.\no Operating expense was $464 million, up 38% year over year due to a $116 million non-cash impairment of goodwill\nand intangible assets, increased transformation and restructuring charges, and a benefit of $18.5 million of fair value\ncontingent consideration adjustments related to B Medical recognized in the prior fiscal year that did not\nreoccur; these increases were partially offset by lower M&A costs and the benefit of our cost reduction initiatives.\nâ Other income included $33 million of net interest income versus $44 million in the prior year period.\nâ Diluted EPS from continuing operations was ($3.09) compared to ($0.19) in fiscal 2023.\nSummary of Non-GAAP Results\nâ Adjusted operating loss was $3 million and operating margin was (0.4%), an improvement of 190 basis points year over year.\no Adjusted gross margin was 44.5%, up 70 basis points year over year, primarily driven by favorable product mix,\noperating efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by margin pressure from lower revenue in the B\nMedical segment.\no Adjusted operating expense was $295 million, down 400 basis points year over year, primarily driven by the benefit\nof cost reduction initiatives and lower commissions on cold chain sales in B Medical.\nâ Adjusted EBITDA was $49 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.5%, an improvement of about 300 basis points\nyear over year.\nâ Non-GAAP Diluted EPS for fiscal 2024 was $0.41, compared to $0.31 in fiscal 2023.\nCash and Liquidity as of September 30, 2024\nâ The Company ended fiscal year 2024 with a total balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities\nof $522 million.\nâ Capital expenditures were $13 million in the quarter and $38 million for the full year.\nShare Repurchase Program Update\nâ In the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares for approximately $249 million under a\n10b5-1 trading program.\nâ The Company completed the repurchases of its common stock under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization in September 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased and retired 30.0 million shares of common stock for the full $1.5 billion\napproved.\nReview of Statements of Cash Flows\nAs part of the year end closing process, the Company is currently reviewing the classification of amounts, primarily between the line\nitems âeffects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalentsâ and âcash provided by operating activities in the Companyâs\nconsolidated statements of cash flows that could potentially impact those line items in our previously issued statements of cash flows\nfor fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and fiscal 2024 quarterly periods. As a result, the Company has not included statements of\ncash flows in this release. The Companyâs consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations are not impacted by any\nreclassification of these cash flow items for any period. The Company expects to reflect any changes to the previously issued\nstatements of cash flows in its Annual Report of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nGuidance for Continuing Operations for Full Year Fiscal 2025 Excluding B Medical Systems\nâ Total organic revenue is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 5% relative to fiscal 2024.\nâ Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion is expected to be approximately 300 basis points relative to fiscal 2024.\nAzenta does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis for the measures on which it provides forward-looking non-\nGAAP guidance as the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the\nmost directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because of the inherent difficulty in\naccurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliations that have\nnot yet occurred, are dependent on various factors, are out of the company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Such\nadjustments include, but are not limited to, transformation costs, restructuring charges, costs related to acquisitions and divestitures\ncosts, governance-related matters, goodwill and intangible impairments, and other gains and charges that are not representative of the\nnormal operations of the business.\n3\nPursuing Sale of B Medical Systems Segment\nAzenta has announced it is pursuing a sale of its B Medical Systems segment, a manufacturer and global distributor of medical\nrefrigeration devices based in Luxembourg. This action will simplify Azentaâs portfolio and allow management to focus on driving\nrevenue growth and profitability in its core businesses. The decision follows work by the Board of Directors to evaluate strategic,\noperational and financial opportunities to maximize value.\nAzenta does not intend to comment further on the process unless and until the Company has determined a specific course of action or\notherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.\nNames Lawrence Lin Chief Financial Officer\nThe Company has also named Lawrence Y. Lin as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Herman Cueto, effective after the Companyâs\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr.\nCueto will remain as an advisor for a period of time to help facilitate a seamless transition.\nMr. Lin joins Azenta from GeoStabilization International LLC (âGSIâ), a privately held industrial company, and brings over twenty\nyears of finance experience, including previously holding senior finance roles at PHC Holdings and Danaher.\nMr. Marotta commented, âWeâre excited to have Lawrence join the Azenta team. Lawrence is an accomplished finance executive with\na proven track record and a skillset that aligns perfectly with Azentaâs needs for its next phase of transformation.â\nMr. Marotta continued, âWe will benefit from the many significant contributions Herman made during his time at Azenta, including\nnotably, the development of Ascend 2026, which is already driving considerable margin expansion. He played a key role in laying a\nterrific foundation on which to build. We wish him the best going forward.â\nBefore joining GSI, Mr. Lin was Senior Vice President of Finance Operations at PHC Holdings Corporation (TSE: 6523), a leading\ndiversified diagnostic, life sciences and medical device company based in Japan. Prior roles include Vice President of Finance for\nNorth America (CFO) and Global Functions at LivaNova (NYSE: LIVN), a global medical technology company, and Vice President\nof Finance Operations at KaVo Kerr, previously part of Danaher (NYSE: DHR), which was spun off as an independent public\ncompany named Envista (NYSE: NVST) in 2019.

These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, or GAAP. These measures should always be considered in conjunction with appropriate GAAP measures. A reconciliation\nof non-GAAP measures to the most nearly comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release following the\nconsolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. Certain amounts in the tables that supplement the consolidated financial\nstatements may not sum due to rounding. All percentages are calculated using unrounded amounts.\nâSafe Harbor Statementâ under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nSome statements in this release are forward-looking statements made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThese statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause\nAzentaâs financial and business results to differ materially from our expectations.

Transformation costs in the period result from actions taken as part of the Companyâs 2024 cost reduction plan, and\nprimarily relate to one time asset write-downs associated with changes in technology, one time inventory write-downs relating to restructuring actions taken in the\nperiod, and third-party consulting costs associated with process and systems re-design.\n(2) Includes expenses related to governance-related matters.\nSample Management Solutions Multiomics B Medical Systems Azenta Total\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended\nSeptember September September September September September September September\n30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30,\nDollars in millions 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 85 $ 82 4 % $ 66 $ 61 8 % $ 19 $ 29 (35 )% $ 170 $ 172 (1 )%\nAcquisitions/divestitures â â 0 % â â 0 % â â 0 % â â 0 %\nCurrency exchange rates 0 â (0 )% 0 â (0 )% 0 â (1 )% 1 â (0 )%\nOrganic revenue $ 85 $ 82 3 % $ 66 $ 61 8 % $ 19 $ 29 (35 )% $ 169 $ 172 (2 )%\nSample Management Solutions Multiomics B Medical Systems Azenta Total\nYear Ended Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended\nSeptember September September September September September September September\n30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30,\nDollars in millions 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 319 $ 304 5 % $ 255 $ 248 3 % $ 83 $ 113 (27 )% $ 656 $ 665 (1 )%\nAcquisitions/divestitures 1 â (0 )% â â 0 % â â 0 % 1 â (0 )%\nCurrency exchange rates 1 â (0 )% (1 ) â 0 % 1 â (1 )% 1 â (0 )%\nOrganic revenue $ 316 $ 304 4 % $ 255 $ 248 3 % $ 82 $ 113 (27 )% $ 654 $ 665 (2 )%\n13"

Business\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of biological and chemical compound sample exploration and management solutions for the life sciences industry. We\nentered the life sciences market in 2011, leveraging our in-house precision automation and cryogenics capabilities that we were then applying in the\nsemiconductor manufacturing market. This led us to develop and provide solutions for automated ultra-cold storage. Since then, we have expanded our life\nsciences offerings through internal investments and through a series of acquisitions. We now support our customers from research and clinical development\nto commercialization with our sample management, automated storage, vaccine cold storage and transport, as well as genomic services expertise to help\nour customers bring impactful and breakthrough therapies to market faster. We understand the importance of sample integrity and offer a broad portfolio of\nproducts and services supporting customers at every stage of the life cycle of samples, including procurement, automated storage systems, genomic\nservices and a multitude of sample consumables, informatics and data software, along with sample repository services. Our expertise, global footprint, and\nleadership positions enable us to be a trusted global partner to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life sciences research institutions. In total, we employ\napproximately 3,300 full-time employees, part-time employees and contingent workers worldwide as of September 30, 2024 and have sales in\napproximately 125 countries. We are headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts and have operations in North America, Asia and Europe.\nOur Company was founded in 1978 and became a leading automation provider and partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. We\ndivested the last of our semiconductor businesses in February 2022 for $2.9 billion in cash and since operate solely as a life sciences company. On\nDecember 1, 2021, we changed our corporate name from âBrooks Automation, Inc.â to âAzenta, Inc.â and our common stock started to trade on the\nNasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol âAZTAâ. The semiconductor automation results are classified as discontinued operations, and, unless\notherwise noted, the description of our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates solely to our continuing operations.\nOur portfolio includes product and service offerings developed by us internally, as well as obtained through acquisitions, designed to provide\ncomprehensive capabilities to our customers, addressing their needs in sample exploration and management, automated storage, multiomics, and cold chain\nsolutions. We continue to develop new product and service offerings and enhance existing and acquired offerings through the expertise of our research and\ndevelopment resources.

Public health threats, whether global or not, may adversely impact our\nbusiness and markets, including our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers, and business partners. In particular, we may\nexperience material financial or operational impacts, including:\nâ significant volatility or reductions in demand for our products and/or services; or\nâ the inability to meet our customersâ needs or other obligations due to disruptions to our operations or the operations of our third-party\npartners, suppliers, contractors, logistics partners, or customers.\nThese impacts may be of greater magnitude in certain jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate that are impacted by these threats or react to\nthe threats with more stringent policies. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols,\nbusiness continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact health threats on our employees and our\nbusiness, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts or that such efforts may not have detrimental unintended consequences, and as\na result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by health threats and epidemics.\n11\nTable of Contents\nGlobal climate change and related legal and regulatory developments could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nClimate change presents risks to us and to our customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Our products and services are subject to and\naffected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our\ninternational operations. Future regulations or voluntary actions on our part in response to climate change could result in costly changes to our facilities to\nreduce carbon emissions and could increase energy costs as a result of switching to less carbon-intensive, but more expensive, sources of energy to operate\nour facilities and to transport and ship products and samples. There can be no assurance that climate change or environmental regulation and response will\nnot have a negative competitive impact on our ability to provide sample management, automated storage, and genomic services or that economic returns\nwill match the investments that we are making in the development of new products and services. We will likely face increasing complexity related to\nproduct design, the use of regulated materials, energy consumption and efficiency, and the reuse, recycling, or disposal of products and their components at\nend-of-use or useful life. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty regarding future\nincentives for energy-efficiency and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products and services, our costs associated with providing\nour products and services, and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our\noperations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in global\nweather patterns, which could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing\ntemperature averages or extremes. These impacts may also adversely affect our properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact our significant foreign currency holdings, lead to lower operating margins, or may cause\nus to raise prices for our products and services, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales, cost of sales and results of operations, and we could experience losses\nwith respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices for our products\nand services to customers, which could result in lower net sales. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products and services in response to\nunfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations, including our margins, could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made\nby our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold or these services are provided and the currency\nreceived in payment for such sales could be less valuable as compared to the U.S. dollar at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.\nFrom time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swap agreements to reduce currency exposure. However, we cannot be\ncertain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange\nrate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $124 million of cash and cash equivalents that is denominated in foreign currency, which represents\na substantial portion of our current cash and cash equivalents balance. As a result of our significant foreign currency holdings, our financial results and\ncapital ratios may be impacted by the movements in exchange rates, and a significant portion of our assets must be translated into U.S. dollars for external\nreporting purposes or converted into U.S. dollars to meet our strategic needs, and service obligations such as any future U.S. dollar-denominated\nindebtedness or dividends. We may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, but our efforts may not be successful.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.\nThere has been an increased focus from investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, including addressing climate\nchange, which may result in increases in our costs to operate our business or restrict certain aspects of our activities. The standards by which ESG efforts\nand related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time and the extent and\nseverity of climate change impacts are unknown. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting\nresponsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position\nand cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur operating results could fluctuate significantly, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur revenue, operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending upon a\nvariety of factors, including:\nâ changes in the timing and terms of product orders and service contracts by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise;\nâ changes in the demand for the mix of products and services that we offer;\n12\nTable of Contents\nâ the timing and amount of any new repurchases of our common stock;\nâ the timing and market acceptance of our new product and service introductions;\nâ delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products or services, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to\ncustomers or the quality of such services;\nâ new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors, which can, among other things, render our products and services less\ncompetitive due to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we provide products and services;\nâ the timing and related costs of any acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions;\nâ our ability to reduce our costs in response to decreased demand for our products and services;\nâ our ability to accurately estimate customer demand, including the accuracy of demand forecasts used by us;\nâ disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us;\nâ write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory;\nâ competitive pricing pressures; and\nâ increased investment into our infrastructure to support our growth, including capital equipment, research and development, as well as selling and\nmarketing initiatives to support continuous product and services innovation, technological capability enhancements and sales efforts. The timing\nof revenue generation coupled with the increased amount of investment may result in operating losses.\nAs a result of these risks, we believe that reference to past performance for comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful,\nand that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.\nIf we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely and effective manner, our products and\nservices may become obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to respond to the technological changes present in the markets we serve. The success of our product\ndevelopment and introduction of products and services to market depends on our ability to:\nâ identify and define new market opportunities, products and services in an accurate manner;\nâ obtain market acceptance of our products and services;\nâ innovate, develop, acquire and commercialize new technologies and applications in a timely and cost effective manner;\nâ adjust to changing market conditions;\nâ differentiate our offerings from our competitorsâ offerings;\nâ obtain and maintain intellectual property rights where necessary;\n13\nTable of Contents\nâ continue to develop a comprehensive, integrated product and service strategy;\nâ price our products and services appropriately; and\nâ design our products to high standards of manufacturability so that they meet customer requirements.\nIf we cannot succeed in responding in a timely and cost effective manner to technological and/or market changes or if the new products and services\nthat we introduce do not achieve market acceptance, our competitive position would diminish which could materially harm our business and our prospects.\nIf we do not achieve our transformation initiative goals, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we announced a transformation initiative to reduce complexity and streamline processes across our organization designed to lead to\nreduced costs and increased profitability. We have identified initiatives and activities to support the objectives of the transformation initiative. If we fail to\ncomplete any of these initiatives or activities, or if the results of these initiatives and activities do not lead to the cost savings we expect, our financial\nresults could be negatively impacted.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks.\nDuring fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 44%, 46% and 33% of our revenue was derived from sales outside of\nNorth America. We expect that international sales, including increased sales in Asia and Africa, will continue to account for a significant portion of our\nrevenue for the foreseeable future, and that in particular, the proportion of our sales to customers in China will increase, due in large part to our significant\ngenomic services operation in China. Additionally, we intend to invest additional resources in facilities in China, which will increase our global footprint of\nsales, service and repair operations. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties, including:\nâ longer sales-cycles and time to collection;\nâ tariff and international trade barriers;\nâ fewer or less certain legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad;\nâ different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\nâ government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\nâ a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing\nemployment practices and labor issues;\nâ an increased reliance on third-party agents and distributors to transact business in jurisdictions where we do not have a presence;\n14\nTable of Contents\nâ fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, particularly in Asia and Europe;\nâ political and economic instability, changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate; and\nâ intervention or attempts to control our international operations by foreign governments, including our Suzhou China facility by the government of\nChina.\nMoreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there is an increased risk of corruption and/or bribery, which\ncould lead to violations of various laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While such business practices are prohibited by our\ninternal policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that all our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we\noutsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies and procedures, or the applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. Any such\nviolations could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition\nand cash flows.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay\nof orders already placed, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could\nmaterially harm our business and profitability.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $146 million of cash outside the United States and our ability to repatriate any of the funds for use\nin the United States or elsewhere in our business may be limited based on local country statutory requirements, which could negatively impact our\nopportunities to deploy capital.\nOur business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products, services\nand/or technologies. Our acquisitions, present numerous risks, including:\nâ difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of\nthe combined businesses;\nâ defining and executing a comprehensive product and services strategy;\nâ managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience;\nâ the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of ours or of acquired companies;\nâ unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target companyâs products or\ninfringement of another companyâs intellectual property by a target companyâs activities, products or services;\nâ problems associated with compliance with the acquired companyâs existing contracts;\nâ difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;\nâ the diversion of managementâs attention from normal daily operations of the business; and\nâ difficulties in accurately estimating the expected demand for any acquired product, service or technology and the timing and regularity thereof.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIf we acquire a new business, we may expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our\noperations and be dilutive to our stockholders. In periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related\nintangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.\nThe failure to adequately address these risks or the impairment of any assets could materially harm our business and financial results.\nExpanding within current markets introduces new competitors and commercial risks.\nA key part of our growth strategy is to continue expanding within the life science products and services markets. As part of this strategy, we expect to\ndiversify our product sales and service revenue by leveraging our core technologies and making acquisitions of select businesses, products, services or\ntechnologies, which requires investments and resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that we will be\nsuccessful in leveraging our capabilities into the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets or identifying and successfully acquiring\nother businesses, products, services or technologies to meet all the needs of new customers and to compete favorably with other products and services.\nBecause a significant portion of our growth potential may be dependent on our ability to increase sales within each of the Sample Management Solutions,\nMultiomics, and B Medical Systems segments, our inability to successfully expand within the markets serviced by these segments may adversely impact\nfuture financial results.\nChanges in key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy.\nThe continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering, scientific and management personnel, together with our ability to attract and\nretain such personnel, is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy. There is substantial competition to attract such employees and\nthe loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The same could be true if we were to\nexperience a high turnover rate among engineering and scientific personnel and we were unable to replace them. Our ability to attract and retain employees\nmay be negatively impacted by employeesâ reactions to our policies, related to working remotely, particularly in the United States. Any failure to attract,\nrecruit, train, retain, motivate and integrate qualified personnel, in particular our new President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President\nand Chief Financial Officer, could materially harm our strategic plan, operating results and growth prospects.\nJohn Marotta joined us as President, Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of Directors on September 9, 2024 to succeed Dr. Stephen\nSchwartz, who previously announced his retirement after more than 14 years of service to us. In addition, on November 12, 2024, Lawrence Lin was\nappointed as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to succeed Herman Cueto\nin this role. Although we have taken steps to help ensure a smooth and successful transition, there can be no assurance that these steps will be successful.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our sample storage operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nUnexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist\nactivities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nOur customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve and transport their critical samples, and these events could result in service disruptions,\nphysical damage to one or more key storage facilities and the customer samples stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key\noperating facilities or the temporary disruption of service, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. Our primary\nstorage facility is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, an area of the United States that can be prone to tornadoes and other severe weather events.\nIf our facilities were to experience a significant disruption in operations, our business could be materially harmed, while the failure to estimate\ncustomer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing facilities for our products and laboratories for our service offerings. If the operations at any one of these\nfacilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster, fire, power or other utility outage, work stoppage, war or terrorist activities or other similar event,\nour business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts, or provide services, to our customers in a\ntimely fashion. The impact of any disruption at one of our facilities may be exacerbated if the disruption occurs at a time when we need to rapidly increase\nour capabilities to meet increased demand or expedited shipment schedules.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, if actual demand for our products or services is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer component parts or other supplies than\nnecessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of such parts or supplies. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer\ndemand that does not materialize, or if our customers reduce or delay orders, we may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on certain critical information systems and a failure or breach of such a system could harm our business and results of operations\nand, in the event of unauthorized access to a customerâs data or our data, incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nWe utilize certain critical information technology systems and networks, including those provided by third parties, to process, transmit and store\nelectronic information in connection with our business, and more broadly for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include\ntelecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail. These\ninformation systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or other third parties such as vendors and contractors. As the use of\ndigital technologies has increased, cybersecurity incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and\nnetworks, have increased in frequency and sophistication, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. These threats pose a risk to the security of our\nsystems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, reliability, adequacy, and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in preventing or detecting cybersecurity incidents and attacks, or successfully mitigating their effects.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and those provided to us by third parties are vulnerable to\ndamage or disruption from hacking, computer viruses, malware, including ransomware, software bugs, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism,\nwar, and telecommunication, equipment, and electrical failures. Our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or\nunauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential or proprietary information, or personal data, could unfavorably impact our reputation and the timely\nand efficient operation of our business.\nWe have measures in place that are designed to prevent, and if necessary, to detect and respond to such cybersecurity incidents and breaches of privacy\nand security mandates. Our measures to prevent, detect, respond to, and minimize such risks may be unsuccessful. While we have not, to our knowledge,\nexperienced any significant system failure, accident, or material cybersecurity incident to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our\noperations or the operations of those third parties with which we contract, it could result in legal harm and a material disruption of our programs and our\nbusiness operations, as well as our financial condition. To the extent that any disruption or cybersecurity incident results in a loss of or damage to our data\nor applications, or inappropriate disclosure, loss, corruption, modification, or theft of confidential or proprietary information, or personal data, in addition\nto incurring liability, the further development of our products and services could be delayed, or our competitive position could be compromised.\nAdditionally, such disruptions or cybersecurity incidents could result in enforcement actions by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, regulatory\npenalties, and other legal liabilities such as but not limited to private litigation, the incurrence of significant remediation costs, disruptions to our\ndevelopment programs, business operations and collaborations, diversion of management efforts and damage to our reputation, all of which could harm our\nbusiness and operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which led to a conclusion that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is not effective as of September 30, 2024. Our ability to remediate the material weakness, the discovery of additional material\nweaknesses, and our inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, could\nadversely affect our results of operations, our stock price and investor confidence in our company.\nPursuant to SEC rules and regulations, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The\nrules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant\ndocumentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis\nthat we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could\nresult in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal\ncontrol deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 as we did not design and maintain effective\ncontrols related to the review of the cash flow statement. The material weakness resulted in immaterial misstatements in our Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows for the Q2 and Q3 interim periods during fiscal 2023, for the year ended September 30, 2023, as well as the Q1, Q2, and Q3 interim periods\nduring fiscal 2024 and in our supplemental cash flow disclosures for the year ended September 30, 2022, each interim and annual period during fiscal 2023\nand the Q1, Q2 and Q3 interim periods during fiscal 2024. Additionally, the material weakness could result in material misstatements of our interim or\nannual consolidated statement of cash flows or supplemental cash flow disclosures that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of a companyâs annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our\nmanagement may be unable to conclude in future periods that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective due to the effects of various factors,\nwhich may, in part, include unremediated material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOur management has taken, and plans to take, actions to remediate the deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting and will implement\nnew processes, procedures and controls designed to address the underlying causes associated with the material weakness. While we expect to continue to\nimplement our remediation plans throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, we cannot be certain as to when the remediation of this material\nweakness will be fully completed. During the course of completing our remedial actions, we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be\nrequired to design additional enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this process. In addition, there can be no assurance that\nsuch remediation efforts will be successful, that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a\nresult of these efforts or that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods.\nIf we fail to remediate this material weakness or otherwise not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial\nreporting, we may not be able to rely on the integrity of our financial results or otherwise provide reliable financial statements, which could adversely affect\nour business decisions, result in inaccurate or late reporting of our financial results, as well as delays or the inability to meet our reporting obligations or to\ncomply with SEC rules and regulations. Any of these could result in delisting actions by the Nasdaq Stock Market, investigation and sanctions by\nregulatory authorities, stockholder investigations and lawsuits, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, ability to obtain financing and\nthe trading price of our common stock.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $691.4 million of goodwill and $248.0 million in net intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions. We\nperiodically review our goodwill and the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances\nthat might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. These events and circumstances include significant changes\nin the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, advances in technology and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life\ncould have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the event the performance of any of our reporting units does not meet management expectations in the future, we experience a prolonged\nmacroeconomic or market downturn, or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions used in the analyses used to estimate fair value, we may be\nrequired to perform an impairment analysis which could result in an impairment charge. As of October 1, 2023, we reorganized the business under three\noperating segments, and as a result, reallocated goodwill to the newly defined reporting units. Subsequent to this reallocation, during the second quarter of\nfiscal year 2024, as part of our routine long-term planning process, we assessed several events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs\nused to determine the fair value of our reporting units, including updates to forecasted cash flows, the impact of our cost saving plans and planned\ntransformation initiatives and the overall change in the economic climate since our last impairment assessment in October 2023. We concluded it was more\nlikely than not the fair value of the B Medical Systems segment was less than its carrying amount resulting from the reduction in our anticipated revenue\ngrowth rates for the current and subsequent years as compared to prior projections. As a result, we completed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for\nour reporting units in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350, Intangibles â Goodwill as of March 31, 2024. We recorded a non-cash\nimpairment charge of $111.3 million within \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\" in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024. For further details refer to Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements included under Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any additional\nimpairment charges could negatively impact our business and stock price as set forth above.\n18\nTable of Contents\nChanges in tax rates or tax regulation could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and\nestimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the\nfollowing: applicable tax laws; composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; and/or establishment of a valuation allowance against\ndeferred tax assets based on the assessment of their realizability prior to expiration. Changes in applicable tax laws could significantly impact the estimates\nof our tax assets and liabilities, as well as expectations of future effective tax rates. Changes in tax laws could also negatively impact our ability to move\nour cash balances between the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\nand state, local and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to\ndetermine the adequacy of our expense for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final\ndetermination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax (benefits) expenses and accruals, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational trade disputes could result in additional or increased tariffs, export controls or other trade restrictions that may have a material impact on\nour business.\nWe sell a significant number of products outside the United States, including in China and Africa. Based on the complex relationships among these\ncountries and the United States, there is inherent risk that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or\ndisruptions. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on\ncertain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact customer demand and\ncustomer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or\ninhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nIn addition, a portion of the manufacturing for our products and providing services takes place in China through third-party manufacturers and service\nproviders. The BIOSECURE Act that was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives is aimed at discouraging federal contracting with certain\nChinese biotechnology companies for biotechnology equipment or services. If the BIOSECURE Act becomes law, its implementation has the potential to\nimpact supply of our products and services. Additionally, if following the enactment and implementation of the BIOSECURE ACT we are required to\nchange manufacturers or service providers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer or provider maintains facilities and\nprocedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We anticipate that the complexity of our processes may\nimpact the amount of time it may take to secure a replacement manufacturer or provider and such delays could negatively affect our ability to develop and\nsell products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations, regulations relating to the design and operation of\nour products and control systems and regulations relating to certain of our service offerings, including those described under Item 1 âBusiness-\nEnvironmental Matters and Governance Regulationsâ above. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and\nemissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used, and that our GLP regulatory services in our\nMultiomics business are performed in accredited and certified laboratories. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products and\nestablish and maintain our laboratories to comply with these regulations. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to\nmodify or redesign some products, change our service offerings, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. If we do not comply with current or\nfuture regulations, directives, and standards:\nâ we could be subject to fines;\nâ our production or shipments could be suspended; and\nâ we could be prohibited from offering particular products or services in specified markets.\nAny of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation\nand/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our business.\nWe are subject to domestic and international data protection laws and regulations that address privacy and data security and may affect our collection,\nuse, storage, and transfer of personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there\nhas been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and\nregulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the\ncollection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations,\nwhere applicable, could result in government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse\npublicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or\nCCPA, which went into effect in January of 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal\ninformation, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA\nprovides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Although the CCPA\nincludes exemptions for certain categories of health information, the law may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other\npersonal information we collect about California residents. Additionally in 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA,\nwhich went into full effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly amended the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty, additional costs and\nexpenses in an effort to comply and additional potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. Among other things, the CPRA established a new\nregulatory authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is tasked with enacting new regulations under the CPRA and has expanded\nenforcement authority. In addition to California, more U.S. states are enacting similar legislation, increasing compliance complexity and increasing risks of\nfailures to comply. In 2023, comprehensive privacy laws in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah all took effect, and laws in Montana, Oregon, and\nTexas take effect during 2024. In addition, laws in other U.S. states are set to take effect beyond 2024, and additional U.S. states have proposals under\nconsideration, all of which are likely to increase our regulatory compliance costs and risks, exposure to regulatory enforcement action, and other liabilities.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. For example,\nthe European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy framework called the General Data\nProtection Regulation (\"GDPR\") which took effect in May 2018 and governs the collection and use of personal data in the European Union, including by\ncompanies outside of the European Union. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the\nindividuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach\nnotification, and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer\nof personal data out of the European Union to the United States, enhances enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including\nthe potential for fines of up to â¬20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private\nright of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain\ncompensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR has been and will continue to be a rigorous and time-\nintensive process that has increased and will continue to increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite\nthose efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with any European activities, which\ncould adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, following the United Kingdomâs withdrawal from the European Union (i.e., Brexit), and the expiry of the Brexit transition period, which\nended on December 31, 2020, the GDPR has been implemented in the United Kingdom (as the UK GDPR). The UK GDPR sits alongside the UK Data\nProtection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the EU GDPR into UK law. Under the UK GDPR, companies not established in the UK but\nwho process personal data in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the UK, or to monitor their behavior will be subject to the UK\nGDPR â the requirements of which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and\noperational costs with potential fines of up to Â£17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.\nApplicable data privacy and data protection laws may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction, we\nmay find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the past and may not\nin the future. That could require us to incur significant expenses, which could significantly affect our business. Failure to comply with data protection laws\nmay expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities or other regulatory agencies, private rights of action in some jurisdictions,\nand potential significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Furthermore, the number of government investigations related to data security\nincidents and privacy violations continue to increase and government investigations typically require significant resources and generate negative publicity,\nwhich could harm our business and reputation.\nRegulations and customer demands related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use in components of our products\nof âconflict mineralsâ mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, whether the components of our products are manufactured\nby us or third parties. This requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our\nproducts. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements and customer requests, such as costs related to\nour due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and preparing and filing required reports with respect thereto with\nthe SEC. We may face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free\nand/or free of numerous other hazardous materials.\n20\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations.\nOur ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws, confidentiality\nagreements and procedures, copyrights, trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws\noffer only limited protection. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products and services both in the\nUnited States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents\ncovering our products, services, and technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the\nrights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our products and services are\nor may be developed, manufactured, provided, or sold may not fully protect our products and services. Due to the rapid technological change that\ncharacterizes the life sciences and related process equipment industries, we believe that the improvement of existing technology, reliance upon trade\nsecrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and the development of new products or services may be as important as patent protection in establishing and\nmaintaining a competitive advantage. To protect trade secrets and know-how, it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter\ninto nondisclosure agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our\ntechnology. Other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. In the future, it\nmay be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity\nand scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention\nof our management and technical personnel from our business operations.\nThe expiration of our patents over time could lead to an increase in competition and a decline in our revenue.\nOne of our main competitive strengths is our technology, and we are dependent on our patent rights and other intellectual property rights to maintain\nour competitive position. Our patents began to expire at various dates beginning in 2024 and will continue to expire from time to time thereafter through\n2042 which could result in increased competition and declines in product and service revenue.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could\nresult in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.\nThere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we do business. We have in the\npast been, and may in the future be, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. We cannot guarantee that\ninfringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end-users of our products and services resulting from infringement\nclaims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions, whether or not proven to be true, will not materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products or services so that they no longer infringe the rights\nof others. We also cannot guarantee that licenses will be available or the terms of any licenses we may be required to obtain will be reasonable. Similarly,\nchanging our products, services or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our\nproducts and services. If a judgment of infringement were obtained against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an\norder preventing us from selling one or more of our products or offering certain of our services. Further, the cost and diversion of management attention\nbrought about by such litigation could be substantial, even if we were to prevail. Any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may\nmaterially harm our business and our prospects.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nOur business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to continuously deliver key components of acceptable cost and quality.\nWe currently obtain many of our key components on an as-needed, purchase order basis from numerous suppliers. In some cases, we have only a\nsingle source of supply for key components and materials used in the manufacturing of our products. Further, a portion of our supply is sourced from Asia,\nincluding China, and we do not always have a previous history of dealing with these suppliers. Our inability to obtain components or materials in required\nquantities or of acceptable cost and quality and with the necessary continuity of supply could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our\ncustomers. In addition, if a supplier or sub-supplier suffers a production stoppage or delay for any reason, including natural disasters or health-related\nthreats, this could result in a delay or reduction in our product shipments to our customers. Any of these contingencies could cause us to lose customers,\nresult in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of certain key raw materials and natural resources used in our products and various manufacturing processes, and\nwe rely on third parties to supply us with these materials in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to raw materials may be adversely affected if our\nsuppliersâ operations were disrupted as a result of limited or delayed access to key raw materials and natural resources which may result in increased cost\nof these items.\nOur external service providers may fail to perform as we expect or may suffer cybersecurity breaches.\nOur external service providers have played and will continue to play a key role in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as\ninformation technology and facilities management. Many of these service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for\nthe storage and processing of confidential, proprietary, or personal information, employ various processing and storage technologies, including cloud\ncomputing technology. These providersâ information technology systems may be susceptible to cybersecurity incidents and breaches, attacks by hackers, or\nother incidents, including those due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, which are outside of our control. Although we attempt to select\nreputable providers, perform diligence on such providers, and enter into written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to\nperform or adequately protect our data from cybersecurity incidents as we expect, and any such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. Any\nsuch incident could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt\nour operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in us and our ability to conduct our business and our competitive advantage, which\ncould adversely affect our reputation.\nRisks Relating to Our Customers\nCustomers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time.\nSales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term commitments and contracts. Our customers\nfrequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time.\nAccordingly, we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe may face claims for liability related to damages of customer materials attributed to the failure of our products or services, exposing us to significant\nfinancial or reputational harm.\nOur automated cold storage systems are used in the handling, movement and storage of biological and chemical samples. We also provide sample\nstorage services to customers where we store their biological and chemical samples or perform genomic services at our facilities. In any case, in addition to\nproduct warranty claims, inaccurate or faulty testing services or damage to our customersâ materials attributed to a failure of our products or services could\nlead to additional claims for damages made by our customers and could also harm our relationship with our customers and damage our reputation, resulting\nin material harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Securities\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2023 through the end of fiscal year 2024, our stock\nprice fluctuated between a high of $67.51 per share and a low of $36.45 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be\nindicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock\nprice may include:\nâ variations in operating results from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year;\nâ changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analystsâ expectations;\nâ changes in the market price per share of our public company customers and competitors;\nâ the completion of repurchases of our common stock under our 2022 share repurchase authorization;\nâ the timing and amount of any new repurchases of our common stock;\nâ market conditions in the life sciences sample management and genomic services and other industries into which we sell products and services;\nâ global economic conditions;\nâ political changes, hostilities, public health threats, or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods;\nâ low trading volume of our common stock;\nâ the number of firms making a market in our common stock; and\nâ actions of activist stockholders and our response(s) thereto.\nIn addition, the stock market has in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the\nmarket prices of the securities of life sciences companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected by securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could impact the trading price and\nvolatility of our common stock and may constrain capital deployment opportunities and adversely impact our ability to expand our business.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or from continued stockholder activism,\nwhich could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder the execution of our business and growth strategy, constrain our capital deployment\nopportunities, and impact the price of our common stock. Stockholder activism, which can take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been\nincreasing recently. Volatility in the price of our common stock, our cash balance, our financial performance or other reasons may cause us to become the\ntarget of securities litigation or continue to be the target of stockholder activism.\nWe have been and may continue to be subject to stockholder activism, including relating to the actions of Politan Capital Management LP, or Politan,\ndescribed in the Schedule 13D that it initially filed with the SEC on September 14, 2023, as amended, and may be subject to continued and other\nstockholder activism in the future. For example, on November 1, 2024, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Politan pursuant to which we\nagreed, among other things: (a) to increase the size of the Board of Directors by three (3) directors and appoint Quentin Koffey, the Managing Partner and\nChief Investment Officer of Politan, to our Board of Directors; (b) to establish a new Value Creation Committee of the Board of Directors, or the\nCommittee; (c) to appoint Mr. Koffey, William Cornog, Alan Malus, Martin Madaus and John Marotta to the Committee; (d) to appoint Mr. Koffey to the\nHuman Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors; (e) to nominate the members of the Committee for election to the Board of\nDirectors at our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and (f) that two directors serving on the Board of Directors immediately prior to the execution of\nthe Cooperation Agreement would not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Perceived uncertainties\nas to our future direction as a result of these actions or any future stockholder activism or further changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or\nmanagement may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity, any of which could negatively impact\nour stock price and results of operations.\nSecurities litigation and stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert managementâs and our\nBoard of Directorâs attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and stockholder activism could give rise to perceived\nuncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nAlso, we have and may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist stockholder matters.\nFurther, the price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties\nof any securities litigation and stockholder activism. In addition, stockholder activism may constrain our capital deployment opportunities and may limit\nthe types of investments that are available to us.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of your shares.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us\nwithout the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent, the inability of\nstockholders to call special meetings, requiring advance notice in accordance with our by-laws for stockholder proposals that can only be acted upon at\nannual stockholder meetings and nominations to our Board of Directors, limiting the approval of changes in the number of directors to our Board of\nDirectors or by a super majority vote of our stockholders and the potential for super majority votes of our stockholders in certain other circumstances. In\naddition, as discussed below, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the\nstock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In\ngeneral, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a âbusiness combinationâ with an âinterested\nstockholderâ for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business\ncombination is approved in a prescribed manner. Our restated certificate of incorporation also contains anti-greenmail provisions which prohibit us from\nrepurchasing our common stock from certain related persons unless specific conditions are satisfied. These provisions could discourage others from\nbidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise\noccur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nAlthough we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of\nDirectors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed\nor prevented by these provisions, the market price of our common stock could decline.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue from time to time, without further\nstockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and\nrestrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation\npreferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our designation\nand issuance of preferred stock, including in connection with the adoption of a stockholders rights plan, or âpoison pill,â may have the effect of delaying or\npreventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of\ncommon stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock\ncould have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\nOur by-laws designate the state courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be\ninitiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors, officers and employees.\nOur by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and\nexclusive forum for the following types of proceedings:\nâ any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nâ any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or stockholders to our company or our\nstockholders;\nâ any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our by-\nlaws; or\nâ any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware.\nThese choice of forum provisions will not apply to causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which\nfederal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, our by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any claims under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for\ndisputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nadditional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\n25\nTable of Contents\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management\nWe have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical\nsystems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program is an element of and is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management\nprogram, and is a key component of our annual organizational risk assessment. Our cybersecurity risk management program is based in part on, and\nincorporates elements of, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and International Organization for\nStandardization 27001 (ISO 27001) Framework. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional approach that\nis focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating\ncybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program utilizes a variety of technical and process controls that are designed to identify, protect against, detect,\nrespond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats, including:\nâ risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader\nenterprise information technology (âITâ) environment;\nâ a security team that is principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls and policies,\nand (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\nâ the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test, or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\nâ cybersecurity awareness training for our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management;\nâ assessment of material cybersecurity risks posed by third-party service providers, including risks to employee, customer and financial\ninformation;\nâ a cybersecurity incident response protocol that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\nâ business continuity plans.\nAs part of the above processes, we engage, as necessary, consultants and other third parties, to review our cybersecurity incidents if material to help\nquantify the impact and identify areas for continued focus, improvement, and compliance.\nOur processes also address cybersecurity threat risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including our suppliers and manufacturers\nor who have access to confidential, proprietary, personal, or employee data, or to our systems. In addition, cybersecurity considerations affect the selection\nand oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform diligence on third parties that have access to our systems, data or facilities that house such\nsystems or data, and continually monitor cybersecurity threat risks identified through such diligence. Additionally, we generally require those third parties\nthat could introduce significant cybersecurity risk to us to agree by contract to manage their cybersecurity risks in specified ways, and to agree to be subject\nto cybersecurity audits or audits for System and Organization Controls (SOC) compliance.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to cybersecurity risks and incidents related to our business. We have not experienced any material\ncybersecurity incidents during the last fiscal year. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see Item 1A â Risk Factors of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n26\nTable of Contents\nGovernance\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its enterprise risk management oversight function. The Board delegates oversight of the cybersecurity\nrisk management program to the Audit Committee. This oversight includes periodic reports from management concerning cybersecurity related risks. The\nmanagement of the program is the responsibility of our Risk Management Committee, comprised of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Digital &\nInformation Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and General Counsel. Our Chief Digital & Information Officer, who has over 30 years of\nextensive work experience in the field of technology and cybersecurity, leads our team of cybersecurity professionals and provides the Risk Management\nCommittee with periodic reports on our cybersecurity risks and any material cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals monitors the\nprevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through the cybersecurity risk management and processes described above,\nincluding the operation of our incident response plan. The Risk Management Committee provides updates to the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement program as appropriate, including updates on (1) any critical cybersecurity risks; (2) ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies; (3)\napplicable regulatory requirements; and (4) industry standards. The Risk Management Committee also notifies the Board of any significant and/or material\ncybersecurity incidents (suspected or actual) and provides updates on the incidents as well as cybersecurity risk mitigation activities as appropriate.\nItem 2.

The Company believes that its facilities are in good physical condition, are suitable and adequate for the operations conducted\nat those facilities and are generally fully utilized and operating at normal capacity.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the ultimate\noutcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. However, as of the date of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In the\nevent of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that our\nassessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time-to-time, have a material adverse\neffect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nItem 4.

We\nentered the life sciences market in 2011, leveraging our in-house precision automation and cryogenics capabilities that we were then applying in the\nsemiconductor manufacturing market. This led us to develop and provide solutions for automated ultra-cold storage. Since then, we have expanded our life\nsciences offerings through internal investments and through a series of acquisitions. We now support our customers from research and clinical development\nto commercialization with our sample management, automated storage, vaccine cold storage and transport, as well as genomic services expertise to help\nour customers bring impactful and breakthrough therapies to market faster. We understand the importance of sample integrity and offer a broad portfolio of\nproducts and services supporting customers at every stage of the life cycle of samples including procurement, automated storage systems, genomic services\nand a multitude of sample consumables, informatics and data software, along with sample repository services. Our expertise, global footprint and\nleadership positions enable us to be a trusted global partner to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences research institutions. In total, we employ\napproximately 3,300 full-time employees, part-time employees and contingent workers worldwide as of September 30, 2024 and have sales in\napproximately 125 countries. We are headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts and have operations in North America, Asia, and Europe.\nOur portfolio includes product and service offerings developed by us internally, as well as obtained through acquisitions, designed to provide\ncomprehensive capabilities to our customers, addressing their needs in sample exploration and management, automated storage, multiomics, and cold chain\nsolutions. We continue to develop new product and service offerings and enhance existing and acquired offerings through the expertise of our research and\ndevelopment resources. We believe our acquisition, investment and integration approach has allowed us to accelerate internal development and\nsignificantly accelerate time to market for our life sciences solutions.\nSegments\nEffective October 1, 2023, we realigned our organizational structure into three reportable segments: Sample Management Solutions, Multiomics, and B\nMedical Systems. The segment realignment had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. All segment\ninformation presented is reflective of this new structure and prior period information has been recast to conform to our current period presentation. For\nfurther information on our reportable and operating segments, please refer to Note 18, Segment and Geographic Information to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements included under Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10âK.\nWithin our Sample Management Solutions segment, we operate as a single business unit offering end-to-end sample management products and\nservices, including Sample Repository Services, or SRS, and Core Products (Automated Stores, Cryogenic Systems, Automated Sample Tube,\nConsumables and Instruments, and Controlled Rate Thawing Devices). This portfolio provides customers with a high level of sample quality, security,\navailability, intelligence and integrity throughout the lifecycle of samples, providing customers with complete end-to-end âcold chain of custodyâ\ncapabilities. We also offer expert-level consultation services to our clients throughout their experimental design and implementation processes. On July 1,\n2022, we acquired Barkey Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries, or âBarkeyâ, a leading provider of controlled rate thawing devices for customers in the\nmedical, biotech and pharmaceutical industries. The acquisition added innovative products and capabilities that extend our extensive cold chain of\ncondition portfolio of products and services, while also expanding our customer reach in the fast-growing CGT space.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWithin our Multiomics segment, our genomic services business advances research and development activities by providing gene sequencing, synthesis,\nediting and related services. We offer a comprehensive, global portfolio that we believe has both broad appeal in the life sciences industry and enables\ncustomers to select the best solution for their research and development challenges. This portfolio also offers unique solutions for key markets such as\nCGT, antibody development and biomarker discovery by addressing genomic complexity and throughput challenges.\nWithin our B Medical Systems segment, we provide temperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions that complement our cold chain\ncapabilities, adding differentiated solutions for reliable and traceable transport of temperature-sensitive specimens worldwide. We offer end-to-end cold\nchain of custody capabilities for vaccines, blood components, and laboratory specimens through our portfolio of cold chain transport solutions, plasma\nfreezers, contact shock freezers, ultra-low freezers, and real-time sample monitoring and location tracking solutions.\nBusiness and Financial Performance\nOur performance for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenue $ 656,323 $ 665,072 $ 555,498\nCost of revenue 392,956 401,932 299,914\nGross profit 263,367 263,140 255,584\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 33,525 33,956 27,542\nSelling, general and administrative 302,737 316,282 251,465\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets 115,975 â â\nContingent consideration - fair value adjustments â (18,549) 600\nRestructuring charges 11,808 4,577 712\nTotal operating expenses 464,045 336,266 280,319\nOperating loss (200,678) (73,126) (24,735)\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income, net 33,177 43,735 15,697\nOther income (expense), net 178 (1,042) (898)\nLoss before income taxes (167,323) (30,433) (9,936)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (3,153) (17,550) 1,350\nLoss from continuing operations $ (164,170) $ (12,883) $ (11,286)\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax â (1,374) 2,144,145\nNet (loss) income $ (164,170) $ (14,257) $ 2,132,859\n32\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue decreased 1% for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 driven by decreased revenue in the B Medical Systems segment, partially\noffset by increased revenue in the Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics segments. Gross margin was 40.1% for fiscal year 2024 compared to\n39.6% for fiscal year 2023 driven by margin expansion in the Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics segments, partially offset by margin pressure\nfrom decreased revenue in the B Medical Systems segment. Operating expenses increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily\ndue to the $116.0 million non-cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, increased restructuring and transformation costs recognized in fiscal year\n2024, and a benefit of $18.5 million of fair value contingent consideration adjustments related to the B Medical Systems segment in fiscal year 2023 which\ndid not reoccur; these increases were partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2024. We generated a net\nloss of $164.2 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to a net loss of $14.3 million for fiscal year 2023, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and\nintangible assets, a lower income tax benefit and decreased interest income during fiscal year 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those\nrelated to revenue, business combinations, intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets, inventories, income taxes, and stock-based\ncompensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we deem reasonable under the circumstances. We\nevaluate current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions, both in general and specific to the life sciences industry, that serve as a basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily determinable based on information from other sources. Actual results may\ndiffer from these estimates and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgment and thus have the\nmost significant potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sale of products and services. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 2, Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nDataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10âK.\nAlthough most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple performance obligations or non-\nstandard terms and conditions. For customer contracts that contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction consideration to\neach performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract. We rely on either\nobservable standalone sales or an expected cost-plus margin approach to determine the standalone selling price of offerings, depending on the nature of the\nperformance obligation. Performance obligations whose standalone selling price is estimated using an expected cost-plus margin approach relate to the sale\nof customized automated cold sample management systems and service-type warranties within the Sample Management Solutions segment.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRevenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, primarily automated cold sample management systems, is\nrecognized over time as the asset created by our performance does not have alternative use to us and there is an enforceable right to payment for\nperformance completed to date. We recognize revenue as work progresses based on actual labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated\nlabor hours expected to be incurred. We believe this method most appropriately depicts our efforts towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. We\ndevelop profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated from the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred\nin the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of required product customization and the work required to be able to\ninstall the product in the customerâs existing environment, as well as our historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and\nuncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control. We estimate a loss\non a contract by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognize a loss during the period in which it becomes\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. We review profit estimates for long-term contracts during each reporting period and revise the estimate based on\nchanges in circumstances.\nIf our judgment or estimates in revenue recognition prove incorrect, our revenue in particular periods may be adversely affected and could have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are\nrecorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date.\nSignificant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration, as well as intangibles and\ntheir estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations require estimates of revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs,\nobsolescence factors, discount rates and other assumptions used in computing present value. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in\nallocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as our current and future operating results. Actual results may vary\nfrom these estimates and may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or\nupon a final determination of asset and liability fair value, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair value of assets and liabilities made after the end of\nthe measurement period are recorded within our operating results.\nContingent consideration is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition using an appropriate valuation model, such as the Monte\nCarlo simulation model. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, in which the model runs\nmany simulations based on comparable companiesâ growth rates and their implied volatility. Our estimates of forecasted revenues in the earn-out period\ninclude a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and other relevant factors.\nThese cash flow projections are discounted with a risk-adjusted rate. Each reporting period until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the\nliability is remeasured based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability are subject to significant judgment and given the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results are likely to differ from the\namounts originally recorded and could be materially different.\nIntangible Assets, Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe have identified intangible assets and recorded significant goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. Intangible assets other than goodwill are valued\nbased on estimated future cash flows and amortized over the assets' estimated useful lives. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if\nimpairment indicators are present, at the reporting unit level. Intangible assets other than goodwill and long-lived assets are subject to impairment testing if\nevents and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIn performing a quantitative test for impairment, annually or in the interim period if required based on qualitative factors (as described further in Note\n2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and\nSupplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10âK), we determine fair values of our reporting units based on an income approach in accordance\nwith the discounted cash flow method, or âDCF Methodâ. The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates\ndiscounted to their present value. The key inputs used in the DCF Method include revenue growth rates, forecast gross profit margins, operating expenses\nand capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate, economic and market trends, and discount rate. We derive discount rates that are commensurate with\nthe risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective reporting units and our internally developed projections of future cash flows.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation, including\nmanagementâs best estimate of the reporting unitâs future business activity and the related estimates and assumptions of future cash flows from the assets\nthat include the associated goodwill. Different assumptions for inputs used in the DCF Method could result in different estimates of reporting unit fair value\nas of each testing date.\nIn the event the financial performance of one of our business segments does not meet our expectations in the future, we experience a prolonged macro\nor market downturn, or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions used in our DCF Method analysis, we may be required to perform additional\nimpairment analyses and could be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge.\nWe are required to test long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment when impairment indicators are present. For purposes of this test, long-\nlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of\nother assets and liabilities. If we determine that indicators of potential impairment are present, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived asset group by\ncomparing its undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group exceeds its future cash flows, we\ndetermine fair value of the individual assets within the long-lived asset group to assess potential impairment. If the aggregate fair value of the individual\nassets of the group are less than their carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for an amount in excess of the groupâs aggregate carrying value over\nits fair value. The loss is allocated to the assets within the group based on their relative carrying values, with no asset reduced below its fair value.\nInventory\nWe state our inventory at the lower of cost or market and make adjustments to reduce the inventory cost to its net realizable value through\nestimated reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. The reserves are established for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market\nvalue based on assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. We fully reserve for inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for\ninventory deemed obsolete. We perform periodic reviews of our inventory to identify excess inventory on hand. We compare on-hand inventory balances to\nanticipated inventory usage based on our recent historical activity and forecasted demand for our products developed through our planning systems and\nsales and marketing inputs.\nWe adjust the reserves for excess or obsolete inventory and record additional inventory write-downs based on unfavorable changes in estimated\ncustomer demand or actual market conditions that differ from management's previous projections.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. We operate in numerous\ncountries under many legal forms and, as a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities. We evaluate the\nprofitability of our operations in each jurisdiction on a historic cumulative basis and on a forward-looking basis, while carefully considering carry-forward\nperiods of tax attributes and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. During fiscal year 2024, we recorded\n$5.6 million U.S. federal and state valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, resulting in a total U.S. valuation allowance of $7.7 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. We also maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions totaling $40.2 million as of September\n30, 2024.\n35\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service\nperiod for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our\ncommon stock quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. In addition, for stock-based awards where vesting is dependent upon\nachieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals. Each reporting period we review and revise,\nas needed, estimated achievement of performance goals as part of calculating compensation cost. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements which is incorporated here by\nreference, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,\nItem 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10âK.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPlease refer to the commentary provided below for further discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results from operations for the\ntwelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A comparison of our results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 to the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2022 is included in Part II, Item 7, âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 21, 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied\nupon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management adjusts the GAAP results for the impact of amortization of intangible assets, purchase\naccounting impact on inventory, transformation and rebranding costs, restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, fair value\nadjustments to contingent consideration, governance-related matters, merger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase, and other\nunallocated corporate expenses to provide investors better perspective on the results of operations which the Company believes is more comparable to the\nsimilar analysis provided by its peers.

The Sample Management Solutions segment operating margin was 2.0%, an increase of 386 basis points year over year. The\nincreases in operating income and operating margin were primarily driven by higher revenue, supported by operating leverage and cost reduction\ninitiatives. Adjusted operating income for the Sample Management Solutions segment was $10.8 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to adjusted\noperating loss of $2.3 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted operating margin for the Sample Management Solutions segment was 3.4%, an increase of\n418 basis points year over year. Adjusted operating income (loss) and margin exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets of $4.1 million and\n$3.3 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and transformation costs of $0.4 million for fiscal year 2024.\nOperating loss for the Multiomics segment was $12.2 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to an operating loss of $18.7 million in the prior fiscal\nyear. The Multiomics segment operating margin was (4.8)%, an increase of 274 basis points year over year. The decrease in operating loss and increase in\noperating margin were primarily driven by higher revenue and gross profit, supported by operating leverage. Adjusted operating loss for the Multiomics\nsegment was $8.0 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to adjusted operating loss of $13.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted operating margin for\nthe Multiomics segment was (3.1)%, an increase of 241 basis points year over year.

The B Medical Systems segment operating margin was (31.2)%, a decrease of 1,287 basis points year over year. The increase in operating loss\nand decrease in operating margin were primarily driven by lower revenue and gross profit due to lower volume of cold chain sales in the product mix,\npartially offset by lower operating expenses due to decreased commissions on cold chain sales and cost reduction initiatives. Adjusted operating loss for the\nB Medical Systems segment was $5.7 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to adjusted operating income of $0.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted\noperating margin for the B Medical Systems segment was (6.8)%, a decrease of 763 basis points year over year.

See Note 9, Restructuring, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income, net â We recorded interest income of $33.2 million for fiscal year 2024, a decrease of $10.6 million year over year, driven by\ndecreased investments in marketable securities. See Note 5, Marketable Securities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\nII, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther income (expense), net â We recorded other income of $0.2 million and other expense of $1.0 million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nprimarily due to foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nWe recorded an income tax benefit on continuing operations of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of $17.6 million in\nfiscal year 2023. The decreased tax benefit for the year was primarily driven by the decreased global taxable loss from operations and by $5.6 million of\ncharges related to a valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets. The pretax global loss and global taxable loss are significantly different\nprimarily due to the goodwill impairment charge which is not deductible for tax purposes. During fiscal year 2024, we repatriated approximately $455.0\nmillion in cash from our German subsidiary. We recorded a net tax benefit in the amount of $3.2 million related to the repatriation. The benefit included\n$5.2 million related to deductible U.S. foreign exchange losses on the repatriation measured at the foreign exchange rate on the date of repatriation. This\nbenefit was offset by $2.0 million of state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The tax provision impacts in fiscal year 2024 were offset by the reversal of\nthe related deferred tax asset recorded in fiscal year 2023. Additionally, during fiscal year 2024, we reversed $2.9 million of the deferred tax asset\npreviously established due to changes in foreign exchange rates up to the repatriation date. The impact was recorded against other comprehensive income.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations in fiscal year 2022 consisted of the semiconductor automation business. On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the\nsale of the semiconductor automation business for $2.9 billion in cash.\nThere was no revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2024 or fiscal year 2023. Revenue from discontinued operations was $264.4 million\nfor fiscal year 2022. There was no net income or loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2024. Net loss from discontinued operations was $1.4\nmillion for fiscal year ended 2023 and net income from discontinued operations was $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2022. The net loss from discontinued\noperations in fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by adjustments to liabilities related to discontinued operations of the semiconductor cryogenics\nbusiness, specifically the accrued liability for the litigation with Edwards Vacuum LLC which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year\n2023 and is discussed in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,\nâFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Net income from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2022 is\nprimarily the gain on the sale of the semiconductor business. Income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1)\nare clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by our company on an ongoing basis. Indirect\nexpenses which supported the semiconductor automation business and semiconductor cryogenics business, and which remained as part of the continuing\noperations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.\n42\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2023 has been revised to correct for prior period errors as discussed in\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies â Revisions to Previously Issued Financial Statements and Financial Information to our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included under Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Accordingly,\nthis MD&A reflects the effects of the revisions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $321.0 million, marketable securities of $200.6 million, and\nstockholdersâ equity of $1.8 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $50.3 million and $7.2 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. We incurred a net loss of $164.2 million and $14.3 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net loss for fiscal year 2024 is\nprimarily due to $116.0 million non-cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us\nto fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least one year from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and for the\nforeseeable future thereafter. The current global economic environment makes it difficult for us to predict longer-term liquidity requirements with sufficient\ncertainty. We may be unable to obtain any additional financing that may be required on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to\nus on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressures, or take\nadvantage of acquisition opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nThe discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows is stated on a total company consolidated basis and excludes the impact of discontinued\noperations.\nOur cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 consist of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 310,929 $ 678,910\nRestricted cash 10,061 5,135\nShort-term marketable securities 151,162 338,873\nLong-term marketable securities 49,454 111,338\n$ 521,606 $ 1,134,256\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $146 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash held outside of the United States. If these funds are\nneeded for U.S. operations, we would need to repatriate these funds. Based on current U.S. tax laws, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in\nU.S. federal income tax. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without a material adverse impact.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nOur cash flows for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 50,289 $ 7,158\nNet cash provided by investing activities 224,739 431,384\nNet cash used in financing activities (659,207) (840,459)\nEffects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 21,124 44,666\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (363,055) $ (357,251)\n43\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for\nincome taxes, restructuring activities and other charges impact reported cash flows.\nCash inflows from operating activities for fiscal year 2024 were $50.3 million, primarily due to improved inventory management and decreased\nselling, general and administrative expenses as a result of our cost savings plans and transformation initiatives.\nCash inflows from operating activities for fiscal year 2023 were $7.2 million, primarily resulted from collections on accounts receivable, and efficient\nworking capital management partially offset by payment of retention bonuses and cash settled stock-based awards, as well as state income taxes resulting\nfrom the sale of the semiconductor automation business.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from divestitures, cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchase of\nmarketable securities as well as cash proceeds generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nCash inflows from investing activities were $224.7 million for fiscal year 2024 and consisted of $666.2 million of sales and maturities of marketable\nsecurities, partially offset by $405.6 million for purchases of marketable securities and $38.4 million of capital expenditures.\nCash inflows from investing activities were $431.4 million for fiscal year 2023 and consisted of $1.1 billion of sales and maturities of marketable\nsecurities, partially offset by $236.2 million for purchases of marketable securities and $386.5 million paid for the acquisition of B Medical and Ziath.\nFinancing Activities\nCash outflows for financing activities were $659.2 million and $840.5 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily consisted\nof cash outflows for share repurchases.\nChina Facility\nIn April 2019, we committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of our genomic services business and\nprovide infrastructure to support future growth. The facility is being constructed in two phases. Construction of phase one of the facility was completed in\nfiscal year 2023 with a total cost of $43.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred $3.2 million in costs for the construction of phase two\nwhich we expect to complete in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 with a total cost of $15.4 million.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we have no outstanding debt on our balance sheet.\nDividends\nDividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service\nand capital requirements and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant.\nSince the completion of the sale of the semiconductor automation business on February 1, 2022 we have not paid a quarterly dividend and do not have\nplans to pay any dividends at this time. During fiscal year 2022, prior to the sale, we paid a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend totaling $7.5 million in\nDecember 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn November 4, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the â2022 Repurchase\nAuthorizationâ). As part of the 2022 Repurchase Authorization, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (âASRâ) agreement for the repurchase of\n$500.0 million of our common stock on November 23, 2022. We received delivery of, and retired, 10.1 million shares of common stock under the ASR\nagreement, which terminated on April 3, 2023. In April 2023, other arrangements commenced under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization with the intent of\nrepurchasing the remaining $1.0 billion of shares of our common stock through open market repurchases. As of September 30, 2024 we have repurchased\nand retired 19.9 million shares of common stock for $1.0 billion in open market repurchases. Through the ASR agreement and open market repurchases,\nas of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased and retired 30.0 million shares of common stock for the full $1.5 billion approved under the 2022\nRepurchase Authorization and no authorization is available for additional repurchases.\nSee Note 12, Stockholdersâ Equity in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for additional information about the share repurchase authorization.\nContractual Obligations and Requirements\nAt September 30, 2024, we had non-cancelable commitments of $69.9 million, including purchase orders for inventory of $53.1 million, and\ninformation technology related commitments of $16.8 million.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no obligation, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash\nand short-term and long-term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Exposure\nOur cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consist principally of money market securities which are short-term in nature. At September 30,\n2024 and 2023, our aggregate short-term and long-term investments were $200.6 million and $450.2 million, respectively, and consisted mostly of highly\nrated corporate debt securities, and U.S. government backed securities. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 the net unrealized loss position on marketable\nsecurities was $0.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, which is included in âAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)â in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $6.6 million annual change in interest income earned in fiscal year\n2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding debt on our balance sheet.\nCurrency Rate Exposure\nWe have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Most of these transactions\ncarrying foreign exchange risk are in Germany, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and China. Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were 26% and\n24%, respectively, of our total sales for fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries,\nwhich have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale.\nIn the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between\nour legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately $63.9 million and\n$157.8 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and primarily relate to the Euro, British Pound, and the Chinese yuan. We mitigate the\nimpact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within\n30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency losses of $3.2 million and\n$4.2 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction\noccurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate change of\n$0.4 million in our net income during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024.\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238) 48\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 51\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 52\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 53\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 54\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholdersâ Equity for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 56\n47\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Azenta, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Azenta, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2024 and\n2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in stockholdersâ equity and of cash flows for each\nof the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\").\nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as\nof September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date as the Company did\nnot design and maintain effective controls related to the review of the statement of cash flows.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material\nweakness referred to above is described in Managementâs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered\nthis material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our\nopinion regarding the effectiveness of the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial\nstatements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial\nreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report referred to above. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Companyâs consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinions.\n48\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companyâs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companyâs\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companyâs assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Interim Assessments - B Medical Systems Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companyâs consolidated goodwill balance was $691.4 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and the goodwill associated with the B Medical Systems reporting unit was zero. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more\noften if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unitâs carrying\nvalue exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Changes to the Companyâs operating segments effective\nOctober 1, 2023 resulted in a change to the Companyâs reporting units, which are aligned to the Companyâs operating and reportable segments.\nManagement tested its reporting units for potential impairment immediately before and after the segment realignment and concluded that the estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. The B Medical Systems reportable segment was allocated $109 million of goodwill as\nof October 1, 2023. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company concluded it was more likely than not the fair value of the Companyâs B\nMedical Systems segment was less than its carrying amount and completed a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The results of the Companyâs\nquantitative goodwill impairment analyses as of March 31, 2024 indicated an impairment of all of the goodwill allocated within its B Medical Systems\nreporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was derived using the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method and\nreflect managementâs assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, forecast gross profit margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures, discount rates,\nterminal period growth rates, economic and market trends, and other expectations about the anticipated operating results of its reporting units.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim goodwill impairment assessments of the B\nMedical Systems reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the B\nMedical Systems reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managementâs\nsignificant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, forecast gross profit margins, operating expenses, discount rates, and terminal period growth rates;\nand (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managementâs goodwill impairment\nassessments, including controls over the valuation of the B Medical Systems reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing\nmanagementâs process for developing the fair value estimates of the B Medical Systems reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted\ncash flow method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the discounted cash flow method; and\n(iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, forecast gross profit margins,\noperating expenses, discount rates, and terminal period growth rates. Evaluating managementâs assumptions related to revenue growth rates, forecast gross\nprofit margins, operating expenses, and terminal period growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable\nconsidering (i) the current and past performance of the B Medical Systems reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and\n(iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were\nused to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method and (ii) the reasonableness of the assumptions related to the discount\nrates and terminal period growth rates.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Companyâs auditor since 2016.\n50\nTable of

statements.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAZENTA, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Nature of Operations\nAzenta, Inc. (âAzentaâ, or the âCompanyâ) is a leading global provider of biological and chemical compound sample exploration and management\nsolutions for the life sciences industry. The Company entered the life sciences market in 2011, leveraging its in-house precision automation and cryogenics\ncapabilities that it was then applying in the semiconductor manufacturing market. This led the Company to develop and provide solutions for automated\nultra-cold storage. Since then, the Company has expanded its life sciences offerings through internal investments and through a series of acquisitions. The\nCompany now supports its customers from research and clinical development to commercialization with its sample management, automated storage,\nvaccine cold storage and transport, as well as genomic services expertise to help its customers bring impactful and breakthrough therapies to market faster.\nThe Company understands the importance of sample integrity and offers a broad portfolio of products and services supporting customers at every stage of\nthe life cycle of samples, including procurement, automated storage systems, genomic services and a multitude of sample consumables, informatics and\ndata software, along with sample repository services. The Company's expertise, global footprint, and leadership positions enable it to be a trusted global\npartner to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life sciences research institutions.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor automation business to Thomas H.\nLee Partners, L.P. (âTHLâ). The Company determined that the semiconductor automation business met the âheld for saleâ criteria and the âdiscontinued\noperationsâ criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (âFASBâ) Accounting Standards Codification (âASCâ) 205, Presentation of\nFinancial Statements, (âFASB ASC 205â) as of September 30, 2021. Please refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations for further information about the\ndiscontinued businesses. The Consolidated Financial Statements were restated for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the semiconductor\nautomation business and the semiconductor cryogenics business in accordance with FASB ASC 205. The discussion in the notes to these Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, unless otherwise noted, relate solely to the Company's continuing operations.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor automation business for $2.9 billion in cash.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all entities where it has a controlling financial interest\nand have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (âGAAPâ). All intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevisions to Previously Issued Financial Statements and Financial Information\nIn connection with the preparation of its fiscal year 2024 financial statements, the Company identified classification errors in its Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2023 and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods ended\nMarch 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. Specifically, the Companyâs historical classification of the effects\nof exchange rate changes on the Companyâs foreign denominated cash and cash equivalent balances was misclassified between the effects of exchange rate\nchanges on cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities in its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September\n30, 2023 and its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods ended June 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and\nJune 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company corrected for immaterial classification errors in between cash flows from operating activities, investing activities\nand financing activities, and supplemental disclosures for all revised periods. The Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the\ninterim periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024 have been revised and disclosed in Note\n21, Revision of Previously Issued Unaudited Quarterly Information below.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe Company assessed the effect of the errors on prior periods under the guidance of Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) Staff Accounting\nBulletin No. 99, âMateriality,â codified in ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (âASC 250â). Based on its assessment, the Company\ndetermined that the error correction is not material to any previously issued financial statements. The correction has no impact on the Company's previously\nreported consolidated net income, financial position, net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, or total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted\ncash as previously reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRevisions of Previously Issued Audited Financial Statements\nAs discussed above, the identified errors did not have a material impact on the previously issued financial statements for the year ended September 30,\n2023. The Company has determined it appropriate to revise the following financial statement line items in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for\nthe year ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30, 2023\nAs Reported Adjustments As Revised\nCash flows from operating activities\nAccrued compensation and tax withholdings $ (15,434) $ (3,621) $ (19,055)\nOther current assets and liabilities (26,944) (6,711) (33,655)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 17,490 $ (10,332) $ 7,158\nCash flows from financing activities\nProceeds from issuance of common stock $ - $ 3,621 $ 3,621\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (844,080) $ 3,621 $ (840,459)\nEffects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents $ 37,955 $ 6,711 $ 44,666\nSupplemental disclosures:\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment included in accounts payable and accrued\nexpenses $ - $ 2,725 $ 2,725\nThe Company also added a supplemental disclosure of purchases of property, plant and equipment included in accounts payable and accrued expenses\nin the amount of $10.2 million to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n57\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts\nreported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Although these estimates are based on the Companyâs knowledge of current events and actions it may\nundertake in the future, actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are associated with recording accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill,\nintangible assets other than goodwill, contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations, long-lived assets, derivative financial\ninstruments, deferred income taxes, warranty obligations, revenue over time, stock-based compensation expense, and other accounts. The Company\nassesses the estimates on an ongoing basis and records changes in estimates in the period they occur and become known.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which, assets acquired (including\nidentifiable intangible assets), and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration\npaid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents\nthe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nSignificant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, as well as identified\nintangible assets and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations may be based on valuations that utilize among other factors,\nestimates of revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs, obsolescence factors, future expected cash flows and discount rates attributable to\ncompleted technology and other acquired intangible assets. When estimating the assumptions to be used in the valuation, the Company includes a\nconsideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business, and other relevant factors. These\nassumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made\nafter the end of the measurement period are recorded within our operating results.\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from a change in the underlying inputs are recognized in results of operations until the\narrangement is settled.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Accounting\nAll assets and liabilities of the Companyâs subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated into the reporting currency at period-end\nexchange rates, while revenue, expenses, gains and losses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation\nadjustments are reflected in the âAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)â in the Companyâs Consolidated Balance Sheets and presented as\nâForeign currency translation adjustmentsâ in the Companyâs Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe determination of the functional currency of the Companyâs subsidiaries is based on their financial and operational environment and is the local\ncurrency of the Companyâs foreign subsidiaries. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their\nfunctional currency. Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these transactions are recognized in\nearnings and presented within âOther income (expense)â in the Companyâs Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and\nremeasurement losses totaled $3.2 million, $4.2 million and $1.7 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe semiconductor automation business had foreign operations which had a cumulative translation adjustment balance of $16.6 million at the date of\ndisposal of this business. This amount was removed from âAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)â in the Companyâs Consolidated Balance\nSheet during the three months ended March 31, 2022, and included within the gain on the sale of the semiconductor automation business in âIncome (loss)\nfrom discontinued operations, net of taxâ in the Companyâs Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company has transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Most of these\ntransactions carry foreign exchange risk in Germany, the United Kingdom and China. The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its\nexposure to currency fluctuations. The arrangements typically mature in three months or less and they do not qualify for hedge accounting. Net gains and\nlosses related to foreign exchange contracts are recorded as a component of âOther income (expense)â in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\n58\nTable of Contents\nThe fair values of the forward contracts are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as âPrepaid expenses and other current assetsâ\nand âAccrued expenses and other current liabilitiesâ. Foreign exchange contract assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value based on\nobservable market inputs and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy described below due to a lack of an active market for these contracts.\nAll derivatives, whether designated as a hedging relationship or not, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and the type of\nhedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company must designate the hedging\ninstrument as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation based on the exposure being hedged. Certain\nderivatives held by the Company are not designated as hedges but are used in managing exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nA fair value hedge is a derivative instrument designated for the purpose of hedging the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability\nresulting from a particular risk. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are both recognized in the results of operations and presented in the same caption in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nA cash flow hedge is a derivative instrument designated for the purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from a\nparticular risk. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in\nâAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)â in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item\naffects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations.\nA hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is achieved through a derivative instrument designated for the purpose of hedging the exposure of\nchanges in value of investments in foreign subsidiaries. If the derivative is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective\nportions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in âAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)â as a part of the foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment. Ineffective portions of net investment hedges are recognized in the results of operations.\nFor derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as\ngains or losses consistent with the classification of the underlying risk.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash deposits and cash equivalents, marketable\nsecurities, derivative instruments, and accounts receivable. All of the Companyâs cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities and\nderivative instruments are maintained by major financial institutions.\nThe Company invests cash not used in operations in investment grade, high credit quality securities in accordance with the Companyâs investment\npolicy which provides guidelines and limits regarding investments type, concentration, credit quality and maturity terms aimed at maintaining liquidity and\nreducing risk of capital loss.\nThe Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and believes that it has adequately provided for exposure to potential credit\nlosses. The Companyâs ten largest customers accounted for approximately 26%, 30% and 20% of its consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. One customer accounted for 10% and 13% of the Companyâs consolidated revenue for fiscal\nyears 2024 and 2023, respectively. This customer is related to the B Medical Systems segment and is a distributor shipping to end users in approximately\n40 countries. There were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2022.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company invests in marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Marketable securities reported as current assets represent investments that mature within one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term\nmarketable securities represent investments with maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date.\n59\nTable of Contents\nUnrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of âAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)â in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets until the security is sold or matures. Gains or losses realized from sales of marketable securities are computed based on\nthe specific identification method and recognized as a component of âOther income (expense)â in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nThe Company reviews the marketable securities for impairment at each reporting date to determine if any of the securities have experienced an other-\nthan-temporary decline in fair value. The Company considers factors, such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the\ncost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the Companyâs intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to\nsell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company believes that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, it\nwrites down the investment to its fair value and recognizes the credit loss in earnings and the non-credit loss in âAccumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss)â in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities, including cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, contingent consideration liability, and derivative instruments at fair value. The Company applies a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following levels of inputs may be used\nto measure fair value:\nâ Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible as of the reporting date. Active markets\nare those in which transactions for the asset and liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing\nbasis. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nâ Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and\nquoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially\nthe full term of the assets or liabilities.\nâ Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities and reflect an entityâs own assumptions in pricing\nassets or liabilities since they are supported by little or no market activity.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs, as well as considering counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.\nThe Company measures certain assets, including the cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed\nto be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information\navailable, and may include quoted market prices, market comparable prices, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when\nthe cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to\nknown amounts of cash. Cash equivalents are reported at fair value.\nThe Company classifies long-term restricted cash balances within âOther assetsâ on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets based upon the\nterm of the remaining restrictions.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses\nTrade accounts receivable do not bear interest and are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit\nlosses representing its best estimate of expected credit losses related to its existing accounts receivable and their net realizable value. The Company\ndetermines the allowance based on several factors, including an evaluation of customer credit worthiness, the age of the outstanding receivables, economic\ntrends, historical experience and other information over the payment periods. The Company reviews and adjusts the allowance for expected credit losses on\na quarterly basis. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when the Company determines that the\nbalances are not recoverable. Provisions for expected credit losses are recorded in âSelling, general and administrativeâ expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\n60\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined on a first-in, first-out basis and include the cost of materials, labor and\nmanufacturing overhead. The Company reports inventories at their net realizable value and provides reserves for excess, obsolete or damaged inventory\nbased on changes in customer demand, technology and other economic factors.\nFixed Assets, Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed based on the straight-line method\nand charged to results of operations to allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\nBuildings 10 - 40 years\nComputer equipment and software 3 - 5 years\nMachinery and equipment 2 - 7 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 years\nVehicles 3 - 7 years\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining terms of the respective leases. Equipment used\nfor demonstrations to customers is included in machinery and equipment and depreciated over its estimated useful life. Repair and maintenance costs are\nexpensed as incurred.\nThe Company has developed software for internal use. Internal and external labor costs incurred during the application development stage of a project\nare capitalized. Costs incurred prior to application development and post implementation are expensed as incurred. Training and data conversion costs are\nexpensed as incurred.\nLong lived assets and their associated accumulated depreciation are derecognized upon their retirement or at the time of disposal, and the resulting gain\nor loss is included in the Companyâs results of operations.\nThe Company identified finite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill as a result of acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are valued based on\nestimated future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives based on methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits\nare expected to be realized.\nFinite-lived intangibles assets and fixed assets are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. For purposes of this test, long-\nlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of\nother assets and liabilities. If the Company determines that indicators of potential impairment are present, it assesses the recoverability of long-lived asset\ngroup by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value, and an impairment loss is recognized in operating results to the extent any\nfinite-lived intangible assetâs carrying value exceeds its calculated fair value. The future cash flow period is based on the future service life of the primary\nasset within the long-lived asset group.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, as follows:\nTrademarks 13 years\nPatents 8 years\nCompleted technology 7 - 15 years\nCustomer relationships 10 - 15 years\n61\nTable of Contents\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate and non-real estate and finance leases for non-real estate. The classification of a lease as operating or\nfinance and the determination of the right-of-use asset (âROU assetâ) and lease liability are determined at lease inception. The ROU asset represents the\nCompanyâs right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liability represents the Companyâs obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. As most of the Companyâs leases do not provide an implicit rate, an incremental borrowing rate is used based on the\nestimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. Lease terms may include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\nThe Companyâs lease agreements may contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance\nand utilities. Fixed payments for non-lease components are combined with lease payments and accounted for as a single lease component which increases\nthe amount of the ROU asset and liability.\nThe ROU asset for operating leases is included within âOperating lease right-of-use assetsâ and the ROU asset for finance leases is included within\nâProperty, plant and equipment, netâ in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term lease liabilities for both operating leases and finance leases are\nincluded within âAccrued expenses and other current liabilitiesâ in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The long-term lease liabilities for operating leases and\nfinance leases are included within âLong-term operating lease liabilitiesâ, and âOther long-term liabilitiesâ, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired by the\nCompany. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. The Company elected\nApril 1st as its annual goodwill impairment assessment date. If the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that fair\nvalues of the reporting units are below their carrying values, the Company performs additional impairment tests during interim periods to evaluate goodwill\nfor impairment.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation,\nincluding managementâs best estimate of future business activity and the related estimates of future cash flows from the reporting units that include the\nassociated goodwill. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets\nto their then-current fair market values. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management which\ncould result in impairment charges.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below it, which is\nreferred to as a âcomponentâ. The level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment of whether the operations below an operating\nsegment constitute a self-sustaining business, in which case testing is generally performed at this level.\nThe Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, management performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting\nunitâs fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unitâs carrying value exceeds its fair value,\nup to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWe determine fair values of our reporting units based on an income approach in accordance with the discounted cash flow method, (the âDCF\nMethodâ). The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates discounted to their present values. Terminal value\nrepresents the present value an investor would pay on the valuation date for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the\ndiscrete cash flow projection period. We consider the DCF Method to be the most appropriate valuation technique since it is based on managementâs long-\nterm financial projections. In addition to determining the fair value of our reporting units based on the DCF Method, we also compare the aggregate values\nof our net corporate assets and reporting unit fair values to our overall market capitalization and use certain market-based valuation techniques to assess the\nreasonableness of the reporting unit fair values determined in accordance with the DCF Method.\n62\nTable of Contents\nWarranty Obligations\nThe Company establishes reserves for estimated costs of product warranties based on historical information. Product warranty reserves are recorded at\nthe time product revenue is recognized, and retrofit accruals are recorded at the time retrofit programs are established. The Companyâs warranty obligation\nis affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties\non parts delivered by the Company.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from the following sources:\nâ Products, including sales of automated cold sample management systems, vaccine cold storage and transport systems, consumables, instruments,\nspare parts, and software.\nâ Services, including repairs, upgrades, diagnostic support, installation, as well as biological sample services such as DNA sequencing, gene\nsynthesis, molecular biology, bioinformatics, biological sample storage, sample acquisition, and other support services.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of such promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to\nwhich the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. Under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (âASC\n606â), revenue is recognized when, or as, the transfer of control of the underlying performance obligation occurs. To determine the amount of consideration\nthe Company expects to be entitled to and whether transfer of control has occurred, the Company applies the following five-step model:\nâ Identify the contract with a customer. Contracts are accounted for when approval and commitment has been received from both parties, the rights\nof each party are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration to which\nthe Company is entitled is probable. Contracts are generally evidenced through receipt of an approved purchase order or execution of a binding\narrangement and can be both short and long-term. Long-term contracts within the segments relate to the sale of products with attached service-\ntype warranty contracts that generally have a stated contract term that is greater than one year. Contracts may contain acceptance provisions where\nthe Company is required to obtain technical acceptance from the customer upon completion of installation services and evidence of the systemâs\nfunctional performance within the customerâs operating environment. The Company has concluded that acceptance criteria within its contracts can\nbe objectively evaluated and will not impact the Companyâs transfer of control assessment under ASC 606.\nâ Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include the sale of products and services. Certain customer\narrangements related to the sale of automated cold sample management systems generally include more than one performance obligation and may\ninclude a combination of goods and/or services, such as products with installation services or service-type warranty obligations. These contracts\ninclude multiple promises and as a result, the Company is required to evaluate each promise and determine whether the promise qualifies as a\nperformance obligation within the contract. Contracts may contain the option to acquire additional products or services at defined prices. The\nCompany reviews the pricing of these options to determine whether the option would exist independently of the current contract. If the pricing of\ncontract options provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into the current contract, the Company\naccounts for the option as a separate performance obligation.\nâ Determine the transaction price. The transaction price of the Companyâs contracts with its customer is generally fixed, based on the amounts to be\ncontractually billed to the customer. Although uncommon, certain contracts may contain variable consideration in the form of customer\nallowances and rebates that consist primarily of retrospective volume-based discounts and other incentive programs. Variable consideration is\nestimated at contract inception and included in the transaction price if it is probable that a subsequent change in the estimate would not result in a\nsignificant revenue reversal. The period between transfer of control of the performance obligations within a customer contract and timing of\npayment is generally within one year. As a result, the Companyâs contracts typically do not include significant financing components.\n63\nTable of Contents\nâ Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For customer contracts that contain more than one performance\nobligation, the Company allocates the total transaction consideration to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price\nof each performance obligation within the contract. The Company relies on either observable standalone sales or an expected cost-plus margin\napproach to determine the standalone selling price of offerings, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Performance obligations\nwhose standalone selling price is estimated using an expected cost-plus margin approach relate to the sale of customized automated cold sample\nmanagement systems, services, and service-type warranties.\nâ Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring\na product or service either at a point in time or over time, when the transfer of control of the underlying performance obligation has occurred.\nControl is evidenced by the customerâs ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the performance\nobligation. Revenue from third-party sales for which the Company does not meet the criteria for gross revenue recognition is recognized on a net\nbasis. All other revenue is recognized on a gross basis. The Company excludes from the transaction price all sales taxes assessed by governmental\nauthorities and as a result, revenue is presented net of tax.\nAs a result of applying this five-step model under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenues from its sale of products and services as follows:\nâ Products: Revenue from the sale of standard products is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is considered complete at\neither the time of shipment or arrival at destination, based on the agreed upon terms within the contract. The Companyâs payment terms for the\nsale of standard products are typically 30 to 60 days.\nRevenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, which include primarily automated cold sample management\nsystems is recognized over time as the asset created by the Companyâs performance does not have alternative use to the Company and an\nenforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is present. The Company recognizes revenue as work progresses based on\na percentage of actual labor hours incurred on the project to-date and total estimated labor hours expected to be incurred on the project. The\nselection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. The Company has concluded that using the percentage of\nlabor hours incurred to estimated labor hours needed to complete the project most appropriately depicts the Companyâs efforts towards satisfaction\nof the performance obligation. The Company develops profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated\nfrom the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred in the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of\nrequired product customization and the work required to be able to install the product in the customerâs existing environment, as well as the\nCompanyâs historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation\ndelays or performance issues that may or may not be within the Companyâs control. The Company estimates a loss on a contract by comparing\ntotal estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognizes a loss during the period in which it becomes probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated. The Company reviews profit estimates for long-term contracts during each reporting period and revises the estimate\nbased on changes in circumstances. Revenue for certain arrangements that involve significant product customization but do not provide the\nCompany with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date are recognized at a point in time, upon completion or\nsubstantial completion of the project, provided transfer of control has occurred. The project is considered substantially complete when the\nCompany receives acceptance from the customer and remaining tasks are perfunctory or inconsequential and in control of the Company.\nGenerally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work. In\ncertain instances, payments collected from customers in advance of recognizing the related revenue are recorded and presented as contract\nliabilities within âDeferred revenueâ on the Companyâs Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, due to certain billing constraints within\ncontracts, the customer may retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. In these contracts, an unbilled receivable is\nrecorded when revenue recognized may exceed billings, which the Company presents as a contract asset on the balance sheet, which is included\nwithin the âPrepaid expenses and other current assetsâ on the Companyâs Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n64\nTable of Contents\nâ Services: Service revenue is generally recognized ratably over time or on an output method, as the customer simultaneously receives and\nconsumes the benefit of these services as they are performed. Payments related to service-type warranties may be made up front or proportionally\nover the contract term. Revenue for sample management and storage are recognized over the period the services are rendered or samples are\nstored. Revenue from genomic services is recognized over time and is based upon the fact that transfer of control takes place over time as\ndetermined using the input method of costs incurred. Payment due or received from the customers prior to rendering the associated services are\nrecorded as a contract liability.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company receives government assistance from various domestic and foreign, local, regional and national governments which vary in size and\nduration in the form of cash grants or refundable tax credits. The government assistance typically specifies conditions that must be met in order for it to be\nearned, such as employee retention targets, completion of employee training, or the construction or acquisition of property and equipment and are often\ntime bound. If conditions are not satisfied or if the duration period for the arrangement is not met, the government assistance is often subject to reduction,\nrepayment, or termination.\nThe Companyâs policy is to recognize a benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in âOther, netâ over the life of the asset or duration of the\nprogram when the Company has reasonable assurance that it will comply with the conditions under the government assistance and the government\nassistance will be received, refundable tax credits may also result in a reduction in âAccrued income taxes payableâ in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If\ngovernment assistance is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable by the Company in advance of completion of the conditions, the\ngovernment assistance is recognized in âAccrued expenses and other current liabilitiesâ or âOther long-term liabilitiesâ in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,\nas appropriate.\nIn fiscal year 2024, approximately $2.1 million of government assistance was recognized in âOther, netâ in the Companyâs Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. The Company also received advance cash government assistance of $1.4 million, which was recognized within âOther long-term liabilitiesâ in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet. In fiscal year 2023, approximately $4.3 million of government assistance was recognized in âOther, netâ and\napproximately $0.9 million was recognized as a reduction to âCost of Revenue â Productsâ in the Companyâs Consolidated Statement of Operations. The\nCompany also received advance cash government assistance in fiscal year 2023 of $6.6 million, of which $4.7 million is recognized within âOther long-\nterm liabilitiesâ, and $1.9 million is recognized within âAccrued expenses and other current liabilitiesâ in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of personnel expenses related to\ndevelopment of new products, as well as enhancements and engineering changes to existing products and development of hardware and software\ncomponents.\nRestructuring Charges\nAccounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the Company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the\nCompany has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the Company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a\nprovision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the\ntermination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed\nabove and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models.\nFrom time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the Company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as impairments of\nlong-lived assts that are no longer used in operations (including right-of-use assets, facility-related property and equipment) and termination costs or\npenalties to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period\nfrom when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original\ncontractual period.\n65\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of the Companyâs common stock\nquoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant. For awards that vest based on service conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based\ncompensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that vest subject to performance conditions, the Company\nrecognizes stock-based compensation expense ratably over the performance period if it is probable that performance condition will be met and adjusts for\nthe percentage of shares probable of achieving the performance goals. Each quarter, management assesses the probability of achieving the performance\ngoals. The Company makes estimates of stock award forfeitures and the number of awards expected to vest. The Company considers many factors in\ndeveloping forfeiture estimates, including award types, employee classes and historical experience. Current estimates may differ from actual results and\nfuture changes in estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases, as well as operating\nloss and tax credit carryforwards. The Companyâs Consolidated Financial Statements contain certain deferred tax assets that were recorded as a result of\noperating losses, as well as other temporary differences between financial and tax accounting. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax\nassets if, based upon the evaluation of positive and negative evidence and the extent to which that evidence is objectively verifiable, it is more likely than\nnot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the Companyâs income tax (benefit) expense, the Companyâs deferred tax assets and\nliabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nThe calculation of the Companyâs income tax liabilities involves consideration of uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The\nCompany recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by\ndetermining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon an audit conducted by taxing\nauthorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If the Company determines that a tax position will more likely than not be\nsustained, the second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized\nupon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company must determine the probability of various\npossible outcomes. The Company re-evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors, such as changes in\nfacts or circumstances, tax law, new audit activity and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires\njudgment. A change in recognition or measurement may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax expense.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic income or loss per share is determined by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted income or loss per share is determined by dividing net income or loss by diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\nweighted average shares reflect the dilutive effect, if any, of potential common shares. To the extent their effect is dilutive, employee equity awards and\nother commitments to be settled in common stock are included in the calculation of diluted income or loss per share based on the treasury stock method.\nPotential common shares are excluded from the calculation of dilutive weighted average shares outstanding if their effect would be anti-dilutive at the\nbalance sheet date based on a treasury stock method or due to a net loss.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response\nto the SECâs Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The ASU aligns the requirements in FASBâs ASC with SEC regulations. The effective date\nfor each amendment is the date on which the SEC removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective,\nor if the SEC does not remove the requirement by June 30, 2027, the amendment will not become effective for any entity. Early adoption is prohibited. The\nCompany does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n66\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU\nrequires the disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, primarily through enhanced disclosures pertaining to significant\nsegment expenses. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe standard to determine the impact of adoption on its disclosures. The Company does not expect that the standard will have an impact on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU is intended to\nenhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid\ninformation. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. The Company does not\nexpect the adoption of this standard to impact its consolidated financial statements until fiscal year 2026.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\nfor Investors. Effective fiscal year 2026, the Company is required to disclose climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on\nthe Companyâs business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, the Company will be required to disclose the effects of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions within the notes to the financial statements, subject to certain materiality thresholds. Effective fiscal year 2027,\nrequired disclosures will also include disclosure of material direct greenhouse gas emissions from operations owned or controlled (Scope 1) and material\nindirect greenhouse gas emissions from purchased energy consumed in owned or controlled operations (Scope 2). In April 2024, the SEC issued an order\nvoluntarily staying the effectiveness of the new rules pending the completion of judicial review of certain legal challenges to their validity. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of these rules assuming adoption as well as monitoring the status of the related litigation and the SECâs stay which remains\nin effect as of September 30, 2024.\nIn 2021, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (âOECDâ) introduced its Pillar II Framework Model Rules (âPillar 2â), which\nare designed to impose a 15% global minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Certain aspects of\nPillar 2 took effect on January 1, 2024 while other aspects go into effect on January 1, 2025. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to\nhave a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as the Company does not expect to meet the consolidated revenue threshold of â¬750 million\nover the next twelve months.\n3. Discontinued Operations\nDisposition of the Semiconductor Automation Business\nOn September 20, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners,\nL.P. (âTHLâ) and the Company determined that the semiconductor automation business met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as\na result, its historical financial results are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were\nclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor automation business for $2.9\nbillion in cash. Following the completion of the sale, the Company no longer serves the semiconductor market.\nIn connection with the closing of the sale, the Company and THL entered into a transition services agreement under which both the Company and THL\nprovide each other certain transition services related to finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, compliance, facilities, legal and\nresearch and development support, for time periods which ranged from three to 24 months. In addition, the Company agreed to lease back a portion of the\nfacilities in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, that were sold to THL as part of the sale agreement. As of September 30, 2024, neither party was providing the\nother services under the transition services agreement and the two original leases were terminated. The transition services approximated fair value and\ndid not have a material impact on the Companyâs financial results or operations.\n67\nTable of Contents\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a $1.4 million loss on divestiture. The following table presents the\nfinancial results of automation business discontinued operations with respect to the automation business (in thousands) for the twelve months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022\nRevenue\nProducts $ 244,962\nServices 19,468\nTotal revenue 264,430\nCost of revenue\nProducts 141,165\nServices 11,159\nTotal cost of revenue 152,324\nGross profit 112,106\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 18,486\nSelling, general and administrative 30,622\nRestructuring charges -\nTotal operating expenses 49,108\nOperating income 62,998\nGain on divestiture 2,561,820\nIncome before income taxes 2,624,818\nIncome tax expense 480,673\nNet income from discontinued operations $ 2,144,145\nThe following table presents the significant non-cash items and capital expenditures for the discontinued operations with respect to the semiconductor\nautomation business that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022\nCapital expenditures 2,862\nThere were no significant non-cash items and or capital expenditures related to discontinued operations during the fiscal years ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\n4. Business Combinations\nThe Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the following acquisitions at their fair values as of the acquisition date,\nfrom a market participantâs perspective. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to\nvalue the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, its estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement. Fair value estimates are\nbased on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to\ndetermine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the\nCompanyâs results of operations. The measurement period to finalize the fair values is completed within one year after the respective acquisition date.\n68\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions Completed in Fiscal Year 2023\nZiath Ltd\nOn February 2, 2023, the Company acquired Ziath, Ltd. and its subsidiaries (âZiathâ). Based in Cambridge, United Kingdom, Ziath is a leading\nprovider of 2D barcode readers for life science applications. Founded in 2005, Ziathâs innovative 2D barcode readers are a key component of the laboratory\nautomation workflow serving pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic customers worldwide. Ziath is expected to enhance the Companyâs offerings,\nwhich support the entire lifecycle of sample management from specimen collection to sample registration, storage and processing. The acquisition was\ncompleted at a purchase price of $16.0 million, net of cash acquired. The acquired business is included in the Sample Management Solutions segment.\nThe allocation of the consideration included $12.0 million of goodwill, $4.1 million of technology, $1.1 million of deferred tax liability, $0.6 million of\ncustomer relationships, $0.3 million of trademarks, and several other assets and liabilities. The weighted average life of completed technology is 10 years,\ncustomer relationships is 13 years, and trademarks is 13 years. The goodwill represents the Companyâs ability to provide differentiated technology enabling\nhigh throughput scanning of varied formats of consumables. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company did not present pro forma financial information for its consolidated results of operations for the acquisition because such results are\nimmaterial.\nB Medical Systems S.Ã¡. r.l.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Company acquired B Medical Systems S.Ã¡ r.l. and its subsidiaries (\"B Medical\"), for a purchase price of $432.2 million\nincluding contingent consideration, which the Company estimated to be $17.0 million as of the measurement date. B Medical is a market leader in\ntemperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions that enables the delivery of life-saving treatments to more than 150 countries worldwide. B\nMedicalâs results of operations are reported in the Companyâs Life Sciences Products segment from the date of acquisition. The Company paid a total initial\ncash purchase price at closing of $424.0 million, as adjusted for cash acquired and other items pursuant to the acquisition agreement. B Medical Systems\nHoldings S.A (the âSellerâ) was eligible to earn up to â¬50.0 million in contingent consideration based upon achievement of certain financial metrics by B\nMedical. The Company repaid B Medicalâs outstanding debt of $43.1 million prior to September 30, 2022 which was included in the purchase price and\nwas classified in prepaid assets as of September 30, 2022. In addition, the Company recorded $381.0 million in short-term restricted cash as of September\n30, 2022, which was reserved to complete the acquisition which occurred on October 3, 2022.\nThe contingent consideration payment from the Company to the Seller was based on achievement of certain revenue targets over the one-year period\nfrom October 3, 2022 to September 30, 2023. The Company recorded the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing a Monte\nCarlo simulation that incorporates revenue projections, revenue growth rates of comparable companies, implied volatility and a risk adjusted discount rate.\nEach quarter, the Company was required to remeasure the fair value of this liability as assumptions changed over time and any resulting adjustments in the\nfair value of this liability were recorded in âOperating expensesâ in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This fair value measurement was based on\nsignificant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement. This fair value measurement was directly impacted by the\nCompanyâs estimate of future incremental revenue growth of the business. Accordingly, if actual revenue growth was higher or lower than the estimates\nwithin the fair value measurement, the Company would record additional charges or gains. This liability was revalued from $18.5 million as of December\n31, 2022 to zero as of June 30, 2023.\nThe purchase price was allocated to B Medicalâs tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair\nvalues as of October 3, 2022, as set forth below (in thousands):\n69\nTable of Contents\nFair Value\nAccounts receivable $ 19,549\nInventory 51,978\nOther assets 10,769\nProperty plant and equipment 54,149\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets:\nCompleted technology 100,600\nTrademarks 5,500\nCustomer relationships 36,700\nBacklog 600\nOther liabilities (32,533)\nDeferred income taxes, net (43,393)\nGoodwill 228,241\nTotal purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 432,160\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 the Company recorded adjustments which resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $9.2 million\nsince the initial preliminary purchase price allocation. These adjustments include a $1.0 million decrease to property, plant and equipment, a $0.4 million\nincrease to intangible assets, a $9.6 million decrease to other assets, a $2.3 million increase to inventory, a $0.8 million decrease in other liabilities, and a\n$0.4 million decrease to deferred taxes. The Company finalized purchase accounting for B Medical in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and there have\nbeen no adjustments to the purchase price allocation.\nIn performing the purchase price allocation, the Company considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, and historical\nfinancial performance and estimates of future performance of B Medicalâs business. As part of the purchase price allocations, the Company determined the\nidentifiable intangible assets were completed technology value, trademarks, customer relationships and backlog. The fair value of the intangible assets was\nestimated using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, and the cash flow projections were discounted using a rate\nof 13%. The cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction, and the discount rate applied was benchmarked to the implied rate of return\nfrom the transaction and the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average life of completed technology is 10 years, customer relationships is 16\nyears, trademarks is five years and backlog is one year. The intangible assets acquired are amortized over their respective weighted average life using\nmethods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. The calculation of the excess of the purchase price over\nthe estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. Goodwill of $228.2 million largely reflected the\nthen potential expansion of the Company's cold chain capabilities by adding differentiated solutions for reliable and traceable transport of temperature-\ncontrolled specimens. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe acquired intangible assets and goodwill are subject to review for impairment if indicators of impairment develop and otherwise at least annually.\nSee Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets below for information about the impairment of this goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nThe following financial information reflects the Company's consolidated results from B Medical (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenue $ 83,125 $ 113,122\nNet loss $ (142,637) $ (26,463)\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe results of the Companyâs quantitative goodwill impairment analyses as of March 31, 2024 indicated an impairment of goodwill within its B\nMedical Systems reporting unit resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $111.3 million recorded within \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\"\nin the Companyâs Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal year 2024.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company conducts an impairment assessment annually on April 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Changes to the\nCompanyâs operating segments effective October 1, 2023 resulted in a change to the Companyâs reporting units, which are aligned to the Companyâs\noperating and reportable segments (as further described in Note 18, Segment and Geographic Information below). As a result of this segment realignment,\nthe Company allocated goodwill to the reporting units existing under the new organizational structure on a relative fair value basis as of October 1, 2023.\nThe Company estimated the fair values of the affected businesses based upon the present value of their anticipated future cash flows. The Company's\ndetermination of fair value involved judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nThe Company tested its reporting units for potential impairment immediately before and after the segment realignment and concluded that the\nestimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. As of October 1, 2023, the fair value of the B Medical Systems reporting\nunit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 percent.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, as part of the Companyâs routine long-term planning process, the Company assessed several events and\ncircumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including updates to forecasted cash flows, the\nimpact of the Companyâs planned transformation initiatives and the overall change in the economic climate since its last impairment assessment in October\n2023. The Company concluded it was more likely than not the fair value of the Companyâs B Medical Systems segment was less than its carrying amount\nresulting from the reduction in the Companyâs anticipated revenue growth rates for the current and subsequent years as compared to prior projections. As a\nresult, the Company completed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles â Goodwill as of\nMarch 31, 2024.\nFor the quantitative goodwill impairment analyses performed, the Company compared the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units to their\nrespective carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of each of the reporting units were derived using the income approach, specifically the DCF method.\nThe discounted cash flow models used in the DCF Method analysis reflected the Companyâs assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, forecast gross\nprofit margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures, discount rates, terminal period growth rates, economic and market trends, and other expectations\nabout the anticipated operating results of its reporting units. As part of the goodwill impairment test, the Company also considered its market capitalization\nand guideline public companies in assessing the reasonableness of the combined fair values estimated for its reporting units. Goodwill impairment is\nmeasured as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill for that reporting\nunit.\nThe results of the Companyâs quantitative goodwill impairment analyses as of March 31, 2024 indicated an impairment of goodwill within its B\nMedical Systems reporting unit resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $111.3 million recorded within \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible\nassets\" in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company concluded that there was no\nimpairment to goodwill for the Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics reporting units as of March 31, 2024 or the annual impairment testing date\nof April 1, 2024.\nIn the event the financial performance of any of the reporting units does not meet managementâs expectations in the future, the Company experiences a\nprolonged macroeconomic downturn, or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions used in the DCF method used to value the reporting units, the\nCompany may be required to perform additional impairment analyses with respect to such reporting units and could be required to recognize additional\nimpairment charges.\n75\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment that is consistent with the Company's operating\nsegments effective October 1, 2023 (in thousands):\nSample\nLife Sciences Life Sciences Management B Medical\nProducts Services Solutions Multiomics Systems Total\nBalance - September 30, 2022 $ 154,612 $ 359,011 $ â $ â $ â $ 513,623\nAcquisitions 242,789 â â â 242,789\nCurrency translation adjustments 27,903 24 â â â 27,927\nBalance - September 30, 2023 $ 425,304 $ 359,035 $ â $ â $ â $ 784,339\nSegment recast (1) (425,304) (359,035) 478,601 196,760 108,978 â\nImpairment â â â â (111,317) (111,317)\nCurrency translation adjustments â â 16,048 â 2,339 18,387\nBalance - September 30, 2024 $ â $ â $ 494,649 $ 196,760 $ â $ 691,409\nAccumulated goodwill impairments,\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ (111,317) $ (111,317)\n(1) Changes to the Companyâs operating segments effective October 1, 2023 resulted in a change to the Companyâs reporting units.

As of September 30, 2024, the future unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units expected to vest is\n$19.1 million and is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 1.5 years.\nThe following table reflects restricted stock units and stock awards granted during fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nTime-based restricted stock units 282,268 311,609 120,066\nCommon stock awards â â 18,471\nPerformance-based restricted stock units 383,625 278,457 111,148\nTotal units 665,893 590,066 249,685\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants\nRestricted stock units granted with a required service period typically have three-year vesting schedules in which one-third of awards vest at each\nannual anniversary of grant date, subject to the award holders meeting service requirements.\nCertain members of the Board of Directors have elected to defer receiving their annual stock awards and related quarterly dividends, if any, until they\nattain a certain age or cease to provide services as a member of the Companyâs Board of Directors. Annual deferred stock awards granted during fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023, and 2022 vested upon issuance.\n85\nTable of Contents\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants\nPerformance-based restricted stock units are earned based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Human Resources and\nCompensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The criteria for performance-based awards are weighted and have threshold, target and\nmaximum performance goals. Performance-based restricted stock units may also have a required service period following the achievement of all or a\nportion of the performance goals.\nPerformance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022 allow participants to earn 100% of restricted stock units if\nthe Companyâs performance meets or exceeds its target goal for each applicable financial metric, and up to a maximum of 200% if the Companyâs\nperformance for such metrics meets or exceeds the maximum or stretch goal. Performance below the minimum threshold for each financial metric results in\naward forfeiture. Performance goals are measured over a three-year period for each yearâs restricted stock unit awards and at the end of the period to\ndetermine the number of restricted stock units earned, if any, by recipients who continue to meet the service requirement. Upon the third anniversary of\neach yearâs restricted stock unit awardsâ grant date, the Companyâs Board of Directors determines the number of restricted stock units earned for\nparticipants who continue to meet the service requirements on the vest date.\nIn October 2023, the Companyâs Board of Directors approved an amendment to the performance goals associated with the previously issued\nperformance-based restricted stock units for all impacted employees, excluding members of the Companyâs executive team. The performance goals, as\namended, are more reflective of the current macroeconomic environment and consideration toward employee retention in the competitive life sciences\nindustry. Before the amendment, the original performance goals were not expected to be satisfied. Subsequent to the amendment, vesting became probable\nbased on the forecasted achievement of the amended performance goals. The amendment of these restricted stock units is treated as a modification with the\ntotal potential maximum compensation cost of $4.1 million recognized over the service period through November 2025. The Company recorded expense\nof $1.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 related to the modified awards.\nAwards Granted to the Board of Directors\nThe stock-based compensation granted to members of the Companyâs Board of Directors includes common stock awards, restricted stock unit awards\nand deferred common stock and restricted stock unit awards.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows its employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the\nfair market value of the Companyâs stock at the beginning or the end of the semi-annual offering period, whichever is lower. On February 8, 2017, the\nstockholders approved the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the â2017 Planâ). The 2017 Plan allows for purchases by employees of up\nto 1,250,000 shares of the Companyâs common stock. As of September 30, 2024, 513,634 shares of common stock remain available for purchase under the\n2017 Plan. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued 72,787 shares, 83,715 shares, and 82,035 shares\nrespectively, under the 2017 Plan.\nValuation Assumptions for an Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nRisk-free interest rate 5.3% 5.2% 1.7%\nVolatility 47% 57% 49%\nExpected life 6 months 6 months 6 months\nDividend yield â% â% â%\nThe risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for notes with terms approximating the expected life of the shares granted. The expected\nstock price volatility is determined based on the Companyâs historic stock prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the shares granted.\nThe expected life represents the weighted average period over which the shares are expected to be purchased. Dividend yields are projected based on the\nCompanyâs history of dividend declarations and managementâs intention for future dividend declarations.\n86\nTable of Contents\n15. Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables summarize assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTotal Fair\nDescription Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 157,990 $ 157,990 $ â $ â\nAvailable-for-sale securities 198,616 37,584 161,032 â\nConvertible debt securities 2,000 â â 2,000\nForeign exchange contracts 9 â 9 â\nTotal assets $ 358,615 $ 195,574 $ 161,041 $ 2,000\nLiabilities:\nNet investment hedge 1,915 â 1,915 â\nForeign exchange contracts 213 â 213 â\nTotal liabilities $ 2,128 $ â $ 2,128 $ â\nAs of September 30, 2023\nTotal Fair\nDescription Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 525,952 $ 525,952 $ â $ â\nAvailable-for-sale securities 450,211 85,949 364,262 â\nForeign exchange contracts 44 â 44 â\nNet investment hedge 13,036 â 13,036 â\nTotal assets $ 989,243 $ 611,901 $ 377,342 $ â\nLiabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts 421 â 421 â\nTotal liabilities $ 421 $ â $ 421 $ â\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of money market funds and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted\nmarket prices in active markets. The Company considers all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of\npurchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.\n87\nTable of Contents\nAvailable-For-Sale Securities\nAvailable-for-sale securities primarily consist of highly rated corporate debt securities and U.S. government backed securities which are classified as\nLevel 1. Investments classified as Level 2 consist of debt securities that are valued using matrix pricing and benchmarking because they are not actively\ntraded, and bank certificates of deposit. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securitiesâ relationship to\nother benchmark quoted prices.\nConvertible Debt Securities\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company purchased $2.0 million principal amount of convertible notes issued by a private company. The\nconvertible notes are loans to convert to an equity stake in the private company upon a predetermined conversion event. The Company has elected the fair\nvalue option in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments (âASC 825â) to record the convertible notes. The fair value option under ASC 825 allows\nan entity to account for the entire financial instrument at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings through the consolidated\nstatements of operations at each reporting date. The Company elected the fair value option methodology to account for the convertible notes because the\nCompany believes it accurately reflects the value of the securities and embedded features in the financial instrument. As of September 30, 2024, the fair\nvalue of the convertible notes was $2.0 million and is included in âShort-term marketable securitiesâ on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value\ndetermination is based on unobservable inputs (Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy) which were based on the best information available in the circumstance,\nincluding transaction pricing, recent acquisition, and market participant assumptions. The unobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of\nassets classified as Level 3 have an inherent measurement uncertainty that if changed could result in higher or lower fair value measurements of the assets\nas of the reporting date.\nForeign Exchange Contracts & Net Investment Hedge\nOur foreign exchange contract assets and liabilities, and our net investment hedge assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value using\nthe market method valuation technique. The inputs to this technique utilize current foreign currency exchange forward market rates published by third-\nparty leading financial news and data providers. These are observable data that represent the rates that the financial institution uses for contracts entered\ninto at that date; however, they are not based on actual transactions, so they are classified as Level 2.\n88\nTable of Contents\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, impairment indicators may subject goodwill and long-lived\nassets to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis. As described in Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, as of September 30, 2024, the Company\nestimated the fair value of its reporting units using the DCF Method. Because the inputs to the valuation method are largely unobservable and reflect the\nCompanyâs own assumptions, goodwill and long-lived assets are classified as Level 3.\nContingent Consideration Liability\nThe contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of B Medical was measured and reported at fair value using the real options method\nbased on the unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value and classified with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The contingency was based\non the acquired businessâ performance through September 30, 2023. Please refer to Note 4, Business Combinations for further details. This liability was\nrevalued from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to zero as of June 30, 2023, with the offset to the changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n16.

The Company recorded a net\ntax benefit in the amount of $3.2 million related to the repatriation. The benefit included $5.2 million related to deductible U.S. foreign exchange losses\nmeasured at the foreign exchange rate on the date of repatriation. This benefit was offset by $2.0 million of state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The\ntax provision impacts in fiscal year 2024 were offset by the reversal of the related deferred tax asset recorded in fiscal year 2023. Additionally, during fiscal\nyear 2024, the Company reversed $2.9 million of the deferred tax asset previously established due to changes in foreign exchange rates up to the\nrepatriation date. The impact was recorded against other comprehensive income.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the B Medical Systems segment. This impairment charge is\nnot deductible for tax purposes. For tax purposes the Company has estimated that Azenta Luxembourg, the owner of B Medical Systems, would have a\ndeductible impairment of its investment in the business, which is a significant component of the $22.6 million rate reconciliation benefit for âImpact of\ninvestments in subsidiariesâ above. This tax deduction puts Luxembourg into a valuation allowance position as it does not have sufficient taxable income to\nutilize the loss, therefore driving a significant increase in the valuation allowance.\nThe Company has not provided deferred income taxes on the outside basis differences of any other foreign subsidiary and maintains its general\nassertion of indefinite reinvestment regarding those subsidiaries and the remaining earnings of its German subsidiary as of September 30, 2024. The\nremaining foreign earnings total approximately $899.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and are expected to be reinvested in foreign operations and\nacquisitions. The Company did not calculate estimated deferred tax liabilities on the remaining earnings because such calculations would not be practicable\ndue to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation. The taxes on these earnings would primarily consist of foreign withholding taxes, taxes on foreign\nexchange gains and losses resulting from potential future distributions, and U.S. state income taxes. Substantially all of the unremitted earnings of the\nCompany have been taxed in the U.S. based on the international tax regulations.\n90\nTable of Contents\nThe significant components of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible $ 10,314 $ 10,426\nFederal, state and foreign tax credits 1,151 157\nOther assets 1,048 613\nEquity compensation 2,359 2,183\nNet operating loss carryforwards 49,687 9,692\nLease liabilities 16,774 17,513\nCapitalized research and development 8,050 6,807\nDeferred revenue 3,573 3,672\nOutside basis differences in subsidiaries â 6,058\nDeferred tax assets 92,956 57,121\nDepreciation and intangible amortization (82,732) (97,572)\nRight-of-use assets (15,662) (16,632)\nOther liabilities (605) (317)\nNet unrealized gain on hedging and investments â (1,574)\nDeferred tax liabilities (98,999) (116,095)\nValuation allowance (47,865) (8,348)\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $ (53,908) $ (67,322)\nThe deferred tax assets on the balance sheets for September 30, 2024 and 2023 also include $0.6 million and $0.6 million deferred tax charges related\nto the companyâs intercompany profit elimination, respectively.\nASC Topic 740 requires that all available evidence, both positive and negative, be considered in determining, based on the weight of that evidence,\nwhether a valuation allowance is needed. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the\nextent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult\nit is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or the entire deferred tax asset.\nThe Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The Company\noperates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities. The\nCompany evaluates the profitability of its operations in each jurisdiction on a historic cumulative basis and on a forward-looking basis, while carefully\nconsidering carry-forward periods of tax attributes and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.\nThe Company has generated U.S. pre-tax losses in recent years but has been in an overall U.S. deferred tax liability position. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company is in a net U.S. deferred tax asset position and considered whether the future taxable temporary differences are sufficient to offset future\ndeductible temporary differences. As a result, an additional valuation allowance was recorded against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets during fiscal\nyear 2024. After evaluating all the relevant positive and negative evidence, the Company has recorded a $5.6 million valuation allowance against deferred\ntax assets in the United States during the year. The Company also maintains valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign\njurisdictions totaling $40.2 million as of September 30, 2024. A full valuation allowance was recorded in the Company's Luxembourg subsidiary related to\nthe B Medical business during fiscal year 2024 in the amount of $29.5 million.\n91\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has tax-effected federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $5.8 million,\n$1.6 million and $42.2 million, respectively. The federal net operating losses carry forward indefinitely with the deductions limited to eighty percent of\ntaxable income in any given year. The state net operating loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2026. Many of the foreign net operating loss carry-\nforwards have no limit in number of years, but some have deductions capped at a certain percent of taxable income.\nThe Company has performed studies to determine if there are any annual limitations on the federal net operating losses under Section 382 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of these studies, the Company has determined that ownership\nchanges have occurred primarily in connection with acquisitions when the Company has issued stock to the sellers, as well as ownership changes in the\nsubsidiaries acquired by the Company. The benefits of the net operating losses that will expire before utilization have not been recorded as deferred tax\nassets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities involve judgment and estimation, and they are monitored based on\nthe best information available. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the consolidated liability for unrecognized income tax benefits\nduring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 298 $ 1,679 $ 2,006\nReductions from lapses in statutes of limitation â (1,381) (327)\nBalance at end of period $ 298 $ 298 $ 1,679\nAll of the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company\nrecognizes interest related to unrecognized benefits as a component of the income tax (benefit) expense which was not material for the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes in various jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to\nthe Companyâs interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it files.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to income tax audits in various global jurisdictions in which it operates. The years subject to\nexamination vary for the United States and international jurisdictions, with the earliest tax year being 2019. Based on the outcome of these examinations or\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits could change from those\nrecorded in the Companyâs Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently anticipates that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax\nbenefits and accrued interest on those benefits will be reduced by $0.3 million in the next 12 months due to statute of limitations expirations. The\nunrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.\n92\nTable of Contents\n17.

Segment and Geographic Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information is available\nand regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (âCODMâ) in deciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance. The Companyâs\nChief Executive Officer is the Companyâs CODM.\nEffective October 1, 2023, the Company realigned its organizational structure to three principal business segments to enhance its commercial strategy\nfor accelerating growth and to enable additional profitability initiatives. These segments align with changes in how the Companyâs CODM manages the\nbusiness, allocates resources, and assesses performance. The Companyâs operating and reportable segments consist of the following:\nâ Sample Management Solutions. The SMS business resources operate as a single business unit offering end-to-end sample management\nproducts and services, including: Sample Repository Services and Core Products (Automated Stores, Cryogenic Systems, Automated Sample\nTube, Consumables and Instruments and Controlled Rate Thawing Devices).\nâ Multiomics. The Multiomics business resources operate as a single business unit offering genomic and other sample analysis services,\nincluding gene sequencing, synthesis editing and related services.\nâ B Medical Systems. The B Medical Systems business resources operate as a single business unit focused on the manufacturing and\ndistribution of temperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions in international markets to governments, health institutions, and non-\ngovernment organizations.\n93\nTable of Contents\nThe segment realignment had no impact on the Companyâs consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. All segment\ninformation is reflective of this new structure, and prior period information has been recast to conform to our current period presentation.\nManagement considers adjusted operating income (loss), which excludes charges related to amortization of intangible assets, purchase accounting\nimpact on inventory, transformation and rebranding costs, restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, fair value adjustments to\ncontingent consideration, merger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase, governance-related matters, and other unallocated corporate\nexpenses, as the primary performance metric when evaluating each segmentâs operations.\nThe following is the summary of the financial information for the Companyâs reportable segments for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023\nand 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenue:\nSample Management Solutions $ 318,646 $ 303,654 $ 304,561\nMultiomics 254,552 248,296 250,937\nB Medical Systems 83,125 113,122 -\nTotal revenue $ 656,323 $ 665,072 $ 555,498\nAdjusted operating income (loss):\nSample Management Solutions $ 10,841 $ (2,349) $ 23,970\nMultiomics (7,995) (13,779) 5,032\nB Medical Systems (5,669) 919 â\nSegment adjusted operating income (loss) (2,823) (15,209) 29,002\nAmortization of completed technology 24,770 18,494 7,324\nPurchase accounting impact on inventory â 9,664 â\nAmortization of intangible assets other than completed technology 26,500 29,884 24,965\nTransformation(1) and rebranding costs 13,856 (49) 2,741\nRestructuring charges 11,808 4,577 712\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets 115,975 â â\nContingent consideration - fair value adjustments â (18,549) 600\nMerger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase(2) 4,874 13,842 17,329\nOther unallocated corporate expenses 72 54 66\nTotal operating loss (200,678) (73,126) (24,735)\nInterest income, net 33,177 43,735 15,697\nOther income (expense), net 178 (1,042) (898)\nLoss before income taxes $ (167,323) $ (30,433) $ (9,936)\n(1) Transformation costs represent non-recurring expenses for strategic projects with anticipated long-term benefits to the Company focused on cost reduction and productivity improvement\nthat do not meet the definition of restructuring charges. These costs are directed at simplifying, standardizing, streamlining, and optimizing the Companyâs operations, processes and systems\nto permanently alter the Companyâs operations for the long term. For a project to be considered transformational, successful completion of the project must be expected to bring long-term\nmaterial benefits to the organization and involve significant changes to process and/or underlying technology. Transformation costs in the period result from actions taken as part of the\nCompanyâs 2024 cost reduction plan, and primarily relate to one time asset write downs associated with changes in technology, one time inventory write downs relating to restructuring\nactions taken in the period, and third-party consulting costs associated with process and systems re-design.\n(2) Includes expenses related to governance-related matters.\nThe Company has corrected the segment adjusted operating income (loss) for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 as certain corporate\nexpenses that are not part of the Companyâs CODMâs review of operating segment performance were improperly included in the previously disclosed\nsegment operating income (loss) performance measure. As a result, the presentation of amounts previously disclosed for segment operating income (loss)\nwere updated to reflect segment adjusted operating income (loss) after having been adjusted to remove these corporate expenses. These adjustments\nreduced total segment adjusted operating loss for fiscal year 2023 by $29.8 million and increased total segment adjusted operating income for fiscal year\n2022 by $7.2 million. The total net loss before income taxes remained unchanged.\n94\nTable of Contents\nThe following is the summary of the asset information for the Company's reportable segments as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAssets: 2024 2023\nSample Management Solutions $ 859,353 $ 675,708\nMultiomics 462,825 534,437\nB Medical Systems 231,601 511,640\nTotal assets $ 1,553,779 $ 1,721,785\nThe following is a reconciliation of the segment assets to the corresponding amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30,\n2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nSegment assets $ 1,553,779 $ 1,721,785\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities 521,606 1,134,256\nDeferred tax assets 837 571\nOther assets 23,819 29,108\nTotal assets $ 2,100,041 $ 2,885,720\nRevenue from external customers is attributed to geographic areas based on locations in which the product is shipped.

There were no\ncustomers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2022. As of September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 there\nwere no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Companyâs accounts receivable balance.\n95\nTable of Contents\n19. Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot\npredict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or, in certain instances, provide reasonable ranges of potential losses.\nThe Company may also have certain indemnification obligations pursuant to claims made under the definitive agreement it entered into with Edwards\nVacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) in connection with the Companyâs sale of its semiconductor cryogenics business in the fourth quarter\nof fiscal year 2018. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, Edwards asserted claims for indemnification under the definitive agreement relating to alleged\nbreaches of representations and warranties relating to customer warranty claims and inventory (the â2020 Claimâ). In addition, in January 2023, Edwards\nfiled a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York seeking indemnification from the Company\nunder such definitive agreement for $1.0 million and other related damages, including interest and attorneyâs fees, arising from a third-party claim that was\nincluded as part of their initial claims (the â2023 Claimâ).\nIn April 2023, the Company responded to and filed a counterclaim against Edwards for the 2023 Claim alleging breach of the definitive agreements by\nEdwards and seeking a declaratory judgment. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company and Edwards entered into a settlement agreement\nrelated to the 2023 Claim to avoid the costs and uncertainties of potential litigation. Under the settlement agreement, the Company paid Edwards\n$0.8 million from one of the indemnification escrows established at closing of the sale in return for the release of the 2023 Claim and the release to the\nCompany of any residual funds in this escrow.\nThe Company accrued a liability of $2.5 million for the 2020 Claim and 2023 Claim of which $0.8 million was paid during the third quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023. The 2020 Claim remains outstanding and $1.7 million remains in the balance of the accrued liability as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company cannot determine the probability of any losses or outcome of the 2020 Claim including the amount of any indemnifiable losses, if any,\nresulting from these claims. However, the Company does not believe that this claim will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position\nor results of operations. If the resolution of the 2020 Claim results in indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable indemnification deductibles\nestablished under the definitive agreement, Edwards would be required to seek recovery under the representation and warranty insurance Edwards obtained\nin connection with the closing of the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business. Management believes that any indemnifiable losses in excess of the\napplicable deductibles established in the definitive agreement would be covered by such insurance. For indemnifiable claims other than those arising from\nbreaches of representations and warranties and for indemnifiable claims arising from breaches of representations and warranties exceeding the maximum\ncoverage of the representations and warranties insurance policy, Edwards could seek recovery of such indemnifiable losses, if any, directly from the\nCompany. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, there can be no assurance that the\nCompanyâs assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome, and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material\nadverse effect on the Companyâs consolidated financial position or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nTariff Matter\nWith the assistance of a third-party consultant, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company initiated a review of the value of transactions it\nused for intercompany imports into the U. S. from its GENEWIZ business. As a result of this review and a new interpretation surrounding the valuation\nmethod used to calculate the estimated transaction value, the Company revised its estimate of the tariffs owed and paid $5.9 million to the U.S. customs\nauthorities in fiscal year 2022 related to transactions prior to December 2021. In July 2024, the Company paid approximately $2.5 million in tariffs as well\nas interest related to the imports from its GENEWIZ business into the U.S. during the period of December 2021 to July 2024. As of the date of issuance of\nthe financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company does not anticipate any penalties associated with this payment as its\nvaluation methodology was accepted by U.S. customs authorities during previous voluntary disclosures. U.S. custom authorities, however, have six months\nto review the Companyâs disclosures and the amount of the payment.\nPurchase Commitments\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had non-cancellable commitments of $69.9 million, comprised of purchase orders for inventory of $53.1 million,\nand information technology related commitments of $16.8 million.\n96\nTable of Contents\n20. Subsequent Events\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company announced it is pursuing a sale of its B Medical Systems segment. The Company has concluded that, as of\nNovember 12, 2024, B Medical Systems is a discontinued operation and will be classified as held for sale in future filings.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Financial Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECâs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere not effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K due to the material weakness described\nbelow.\nManagementâs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial\nreporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of our chief executive and\nchief financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited Sates, or GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\nâ pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our assets;\nâ provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,\nand that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and\nâ provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have\na material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an\nassessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the\nmaterial weakness described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of a companyâs annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as we did not design and maintain effective controls related to the\nreview of the cash flow statement. The material weakness resulted in immaterial misstatements in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Q2\nand Q3 interim periods during fiscal 2023, for the year ended September 30, 2023, as well as the Q1, Q2, and Q3 interim periods during fiscal 2024 and in\nour supplemental cash flow disclosures for the year ended September 30, 2022, each interim and annual period during fiscal 2023 and the Q1, Q2 and Q3\ninterim periods during fiscal 2024. Additionally, the material weakness could result in material misstatements of our interim or annual consolidated\nstatement of cash flows or supplemental cash flow disclosures that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n100\nTable of Contents\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8, âFinancial Statements and Supplementary Dataâ of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation Plan\nOur management has taken, and plans to take, actions to remediate the deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting and will implement\nnew processes, procedures and controls designed to address the underlying causes associated with the material weakness.\nWe are in the process of:\ni. implementing a new cash flow reporting tool which will automate the calculation of the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash\nequivalents, and\nii. implementing and documenting new processes and controls over the review of our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWe believe the measures described above will remediate the material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. The\nmaterial weakness will not be considered remediated until we have completed the design and implementation of the applicable controls and they operate for\na sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. We are committed to continuing to\nimprove our internal control over financial reporting, and as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we\nmay take additional measures beyond those remediation measures described above to address control deficiencies, or we may modify certain of the\nremediation measures described above.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the\nfiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director nor officer of the Company adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except:\nOn September 9, 2024, Jason W. Joseph, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for the\nperiod commencing three months from such date and ending on December 31, 2025 for the sale of up to 21,000 shares of common stock of the Company.\nDeparture of Named Executive Officer\nOn July 16, 2024, Robin Vacha, the Companyâs Senior Vice President, Global Operations, submitted his resignation effective August 16, 2024, and on\nsuch effective date, Mr. Vacha ceased to be employed by the Company.\nItem 9C.

(referred to herein as âweâ, âourâ, âusâ or âthe Companyâ) has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended: our common stock.\nThe following description of our capital stock summarizes the material terms of our capital stock. It may not contain all the information that is\nimportant to you. For the complete terms of our capital stock, please refer to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (ârestated certificate of\nincorporationâ), and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (âamended and restated bylawsâ) which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.02 is a part, which may be further amended and/or restated from time to time. The Delaware General\nCorporation Law may also affect the terms of these securities.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nUnder our restated certificate of incorporation our authorized capital stock consists of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per\nshare, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which 126,500 shares have been designated Series A Junior Participating\nPreferred Stock. We designated the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan that has expired.\nCommon Stock\nVoting\nThe holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Our\ncommon stock does not have cumulative voting rights.\nDividends\nIf our board of directors declares a dividend, holders of our common stock will receive payments from our funds that are legally available to pay\ndividends.\nLiquidation and Dissolution\nIf we are liquidated, dissolved or our affairs are wound up, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all the assets that\nremain after payment of our liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding preferred stock.\nOther Rights and Restrictions\nHolders of our common stock have no preemptive or other subscription or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions\napplicable to our common stock. The outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.\nListing\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol âAZTA.â\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare, Inc.\n1\nPreferred Stock\nUnder our restated certificate of incorporation, we have authority, subject to any limitations prescribed by law and without further stockholder\napproval, to issue from time to time up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, in one or more classes or series. Our board of\ndirectors, without further approval of the stockholders, is authorized to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights\nand terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each class or series of the preferred stock. The\nissuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could, among other things,\nadversely affect the voting power or rights of the holders of our common stock and, under certain circumstances, make it more difficult for a third party to\ngain control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock. Of the\n1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 126,500 shares have been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. We designated the Series A Junior\nParticipating Preferred Stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan that has expired.\nCertain Effects of Authorized but Unissued Stock\nWe have shares of common stock and preferred stock available for future issuance without stockholder approval. We may issue these additional\nshares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, facilitating corporate acquisitions, for paying a\ndividend on our capital stock or in connection with the adoption of a stockholder rights plan. The existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and\npreferred stock may enable our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could\nrender more difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, thereby\nprotecting the continuity of our management. In addition, if we issue preferred stock, the issuance could adversely affect the voting power of holders of\ncommon stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation.\nDelaware Law and Certificate of Incorporation and By-law Provisions\nStockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders; Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that:\nâ stockholder action may be taken only at a duly called and convened annual or special meeting of stockholders;\nâ stockholder action may not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\nâ special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our chief executive officer, president or by our board of directors and that business\ntransacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited only to that business references in the notice of such meeting; and\nâ stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders,\nincluding proposed nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors.\nThese provisions could delay, until the next stockholdersâ meeting, actions which are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding\nvoting securities. These provisions may also discourage another person or entity from making a tender offer for our common stock, because a person or\nentity, even if it acquired a majority of our outstanding voting securities, would be able to take action as a stockholder only at a duly called stockholdersâ\nmeeting, and not by written consent.\n2\nSupermajority Votes Required\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law provides that the vote of a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote on any matter is\nrequired to amend a corporationâs certificate of incorporation or by-laws, unless a corporationâs certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as the case may be,\nrequires a greater percentage. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that, except as otherwise provided in our amended and restated bylaws, any\nvote required by stockholders pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, other than the election of directors, requires the vote of the holders of a\nmajority of each class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, if recommended by a majority of the continuing directors (as defined in our restated\ncertificate of incorporation) or, if not so recommended, 80% of each class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. In addition, our amended and\nrestated bylaws provide that (a) any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the\nshares then entitled to vote at the election of directors, (b) stockholders may only change the number of our board of directors by vote of 80% of the shares\nof our voting stock outstanding and (c) in the case of an amendment to our amended and restated bylaws that reduces any voting requirement, such\namendment shall require the vote that would have been required by such provision before such proposed amendment.\nBusiness Combinations\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is applicable to us. Section 203 restricts some types of transactions and business\ncombinations between a corporation and a 15% stockholder. A 15% stockholder is generally considered by Section 203 to be a person owning 15% or more\nof the corporationâs outstanding voting stock. Section 203 refers to a 15% stockholder as an âinterested stockholder.â Section 203 restricts these\ntransactions for a period of three years from the date the stockholder acquires 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. With some exceptions, unless\nthe transaction is approved by our board of directors and the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock, Section 203 prohibits significant\nbusiness transactions such as:\nâ a merger with, disposition of significant assets to or receipt of disproportionate financial benefits by the interested stockholder; and\nâ any other transaction that would increase the interested stockholderâs proportionate ownership of any class or series of our capital stock.\nThe shares held by the interested stockholder are not counted as outstanding when calculating the two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock\nneeded for approval.\nThe prohibition against these transactions does not apply if:\nâ prior to the time that any stockholder became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the\ntransaction in which such stockholder acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock; or\nâ the interested stockholder owns at least 85% of our outstanding voting stock as a result of a transaction in which such stockholder acquired\n15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Shares held by persons who are both directors and officers or by some types of employee stock\nplans are not counted as outstanding when making this calculation.\nExclusive Forum Provision\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware)\nwill be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of proceedings:\nâ any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nâ any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or stockholders to our company or\nour stockholders;\nâ any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or\nour by-laws; or\nâ any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware.\n3\nThese choice of forum provisions will not apply to causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, our by-laws provide that, unless\nwe consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the\nresolution of any claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Although our amended and restated bylaws contains the choice of forum provisions\ndescribed above, it is possible that a court could rule that such provisions are inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provisions are\nunenforceable.\nIndemnification\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director of our company shall be personally liable for any monetary damages for any\nbreach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directorâs duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts\nor omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our restated certificate of incorporation further\nprovides for the indemnification of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that we may indemnify, and may advance expenses, to each covered person who is a party to, or was or\nis threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved in any proceeding, as provided in our amended and restated bylaws and to the fullest extent\npermitted by applicable law.\n4\nExhibit 19\nInsider Trading and Confidentiality of Insider Information\n(effective as of February 1, 2022)\nPurpose:\nTo define the Companyâs rules on insider trading, to establish guidelines on the confidentiality of insider information, to prevent violations of insider\ntrading laws by Company personnel, and to avoid even the appearance of improper conduct in this regard by Company personnel.\nScope:\nThis policy applies to all Azenta personnel, including directors, officers, employees and consultants (collectively, âCompany Personnelâ).\nIntroduction:\nIn the normal course of business, Company Personnel may use or have access to confidential and material information which is not generally available to\nthe investing public. Because the Company is a public company, transactions in the Companyâs securities are subject to the federal securities laws and\nregulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Company Personnel have an important ethical and legal obligation not to engage\nin trading in securities while in possession of material non-public information (\"insider trading\") and to maintain the confidentiality of such non-public\ninformation. Insider trading is a crime; you and the Company (including âcontrolling personsâ of the Company discussed under Section 2 below) may be\nsubject to severe civil and criminal penalties as a result of trading in securities while in possession of material non-public information or as a result of\nunauthorized disclosure of material non-public information.\nPolicy:\n1. Prohibition. All Company Personnel are prohibited from:\n(a) buying or selling securities while in possession of material non-public information;\n(b) \"tipping\" or communicating material non-public information to others for other than legitimate corporate purposes;\n(c) recommending the purchase or sale of securities if material non-public information has not been disclosed by the Company; or\n(d) assisting anyone who is engaged in any of the above activities.\nIn addition to applying to the Company's securities, these prohibitions apply to information about, and securities of, other companies with which\nthe Company has a relationship and as a result of which you may acquire material non-public information, i.e., customers, suppliers, licensees,\nlicensors, joint ventures or companies with which the Company is considering entering into or terminating a material business relationship or other\nmaterial transaction. These prohibitions also apply to your family members, including your spouse, minor children or others living in your home.\nThe Company will hold you responsible for the conduct of your immediate family.\nFurthermore, if you become aware of a potential insider trading violation, you must immediately advise our CFO. You should also take steps,\nwhere appropriate, to prevent persons under your supervision and/or control from using material non-public information for trading purposes.\n2. Penalties. If you engage in any of the above activities, you may subject yourself, the Company, its officers and directors and other supervisory\npersonnel (âcontrolling personsâ) to civil and criminal liability. Trading on or tipping material non-public information may be penalized by\ncriminal fines of up to $5,000,000 (regardless of profit) and 20 years in jail for individuals. In addition, the SEC may seek the imposition of a civil\npenalty of up to three times the profit gained or losses avoided. Violators must also disgorge any profits made and are often subjected to an\ninjunction against future violations. Finally, under some circumstances, insider traders may be subjected to civil liability in private lawsuits.\nViolation of this Policy will be dealt with severely by the Company and may subject you to immediate discharge. These penalties apply to all\nCompany Personnel worldwide, not just US citizens.\n3. Key Concepts.\n(a) Material Information. Information, whether favorable or unfavorable, is material if the disclosure of the information could affect the market for the\nsecurity or if a reasonable investor would consider the information important in making a decision to purchase or sell securities. If disclosure of\nthe information is likely to affect the market price of a security, the information is probably material.\nA few examples of the type of information which would usually be considered material are changes in estimates of earnings, increases or\ndecreases in dividend payments, stock splits or securities offerings, possible mergers and acquisitions, significant contracts, the termination of\nsignificant contracts, changes in management, breakthroughs in technology, the introduction of important product lines, major marketing changes,\nunusual gains or losses in major operations and financial liquidity problems. It is important to keep in mind that information need not be certain in\norder to be material; information that something is likely to happen, or even just that it may happen, can be considered material.\nIn determining whether information is material, the SEC will review such information after-the-fact, with the benefit of hindsight. Therefore any\nquestion about whether particular information is material should be resolved in favor of not trading. If you have any question as to whether\nparticular information is material, you should not trade or communicate the information to anyone, without prior approval by the CFO.\n(b) Non-public Information. \"Non-public\" information is any information that has not been disclosed generally to the investing public. One must be\nable to point to some fact or event to show that the information is generally public, such as inclusion in the Company's periodic reports filed with\nthe SEC, the issuance of a press release, reference to the information in publications of general circulation such as The Wall Street Journal or the\nNew York Times or inclusion on the Companyâs external website. Even after the Company has released information to the press and the\ninformation has been reported, at least one business days must be allowed for the investing public to absorb and evaluate the information before\nyou may trade in the Company's securities (you may not trade until the second business day after the information is announced to the public). For\ncertain announcements of dramatic information, the CFO may designate an additional time period before you will be permitted to trade. See also\nSection 5 below for trading information with respect to certain Company Personnel during other âQuiet Periods.â\nPage 2\n(c) Tipping Information to Others. You may not disclose any material non-public information to others, including your family members, friends or\nsocial acquaintances. This prohibition applies whether or not you receive any benefit from the other person's use of that information.\n4. Additional Restrictions on Trading-Applicable to All Company Personnel. In addition to the prohibition on trading while in possession of material\ninside information described above, ALL Company Personnel are prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities: (a) short sales on\nthe Companyâs securities; (b) use of the Companyâs securities to secure a margin or other loan; (c) transactions in the Companyâs securities\ninvolving straddles, collars or other similar risk reduction or hedging devices; and (d) transactions in publicly-traded options relating to the\nCompanyâs securities (i.e., options that are not granted by the Company).\n5. Restrictions on Trading During Quiet Periods. With the exception of certain transactions conducted under program trading plans enacted under\nSEC Rule 10b5-1 or the like (discussed more fully in Section 7 below), certain Company Personnel are prohibited from purchasing or selling the\nCompanyâs securities in the open market during any of the Companyâs specified âQuiet Periodsâ or during any additional periods designated from\ntime to time by the CFO (this restriction does not apply to automatic sales of stock to cover withholding taxes made pursuant to a pre-existing\nelection or to purchases of stock made pursuant to the Companyâs 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, but Company Personnel cannot sell the\nshares purchased pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the quiet period). The Companyâs âQuiet Periodsâ begin on the tenth day\nof the third month of each fiscal quarter and end at the close of business on the first business day following the public release of the Companyâs\nquarterly financial results. This means that (subject to compliance with the other restrictions set forth in this Policy, including Sections 1 and 4\nabove) any Company Personnel may sell on the second business day after earnings are released.\nThis Section 5 applies to the following categories of Company Personnel:\n(a) All executive officers, directors, any member of the CEOâs senior staff, and any employee holding the title of Senior Director or above;\n(b) All Country Managers and Managing Directors worldwide;\n(c) All Business Unit Directors and Product Line Directors;\n(d) All Company Personnel in the Finance Department holding the title of Manager or above; and\n(e) All other Company Personnel designated by an executive officer as having access to the Companyâs financial statements (whether\nconsolidated or business unit profit and loss) as part of his/her normal job responsibilities.\nAll Company Personnel, even if not included in the categories listed above, are subject to the restrictions set forth in Sections 1 and 4 above.\nPage 3\n6. No Exceptions. Other than as described in Section 5 above and Section 7 below, there are no exceptions to the prohibitions and restrictions set\nforth in this Policy. Transactions in the Company's securities that are otherwise necessary for personal reasons, such as personal financial\ncommitments, are prohibited if you possess material non-public information. The SEC takes the view that the mere fact that you know the\ninformation is enough to bar you from trading; it is no excuse that your reasons for trading were not based on that information.\n7. Exception for Approved Program Trading. At present, other than as described in Section 5 above, the only exception to the prohibition against\nCompany Personnel covered by Section 5 above trading during quiet periods arises when any individual has entered into an approved program\ntrading plan enacted under SEC Rule 10b5-1. These are plans that specify in advance when trades in Azenta stock will be made, and in some cases\nthose trades can be made during quiet periods if the plan itself was entered into when the individual was not in possession of material, non-public\ninformation. The plans themselves cannot be entered into during a quiet period. In addition, any such plan must be reviewed and approved in\nadvance by Azentaâ CFO and General Counsel. Once a trading plan has been entered into and approved, you must not exercise any further\ninfluence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trades. The rules governing these\nplans can be quite complex and the plans can be very inflexible. Moreover, the SEC does not favor amendments to these plans once they are\nenacted. These plans also need to comply with all other relevant SEC and Azenta rules concerning insider trading. For these reasons, anyone\nconsidering such a plan should obtain professional advice.\n8. Inadvertent Disclosure. If material non-public information is inadvertently disclosed by any Company Personnel, you should immediately report\nthe facts to the CFO so that the Company may take appropriate remedial action.\n9. Company Assistance. If you have any question about specific information or proposed transactions, or as to the applicability or interpretation of\nthis Policy or the propriety of any desired action, you are encouraged to contact the CFO.\n10. Confidentiality Guidelines. To provide more effective protection against the disclosure of material non-public information, the Company has\nadopted guidelines (listed below) with which you should familiarize yourself. These guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Additional\nmeasures to secure the confidentiality of information should be undertaken as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If you have any doubt\nas to your responsibilities under these guidelines, please seek clarification and guidance from the CFO before you act. Do not try to resolve any\nuncertainties on your own.\n11. Certification. All Company Personnel will be required to certify their understanding of and intent to comply with this Policy by means of the\nCertification attached hereto. Officers and directors may be required to certify on an annual basis that they have complied with this Policy.\n12. No New Legal Liabilities. The policies set forth in this Statement of the Policy do not impose on Company Personnel or on the Company itself\nany new legal liabilities to which they would not otherwise be subjected.\nPage 4\n13. Restrictions Applicable to All Transactions by Officers and Directors.\na) Executive officers and directors, as well as members of their households, must obtain the prior approval of the CFO or General Counsel for all\ntransactions, including purchases or sales, in the Company's securities. If you are an officer or director or one of their household members and\nare considering the possible purchase or sale of the Company's securities or the securities of other companies, you must contact the CFO or\nGeneral Counsel before undertaking the transaction to be sure that there are no important developments pending that would prevent you from\ntrading, even if the Company is not currently in a quiet period. If CFO or General Counsel approval is given, it is only effective for 48 hours.\nFor those enacting program trading plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1, arrangements must be made at the time the plan is established to comply\nwith this requirement.\nb) Executive officers and directors must hold Azenta stock purchased in the open market for a minimum of six-months before selling (applies to\nany lot of stock, not on a lot-by-lot basis). For example, if an executive officer or director buys Azenta stock on January 1st, he or she may not\nsell any of his or her Azenta stock before July 1st. If there is a purchase and a sale (or a sale and then purchase) with a six-month window, the\nSEC âshort swing profitâ rule applies and all gains associated with these transactions would need to be paid back to the Company.\nConfidentiality Guidelines\nThe following guidelines establish procedures with which all Company Personnel should comply in order to maximize the security of confidential\ninside information:\n(a) declining any comment with respect to outside inquiries (from analysts, stock brokers, the press, etc.) and referring them immediately to the\nCFO to be addressed;\n(b) using code names for sensitive projects;\n(c) using passwords to restrict access to sensitive information on the computer system;\n(d) limiting access to particular physical areas where material non-public information is likely to be documented or discussed;\n(e) locking up or shredding confidential documents;\n(f) not discussing confidential matters in public places such as elevators, hallways, rest rooms or eating facilities where conversations might be\nheard;\n(g) marking sensitive documents \"Confidential\" and using sealed envelopes marked \"Confidential\";\n(h) restricting the copying of sensitive documents;\n(i) maintaining a sign-out system for sensitive documents;\n(j) obtaining written confidentiality agreements from outsiders allowed access to confidential information;\n(k) maintaining and periodically reviewing the list of persons who have access to confidential information and limiting access of especially\nsensitive materials to senior personnel and others on a need to know basis;\n(l) never leaving confidential documents unattended;\n(m) specifically informing Company Personnel who are exposed to confidential information of the sensitive nature of such information and the\nneed to maintain confidentiality; and\nPage 5\n(n) in telecopying sensitive matters, verifying that you have the correct telecopy number and that someone with authorized access to the\ninformation will be available to receive it at the incoming telecopy machine.\nResponsibilities:\nâ Local Human Resources managers are responsible for providing new employees and consultants with this Policy, and for obtaining a signed\ncertification of all new employees and consultants indicating that they understand and will comply with this Policy.\nâ The CFO and General Counsel are responsible for providing new officers and directors with this Policy and for obtaining, if requested, a signed annual\ncertification of each officer and director indicating that such officer or director has complied with this Policy.\nâ Managers and supervisors are responsible for periodically reminding Company Personnel of the requirements of this Policy, and for ensuring that\nCompany Personnel are complying with the Confidentiality Guidelines.\nPage 6\nEXHIBIT 21.01\nAZENTA, INC.\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nLegal Entity Jurisdiction\nAzenta Beijing Technologies Limited China\nAzenta (Guangzhou) Life Science Co., Ltd.

Introduction\nThe Board of Directors (the âBoardâ) of Azenta, Inc. (the âCompanyâ) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders\nto create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Companyâs pay-for-performance compensation\nphilosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an\naccounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the âPolicyâ). This\nPolicy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Actâ) and final rules and amendments\nadopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) to implement the aforementioned legislation.\nII. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the\nâCommitteeâ) of the Board, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Committee. Any determinations made by the\nBoard shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nIII. Covered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Companyâs current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with the requirements of\nSection 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC and any national securities exchange on which the Companyâs\nsecurities are listed, and such other employees who may from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Board (âCovered Executivesâ).\nIV. Incentive-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, incentive-based compensation (âIncentive-Based Compensationâ) includes any compensation that is granted, earned,\nor vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles (âGAAP Measuresâ) used in preparing the Companyâs financial statements and any measures derived wholly or in part from such\nmeasures, as well as non-GAAP Measures, stock price, and total shareholder return (collectively, âFinancial Reporting Measuresâ); however, it does not\ninclude: (i) base salaries; (ii) discretionary cash bonuses; (iii) awards (either cash or equity) that are solely based upon subjective, strategic or operational\nstandards or standards unrelated to Financial Reporting Measures, and (iv) equity awards that vest solely on completion of a specified employment period\nor without any performance condition. Incentive-Based Compensation is considered received in the fiscal period during which the applicable reporting\nmeasure is attained, even if the payment or grant of such award occurs after the end of that period. If an award is subject to both time-based and\nperformance-based vesting conditions, the award is considered received upon satisfaction of the performance-based conditions, even if such an award\ncontinues to be subject to the time-based vesting conditions.\nFor the purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation may include, among other things, any of the following:\nâ Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives.\nâ Stock options.\nâ Stock appreciation rights.\nâ Restricted stock or restricted stock units.\nâ Performance shares or performance units.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measures may include, among other things, any of the following:\nâ Company stock price.\nâ Total shareholder return.\nâ Revenues.\nâ Net income.\nâ Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\nâ Funds from operations.\nâ Liquidity measures such as working capital or operating cash flow.\nâ Return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets.\nâ Earnings measures such as earnings per share.\nV. Recoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Companyâs material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in\npreviously issued financial statements that (i) is material to the previously issued financial statements or (ii) is not material to previously issued financial\nstatements, but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, the\nBoard will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive-Based Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three\ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement (the âLook-Back Periodâ).\nFor the purposes of this Policy, the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement is the earlier of (i) the date the Board\nconcludes or reasonably should have concluded that the Company is required to prepare a restatement to correct a material error, and (ii) the date a court,\nregulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to restate its previously issued financial statements to correct a material error. The\nCompanyâs obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\nRecovery of the Incentive-Based Compensation is only required when the excess award is received by a Covered Executive (i) after the beginning\nof their service as a Covered Executive, (ii) who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based\nCompensation, (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (iv) during\nthe Look-Back Period immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement.\nVI. Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery is the amount the Covered Executive received in excess of the amount of\nIncentive-Based Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated financial statements, as determined\nby the Board. The amount subject to recovery will be calculated on a pre-tax basis.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation received as cash awards, the erroneously awarded compensation is the difference between the amount of the\ncash award that was received (whether payable in a lump sum or over time) and the amount that should have been received applying the restated Financial\nReporting Measure. For cash awards paid from bonus pools, the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is the pro rata portion of any\ndeficiency that results from the aggregate bonus pool that is reduced based on applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation received as equity awards that are still held at the time of recovery, the amount subject to recovery is the\nnumber of shares or other equity awards received or vested in excess of the number that should have been received or vested applying the restated Financial\nReporting Measure. If the equity award has been exercised, but the underlying shares have not been sold, the erroneously awarded compensation is the\nnumber of shares underlying the award.\nIn instances where the Company is not able to determine the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation directly from the\ninformation in the accounting restatement, the amount will be based on the Companyâs reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on\nthe applicable measure. In such instances, the Company will maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate.\nVII. Method of Recoupment\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law, the method for recouping Incentive-Based Compensation hereunder,\nwhich may include, without limitation:\nâ requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid;\n2\nâ seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\nâ offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\nâ cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\nâ taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\nVIII. No Indemnification; Successors\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. This\nPolicy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\nIX. Exception to Enforcement\nThe Board shall recover any excess Incentive-Based Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as\ndetermined by the Board in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC and the listing\nstandards of any national securities exchange on which the Companyâs securities are listed.\nX. Interpretation\nThe Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the\nadministration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the\nExchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC and any national securities exchange on which the Companyâs securities are listed.\nXI. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the âEffective Dateâ) and shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by a\nCovered Executive on or after that date, as determined by the Board in accordance with applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC and the listing\nstandards of any national securities exchange on which the Companyâs securities are listed.\nXII. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with any rules or\nstandards adopted by the SEC and the listing standards of any national securities exchange on which the Companyâs securities are listed. The Board may\nterminate this Policy at any time.\nXIII. Other Recoupment Rights\nAny right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to\nthe Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal\nremedies available to the Company.\nApproved by The Board of Directors on November 2, 2023, effective as of October 2, 2023\n3"
