We are committed to focusing on product differentiation and providing great value for our customers. We achieved our highest-ever quarterly company owned and operated store contribution margin of 13.3%, a year-over-year margin expansion of 5.8 percentage points, demonstrating our continuous efforts towards delivering further improvements in operational efficiencies and supply chain capabilities.\n\nFurthering our strategic focus, we prioritize delivering healthy and high-quality products and services to our customers. We have completed the “made-to-order” renovation of 539 new and existing stores by the end of October, adding working stations designed for efficient, fresh and handmade food preparation and “open kitchens.” With this investment, our guests can watch our staff craft fresh meals from start to finish.”\n\nMr. Dong (Albert) Li, CFO of Tims China, commented, “In the third quarter of 2024, we delivered adjusted corporate EBITDA profitability again. We remain dedicated to enhancing our financial performance by refining our store unit economics and driving efficiencies at the corporate level. Concurrently, our rapidly growing sub-franchise business continues to generate a steady stream of cash flow and profitability, bolstering our margins. We substantially improved our store profitability and delivered year-over-year reductions in food and packaging costs, labor costs, and other store operating expenses (as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores) by 6.1 percentage points, 3.0 percentage points, and 1.1 percentage points, respectively. Our marketing expenses and adjusted general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 2.3 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points year-over-year, respectively.”\n\nMr. Li continued, “Moving forward, our strategic focus remains firmly on delivering profitable, capital-efficient growth. We are committed to bolstering our brand and broadening our appeal by offering great value for money with our fresh and healthy food selections. Additionally, we are collaborating closely with our sub-franchisees to boost customer traffic and optimize our supply chain efficiency, thereby enhancing overall store economics and our bottom-line profitability.”\n\n**THIRD** **QUARTER** **2024** **FINANCIAL** **RESULTS**\n\n**Total revenues** reached RMB359.6 million (USD51.3 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 17.1% from RMB433.9 million in the same quarter of 2023. Total revenues comprise:\n\n  * **_Revenues from Company owned and operated store sales_** were RMB299.5 million (USD42.7 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 22.9% from RMB388.3 million in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to closures of certain underperforming stores and a 20.7% decrease in same-store sales growth for company owned and operated stores in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was attributable to a 12.3% decline in the number of orders from 15.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 13.5 million in the same quarter of 2024, and a 12.0% year-over-year decrease in average ticket size.\n  * **_Other revenues_** were RMB60.1 million (USD8.6 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 31.8% from RMB45.6 million in the same quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our franchise business as the number of our franchised stores increased from 174 as of September 30, 2023 to 382 as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Company owned and operated store costs and expenses** were RMB279.6 million (USD39.9 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 29.0% from RMB394.1 million in the same quarter of 2023. Company owned and operated store costs and expenses comprise:\n\n  * **_Food and packaging costs_** were RMB86.9 million (USD12.4 million), representing a decrease of 36.3% from RMB136.3 million, as we continue to benefit from higher efficiencies in supply chains and cost reduction on raw materials, logistic and warehousing expenses. Accordingly, food and packaging costs as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores decreased by 6.1 percentage points from 35.1% in the third quarter of 2023 to 29.0% in the same quarter of 2024.\n  * **_Rental and property management fee_** was RMB57.8 million (USD8.2 million), representing a decrease of 23.1% from RMB75.1 million, mainly due to the closure of certain underperforming stores and in line with the revenue trend. Rental and property management fee as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores remained flat at 19.3% in both the third quarter of 2023 and 2024.\n  * **_Payroll and employee benefits expenses_** were RMB50.7 million (USD7.2 million), representing a decrease of 34.5% from RMB77.3 million. Payroll and employee benefits as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores decreased by 3.0 percentage points from 19.9% in the third quarter of 2023 to 16.9% in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to the continuous refinement of staffing arrangements and optimization of store managerial efficiency.\n  * **_Delivery costs_** were RMB30.8 million (USD4.4 million), representing a decrease of 9.8% from RMB34.2 million, which was in line with the trend of delivery orders. Delivery costs as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores increased by 1.5 percentage points to 10.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.8% in the same quarter of 2023.\n  * **_Other operating expenses_** were RMB23.7 million (USD3.4 million), representing a decrease of 32.0% from RMB34.8 million, driven by the cost optimization measures and in line with the revenue trend. Other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores decreased by 1.1 percentage points to 7.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 9.0% in the same quarter of 2023.\n  * **_Store depreciation and amortization expenses_** were RMB29.8 million (USD4.2 million), representing a decrease of 18.1% from RMB36.4 million, which was attributable to the closure of certain underperforming stores and in line with the revenue trend. Store depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores increased by 0.5 percentage points to 9.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 9.4% in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Costs for other revenues** were RMB45.3 million (USD6.5 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 7.6% from RMB42.1 million in the same quarter of 2023, which was primarily driven by an increase in the revenues generated from franchise business as the number of our franchised stores increased from 174 as of September 30, 2023 to 382 as of September 30, 2024, offset by the streamlined e-commerce business. Costs for other revenues as a percentage of other revenues decreased by 16.9 percentage points from 92.3% in the third quarter of 2023 to 75.4% in the same quarter of 2024 due to higher margins we generated from both franchise business and e-commerce business during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Marketing expenses** were RMB18.5 million (USD2.6 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 42.1% from RMB32.0 million in the same quarter of 2023, driven by our cost optimization measures and higher brand influence. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 2.3 percentage points from 7.4% in the third quarter of 2023 to 5.1% in the same quarter of 2024.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** were RMB39.8 million (USD5.7 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 39.6% from RMB65.8 million in the same quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to: (i) a reduction of our headquarter headcount and cost optimization measures; (ii) decrease in share-based compensation expenses; and (iii) decrease in professional fees. **Adjusted general and administrative expenses** , which excludes share-based compensation expenses of RMB1.4 million (USD0.2 million), were RMB38.4 million (USD5.5 million), representing a decrease of 39.5% from RMB63.4 million in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 2.7 percentage points from 13.4% in the third quarter of 2023 to 10.7% in the same quarter of 2024**.** For more information on the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this earnings release.\n\n**Franchise and royalty expenses** were RMB15.6 million (USD2.2 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 3.4% from RMB15.1 million in the same quarter of 2023, which was primarily driven by the increase in the number of our system-wide stores from 759 as of September 30, 2023 to 946 as of September 30, 2024, offset by a 15.5% year-over-year decrease in system sales. Franchise and royalty expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased by 0.9 percentage points, from 3.5% in the third quarter of 2023 to 4.4% in the same quarter of 2024 due to the increase of amortized upfront franchise fees.\n\n**Impairment losses of long-lived assets** were RMB15.6 million (USD2.2 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to RMB13.0 million in the same quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to the planned closing of underperforming company owned and operated stores.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, **operating loss** was RMB55.9 million (USD8.0 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a significant reduction compared to RMB147.7 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n**Adjusted Corporate EBITDA** was a gain of RMB2.0 million (USD0.3 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of RMB63.0 million in the same quarter of 2023. **Adjusted Corporate EBITDA margin** was positive 0.6% in the third quarter of 2024, representing an improvement of 15.1 percentage points from negative 14.5% in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net loss from continuing operations** was RMB87.4 million (USD12.5 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to RMB147.6 million for the same quarter of 2023. **Adjusted net loss** was RMB41.4 million (USD5.9 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to RMB100.1 million for the same quarter of 2023.

The change was primarily attributable to the financing from our founding shareholders, partially offset by cash disbursements on the back of the expansion of our business and store network nationwide and the repayment of certain bank borrowings.\n\n**KEY OPERATING DATA**\n\nTims only| For the three months ended or as of  \n---|---  \n（Exclude the discontinued business)| Sep 30,| Dec 31,| Mar 31,| Jun 30,| Sep 30,  \n2023 | 2023 | 2024 | 2024 | 2024   \nTotal stores| 759| 902| 906| 907| 946  \nCompany owned and operated stores| 585| 619| 604| 574| 564  \nFranchised stores| 174| 283| 302| 333| 382  \nSame-store sales growth for system-wide stores| 0.1%| 2.6%| -13.6%| -14.6| %| -21.7%  \nSame-store sales growth for company owned and operated stores| -0.4%| 2.5%| -11.7%| -13.8| %| -20.7%  \nRegistered loyalty club members (in thousands)| 16,867| 18,545| 20,009| 21,403| 22,815  \nCompany owned and operated store contribution (Renminbi in thousands)| 29,010| 15,714| 7,241| 33,154| 39,922  \nCompany owned and operated store contribution margin| 7.5%| 4.8%| 2.4%| 10.3%| 13.3%  \n  \n**KEY DEFINITIONS**\n\n  * Same-store sales growth.

Mr. Yongchen Lu, CEO & Director of Tims China, took part in a panel discussion titled “Consensus on New Green Consumption Concepts.” Tims China is keenly focused on sustainable development in all aspects of our business, from our coffee cups to our furnishings.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThe Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, namely company owned and operated store contribution, company owned and operated store contribution margin, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted corporate EBITDA, adjusted corporate EBITDA margin, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin, and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company defines (i) company owned and operated store contribution as fully burdened gross profit of company owned and operated stores excluding depreciation and amortization; (ii) company owned and operated store contribution margin as company owned and operated store contribution as a percentage of revenues from company owned and operated stores; (iii) adjusted general and administrative expenses as general and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses, expenses related to the Commitment Shares, the ESA Offering Costs, and expenses related to the Option Shares, and professional fees related to warrant exchange and other financing programs; (iv) adjusted corporate EBITDA as operating loss for continuing operations excluding certain non-cash expenses consisting of depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expenses, expenses related to the Commitment Shares, the ESA Offering Costs, expenses related to the Option Shares, professional fees related to warrant exchange and other financing programs, impairment losses of long-lived assets, and loss on disposal of property and equipment; (v) adjusted corporate EBITDA margin as adjusted corporate EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues; (vi) adjusted net loss as net loss for continuing operations excluding share-based compensation expenses, expenses related to the Commitment Shares, the ESA Offering Costs, expenses related to the Option Shares, professional fees related to warrant exchange and other financing programs, impairment losses of long-lived assets, loss on disposal of property and equipment, changes in fair value of convertible notes, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in fair value of ESA derivative liabilities, loss of the debt extinguishment and gain on disposal of Popeyes business; (vii) adjusted net loss margin as adjusted net loss as a percentage of total revenues; and (viii) adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share as adjusted net loss for continuing operations attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders divided by weighted-average number of basic and diluted ordinary share. The Company believes company owned and operated store contribution, company owned and operated store contribution margin, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted corporate EBITDA, adjusted corporate EBITDA margin, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin, and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share enhance investors' overall understanding of its financial performance and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures.” The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\n\n**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**\n\nThis earnings release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“USD”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
