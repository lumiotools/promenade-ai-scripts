(“GBDC 3”), respectively. Each acquisition was accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805-50, Business Combinations — Related Issues. Under asset acquisition accounting, where the consideration paid to GCIC and GBDC 3’s stockholders exceeded the relative fair values of the assets acquired, the premium paid by the Company was allocated to the cost of the GCIC and GBDC 3 investments acquired by the Company pro-rata based on their relative fair value. Immediately following each acquisition, the Company recorded its assets at their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium allocated to the cost basis of the assets acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to investments in loan securities acquired from GCIC and GBDC 3 will amortize over the life of the loans through interest income with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to investments in equity securities will not amortize over the life of the equity securities through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the GCIC and GBDC 3 equity securities acquired and disposition of such equity securities at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation upon disposition of the GCIC and GBDC 3 equity securities acquired.  As a supplement to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures, the Company is providing the following non-GAAP financial measures that it believes are useful for the reasons described below: \n\n  * **“Adjusted Net Investment Income”** and **“Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share”** – excludes the amortization of the purchase premium from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n  * **“Adjusted Net Investment Income Before Accrual for Capital Gain Incentive Fee** ” - Adjusted Net Investment Income excluding the accrual or reversal for the capital gain incentive fee required under GAAP; \n  * **“Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss)”** and **“Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Per Share”** – excludes the unrealized loss resulting from the purchase premium write-down and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized loss from the amortization of the premium from the determination of realized and unrealized gain/(loss) in accordance with GAAP. \n  * **“Adjusted Net Income/(Loss)”** and **“Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share”** – calculates net income and earnings per share based on Adjusted Net Investment Income and Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss). \n\nThe Company believes that excluding the financial impact of the purchase premium write down in the above non-GAAP financial measures is useful for investors as it is a non-cash expense/loss resulting from the acquisitions of GCIC and GBDC 3 and is one method the Company uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company believes excluding the accrual of the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP is useful as a portion of such accrual is not contractually payable under the terms of the Company’s investment advisory agreement with GC Advisors.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net investment income per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $0.45 as compared to $0.46 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Excluding $0.02 per share in purchase premium amortization from the GCIC/GBDC 3 acquisitions, Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share 1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $0.47. This compares to Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share 1 of $0.48 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 when excluding $0.02 per share in purchase premium amortization from the GCIC/GBDC 3 acquisitions and no accrual or reversal for the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP. \n  * Net realized and unrealized gain/(loss) per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $(0.09). Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Per Share 1 was $(0.11) when excluding $0.02 per share net reversal of unrealized depreciation and realized loss resulting from the amortization of the purchase premium. The Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Per Share 1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net realized losses recognized on the restructuring of four portfolio companies that were partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains recognized on the translation of foreign currency transactions. For additional analysis, please refer to the Quarter Ended 9.30.2024 Earnings Presentation available on the Investor Resources link on the homepage of the Company's website ([www.golubcapitalbdc.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.golubcapitalbdc.com&esheet=54155403&newsitemid=20241119236352&lan=en-US&anchor=www.golubcapitalbdc.com&index=1&md5=c44430d1afd7c3ebed1270b76afce364)) under Events/Presentations. The Earnings Presentation was also filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a Form 8-K. These results compare to net realized and unrealized gain/(loss) per share of $(0.41) during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Per Share 1 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $(0.17) when excluding $0.02 per share net reversal of unrealized depreciation and realized loss resulting from the amortization of the purchase premium and $0.26 per share reversal of unrealized loss resulting from the one-time write-down of the purchase premium allocated to the investments acquired from Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. (“GBDC 3”). \n  * Earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $0.36 as compared to $0.05 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Adjusted Earnings Per Share 1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $0.36 as compared to $0.31 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * Net asset value per share decreased to $15.19 at September 30, 2024 from $15.32 at June 30, 2024. \n  * On June 2, 2024, our board of directors declared a series of special distributions totaling $0.15 per share, distributed in three consecutive quarterly payments of $0.05 per share per quarter. The first and second special distributions were paid to stockholders on June 27, 2024 and September 13, 2024, respectively. The remaining special distribution is payable on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. \n  * On September 13, 2024 we paid a supplemental distribution of $0.04 per share, and a special distribution of $0.05 per share. On September 27, 2024 we paid a quarterly distribution of $0.39 per share. \n  * On November 14, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.39 per share, which is payable on December 27, 2024, to stockholders of record as of December 9, 2024 and a supplemental distribution of $0.04 per share, which is payable on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. For additional details on the framework we intend to use for determining the amount of supplemental distributions going forward, please refer to the Quarter Ended 9.30.2024 Earnings Presentation available on the Investor Resources link on the homepage of the Company's website ([www.golubcapitalbdc.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.golubcapitalbdc.com&esheet=54155403&newsitemid=20241119236352&lan=en-US&anchor=www.golubcapitalbdc.com&index=2&md5=ea1c20aed910a606248fb6be9bd22b31)) under Events/Presentations. \n  * During the three months ended September 30, 2024, GBDC repurchased approximately $4.8 million, or 331,928 shares, of our common stock pursuant to the Company’s previously disclosed share repurchase program. \n  * During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Golub Capital Employee Grant Program Rabbi Trust (the “Trust”) purchased approximately $8.1 million, or 539,702 shares, of our common stock for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. Through the first three calendar quarters of 2024, the Trust purchased approximately $8.2 million, or 544,702 shares, of our common stock. \n\n\n\n_________________________  \n---  \n1  See footnote 1 to “Selected Financial Highlights” above.   \n  \n**Portfolio and Investment Activities**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had investments in 381 portfolio companies with a total fair value of $8,235.4 million. This compares to the Company’s portfolio as of June 30, 2024, as of which date the Company had investments in 380 portfolio companies with a total fair value of $7,867.5 million. Investments in portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 consisted of the following: \n\n**As of September 30, 2024** |  **As of June 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Investments** |  **Percentage of** |  **Investments** |  **Percentage of**  \n**at Fair Value** |  **Total** |  **at Fair Value** |  **Total**  \n**Investment Type** |  **(In thousands)** |  **Investments** |  **(In thousands)** |  **Investments**  \nSenior secured  |  $  |  502,386  |  6.1  |  %  |  $  |  567,375  |  7.2  |  %   \nOne stop  |  7,110,258  |  86.3  |  6,734,334  |  85.6   \nJunior debt * |  44,229  |  0.6  |  40,270  |  0.5   \nEquity  |  578,538  |  7.0  |  525,535  |  6.7   \nTotal  |  $  |  8,235,411  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  7,867,514  |  100.0  |  %   \n  \n* |  Junior debt is comprised of second lien and subordinated debt.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2024: \n\n**New Investment**  \n---  \n**Commitments** |  **Percentage of**  \n**(In thousands)** |  **Commitments**  \nSenior secured  |  $  |  58,796  |  5.9  |  %   \nOne stop  |  933,652  |  93.4   \nJunior debt * |  1,879  |  0.2   \nEquity  |  5,493  |  0.5   \nTotal new investment commitments  |  $  |  999,820  |  100.0  |  %   \n  \n*  |  Junior debt is comprised of second lien and subordinated debt.   \n---|---  \n  \nTotal investments in portfolio companies at fair value were $8,235.4 million at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, total assets were $8,706.0 million, net assets were $4,014.5 million and net asset value per share was $15.19. \n\n**Consolidated Results of Operations**\n\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, the Company reported GAAP net income of $95.2 million or $0.36 per share and Adjusted Net Income 2  of $95.2 million or $0.36 per share. GAAP net investment income was $119.6 million or $0.45 per share and Adjusted Net Investment Income 1 was $125.8 million or $0.47 per share. GAAP net realized and unrealized gain/(loss) was ($24.6) million or ($0.09) per share and Adjusted Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) 1 was ($30.7) million or ($0.11) per share. \n\nNet income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net income may not be meaningful. \n\n_________________________  \n---  \n2  See footnote 1 to “Selected Financial Highlights” above.   \n  \n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources are derived from the Company’s debt securitizations (also known as collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs), unsecured notes, revolving credit facilities and cash flow from operations. The Company’s primary uses of funds from operations include investments in portfolio companies and payment of fees and other expenses that the Company incurs. The Company has used, and expects to continue to use, its debt securitizations, unsecured notes, revolving credit facilities, proceeds from its investment portfolio and proceeds from offerings of its securities and its dividend reinvestment plan to finance its investment objectives. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and foreign currencies of $131.2 million, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of $228.4 million, which included $136.3 million of restricted cash retained for partial repayments on the notes of certain of our debt securitizations that are past their reinvestment period term, and $4,624.8 million of debt outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had approximately $865.9 million of remaining availability, in the aggregate, on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan and approximately $113.9 million of availability on our revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had $200.0 million of remaining commitments and availability on our unsecured line of credit with GC Advisors. \n\nOn August 6, 2024, we amended our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan to, among other things, increase the aggregate commitments outstanding to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion and extend the maturity date to August 6, 2029 from March 17, 2028. \n\nOn November 15, 2024, we entered into an agreement to increase the aggregate commitments outstanding under our credit facility with JPMorgan to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. \n\nOn November 18, 2024, GBDC completed a $2.2 billion term debt securitization (the “2024 Debt Securitization”). In connection with the 2024 Debt Securitization closing, GBDC fully redeemed each of its (1) $602 million term debt securitization (the “2018 Debt Securitization”), (2) $908 million term debt securitization (the “GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization”) and (3) $399 million term debt securitization assumed from GBDC 3 (the “GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization”). In addition, on November 15, 2024, we issued a notice of redemption to redeem the $387 million term debt securitization assumed from GBDC 3 (the “GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization”), which is expected to occur on December 16, 2024. \n\nOn November 19, 2024, all amounts outstanding under the credit facility with Deutsche Bank we assumed from GBDC 3 were repaid, following which the agreements governing our credit facility with Deutsche Bank were terminated. \n\nThe Company estimates that our GAAP debt-to-equity ratio increased to 1.16x as of September 30, 2024 and our GAAP debt-to-equity ratio, net 3 increased to 1.12x as of September 30, 2024. \n\n_________________________  \n---  \n3  GAAP debt to equity, net is calculated as (1) total debt reduced by available cash, cash equivalents, and foreign currencies, divided by (2) total net assets.   \n  \n**Portfolio and Asset Quality**\n\nGC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of the Company’s investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors’ internal performance ratings: \n\n**Internal Performance Ratings**  \n---  \n**Rating** |  **Definition**  \n**5** |  Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable.   \n**4** |  Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.   \n**3** |  Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due.   \n**2** |  Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).   \n**1** |  Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has substantially increased since origination.

Announces a Series of Debt Funding Structure Initiatives Aimed at Reducing Borrowing Costs and Providing Additional Investment Flexibility\n\n11/18/2024\n\nDownload (opens in new window)\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Golub Capital BDC, Inc. (“GBDC” or the “Company”), a business development company (Nasdaq: GBDC), and Golub Capital, today announced a series of debt funding structure initiatives expected to reduce GBDC’s prospective borrowing costs and provide additional investment flexibility: \n\n  1. On November 18, 2024, GBDC completed a $2.2 billion term debt securitization, also referred to as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO)(“2024 Debt Securitization”). The secured notes were issued by the Company’s consolidated subsidiary Golub Capital BDC CLO 8 LLC and are backed by a portfolio of collateral obligations consisting of middle market loans. \n  2. In connection with the 2024 Debt Securitization closing, GBDC fully redeemed three of its existing term debt securitization financings: the $602.4 million 2018 Debt Securitization, the $908.2 million GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization and the $398.9 million GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization (collectively, the “Legacy GBDC and GBDC 3 Term Debt Securitizations”). \n  3. On November 15, 2024, GBDC also issued a notice of redemption to redeem the $386.6 million GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization in full, which is expected to occur on December 16, 2024. \n  4. GBDC announced certain changes to existing bank lending relationships. The Company announced an increase of aggregate commitments under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the “JPM Credit Facility”) from $1,822.5 million to $1,897.5 million with the addition of one new bank lending relationship. Further, the Company announced that it expects to terminate the senior secured revolving credit facility (the “DB Credit Facility”) assumed in the acquisition of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. by merger. \n\n\n\nGBDC believes this series of transactions represents a meaningful evolution of GBDC’s debt funding structure and is compelling for GBDC stockholders for several reasons: \n\n  * **Reduction in borrowing costs:** The 2024 Debt Securitization closing ($1.192 billion of senior AAA-rated notes priced at 3M SOFR plus 1.56%, and $171.6 million of junior AAA-rated notes priced at 3M SOFR plus 1.75%), redemption of the Legacy GBDC and GBDC 3 Term Debt Securitizations, and termination of the DB Credit Facility are expected to result in an immediate reduction in the Company’s overall weighted average cost of debt. \n  * **Extension of GBDC’s debt maturity ladder:** The 2024 Debt Securitization closing (October 2036 legal maturity and October 2028 reinvestment period), redemption of the Legacy GBDC and GBDC 3 Term Debt Securitizations, and termination of the DB Credit Facility materially extends the weighted average maturity of GBDC’s debt funding structure. \n  * **Incremental available liquidity to make investments:** The debt funding transactions provide for incremental liquidity, enabling GBDC to continue to provide first lien senior secured loans to healthy, resilient middle-market companies backed by strong, partnership-oriented private equity sponsors. \n  * **Maintains the Company’s differentiated ratings profile:** The Company expects no changes to its differentiated credit ratings profile (Baa3 (Positive)/BBB (Stable)/BBB- (Stable)) from Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings and expects to maintain a level of unsecured debt to total debt in excess of 40%. \n\n\n\n“GBDC has sought to deliver market-leading returns since its IPO in April 2010, and this evolution of the Company’s post-GBDC 3 merger debt funding structure is a significant step in furthering that objective,” said Matthew Benton, Chief Operating Officer of the Company. “These post-merger transactions, in combination with the incentive fee rate reduction that became permanent with the merger closing, achieves efficiencies of scale for the benefit of GBDC shareholders.” \n\n“Year-to-date Golub Capital has executed over $16 billion of securitizations across 23 unique transactions firmwide, retaining our spot as the market’s #1 issuer of middle market CLOs by volume. Completing the 2024 Debt Securitization for the benefit of GBDC shareholders, one of the largest CLOs on record, is a testament to the strength of the Golub Capital platform and leadership in the debt capital markets,” said Alan George, Head of Structured Products at Golub Capital. \n\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. will host an earnings conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, November 20, 2024. The Company will discuss its financial results for the quarter and the year ended September 30, 2024, and will provide additional detail on the aforementioned debt funding structure initiatives. \n\nAll interested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing (888) 330-3529 approximately 10-15 minutes prior to the call; international callers should dial (646) 960-0656.
