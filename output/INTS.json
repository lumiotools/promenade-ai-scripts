As a result of the saturation, Intensity's clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of INT230-6 to kill tumors and elicit an adaptive immune response within days of injection, representing a new approach to cancer cell death that holds the potential to shift the treatment paradigm and turn many deadly cancers into chronic diseases even for malignancies that do not respond to conventional immunotherapy. Intensity has completed two clinical studies and enrolled over 200 patients using INT230-6: a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study in metastatic cancers including sarcomas _[(NCT03058289](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03058289 \"Opens in a new window\")_), and a Phase 2 randomized control clinical trial in locally advanced breast cancer (the \"INVINCIBLE-2 Study\") ([NCT04781725](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04781725?term=INT230-6&rank=1 \"Opens in a new window\")) in women without undergoing chemotherapy prior to their surgery. The Company initiated a Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma (the \"INVINCIBLE-3 Study\") ([NCT06263231](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06263231?term=INT230-6&rank=3 \"Opens in a new window\")), testing INT230-6 as second or third-line monotherapy compared to the standard of care (\"SOC\") with overall survival as an endpoint. Intensity also initiated a Phase 2 study in collaboration with The Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research, SAKK (the \"INVINCIBLE-4 Study\") ([NCT06358573](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06358573?term=INT230-6&rank=4 \"Opens in a new window\")) as part of a Phase 2/3 program evaluating INT230-6 followed by the SOC immunochemotherapy and the SOC alone for patients with presurgical triple-negative breast cancer.

Dr. Meyer shared the information during an oral podium presentation in a late-breaking session at the 2024 Connective Tissue Oncology Society (\"CTOS\") on November 16, 2024, at 9 AM PST. The abstract's lead author was Albiruni Razak, MB BCh, BM BCh, Clinician Investigator, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre at the University Hospital Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Both Drs. Razak and Meyer, enrolled patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. This year's annual CTOS conference was held in San Diego from November 13 to 16, 2024 at the Grand Hyatt.\n\n[ ![Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Intensity Therapeutics Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2290007/Intensity_Therapeutics_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2290007/Intensity_Therapeutics_Inc_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\"The data in the Phase 1/2 study has shown that INT230-6 causes cell death leading to tumor necrosis, improved cancer recognition by immune cells, and an ignition of a systemic anti-cancer immune response that results in T-cells entering the tumor microenvironment and has shown a favorable safety profile in soft tissue sarcomas,\" said Dr. Razak. \"Systemically delivered chemotherapies have severe side effects, including cardiotoxicity, and most sarcoma subtypes have only a minimal response to immunotherapies. In addition, most sarcoma patients remain on current therapies for only a few months prior to progression, death or excessive toxicity. Demonstrating statistically significant improvement in median overall survival for the INT230-6 treatment arm compared to the standard of care arm in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study would be a major step forward in treating patients with these deadly soft tissue sarcomas.\"\n\n**Phase 1/2 Study (Sarcoma Subset Data: 15 Patients):**\n\n_Demographics_ :\n\n  * Median (min, max) lines for prior drug therapies: 3 (1.00, 7.00)\n  * Mean (SD) age: 62.8 (8.1) years and ranged from 41.9 to 76.1 years\n  * ECOG performance status at screening was 0, 1 and 2 for 2 (13.3%), 12 (80.0%), and 1 (6.7%) subjects respectively\n  * The sarcoma diagnoses of the Phase 2 patients included liposarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma (chondroid syringoma), myofibroblastic, osteosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma and chordoma\n\n\n\n_Efficacy_ :\n\n  * The mOS in the mixed sarcoma population: 21.3 months for INT230-6\n  * The mOS had not been reached with 21.4 months of median follow-up for patients who received a cumulative INT230-6 dose volume that was greater than 40% of their total tumor burden\n  * INT230-6 extended overall survival in refractory sarcoma subjects by nearly 15 months as monotherapy when compared to a synthetic control group based on the Royal Marsden Hospital scoring method\n  * Sarcoma population's overall disease control rate (DCR): 93.3% (95% CI: 68.1, 99.8) at 2 months\n  * Median duration of response (DOR): 4.0 months (95% CI: 1.7, NA) and 11.3 months (95% CI: 2.8, NA) for subjects who received a cumulative dose of ≥ 40% of the total incoming total tumor burden\n  * INT230-6 demonstrated an increase in T-cells within the tumors\n  * 27% of patients had uninjected tumors shrink (abscopal effects), though tumors less than 1 cm were uninjected, untracked and unreported by investigators, so the true abscopal percentage is unknown; further radiomics work is on-going\n\n\n\n_Safety_\n\n  * INT230-6 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated\n  * 3 subjects (20%) had one or more drug regimen-related Grade ≥ 3 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE); all were grade 3 (there were no grade 4 or 5 TEAEs)\n\n\n\n**INVINCIBLE-3 Study Overview** The INVINCIBLE-3 Study is designed to evaluate INT230-6 administered intratumorally by an interventional radiologist or an equivalently trained physician using image guidance compared to systemically dosed standard of care (\"SOC\") chemotherapy. The study endpoints are overall survival and safety, along with an exploratory quality of life (QoL) assessment using the EORTC-30 survey. This is a global randomized Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of INT230-6 intratumoral (IT) injection with any of three standard of care therapies (pazopanib, trabectedin, or eribulin) in approximately 333 adult participants with locally recurrent, inoperable, or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (\"STS\") patients who had disease progression prior to study enrollment following standard therapies, which must have included an anthracycline-based regimen unless contraindicated. Participants may also have received a maximum of one additional regimen. Randomization will occur after screening and eligibility confirmation. As this is a survival study, there is no crossover allowed between SOC and INT230-6. Disease progression will be determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Participants will be prospectively stratified into 1 of 3 histologically defined STS strata:\n\n  * leiomyosarcoma\n  * liposarcoma (dedifferentiated, myxoid, round cell and pleomorphic)\n  * undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma\n\n\n\nThe comparator agents used are all U.S., Europe, Canadian and Australian-approved agents for sarcomas: pazopanib tablets, trabectedin, and eribulin mesylate. Authorizations for the INVINCIBLE-3 Study have been obtained from the U.S. FDA, Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency, and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. Sites will be opened in 8 countries and the study is presently recruiting participants in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.\n\n\"The safety and efficacy data of our lead drug candidate, INT230-6, generated for sarcomas was quite encouraging. Many insights were gained from the over 200 patients treated before initiating the INVINCIBLE-3 study and applied to the ongoing study. Our approach uses sophisticated interventional radiology technologies to guide needles into tumors to inject our novel cytotoxic drug, which is highly absorbed by tumors, and showed a potential meaningful impact on lengthening metastatic sarcoma patient lives, reducing toxicities and improving quality of life compared to current treatments in our first clinical trial,\" said [Lewis H. Bender](https://intensitytherapeutics.com/company/senior-management-team/ \"Opens in a new window\"), Intensity's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our unique chemistry enables water-based products to diffuse throughout tumors and into cancer cells, causing immunologic cell death.\"\n\n**About INT230-6** INT230-6, Intensity's lead proprietary investigational product candidate, is designed for direct intratumoral injection. INT230-6 was discovered using Intensity's proprietary DfuseRx℠ technology platform. The drug is comprised of two proven, potent anti-cancer agents, cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate, and a penetration enhancer molecule (SHAO) that helps disperse potent cytotoxic drugs throughout tumors for diffusion into cancer cells. These agents remain in the tumor, resulting in a favorable safety profile. In addition to local disease control and direct tumor killing, INT230-6 causes a release of a bolus of neoantigens specific to the malignancy, leading to immune system engagement and systemic anti-tumor effects. Importantly, these effects are mediated without immunosuppression, which often occurs with systemic chemotherapy.\n\n**About Intensity Therapeutics** Intensity is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company whose novel engineered chemistry enables aqueous cytotoxic-containing drug formulations to mix and saturate a tumor's dense, high-fat, pressurized environment following direct intratumoral injection.

The primary endpoint in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study is overall survival.\n\n  * July 2024: the first patients were dosed in the U.S. in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study.\n  * July 2024: authorization received from Health Canada to initiate the INVINCIBLE-3 Study in Canada.\n  * September 2024: authorization received from The European Medicines Agency to initiate the INVINCIBLE-3 Study in Europe.\n  * October 2024: authorization received from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration to initiate INVINCIBLE-3 Study in Australia.\n\n\n\n_INVINCIBLE-4 Study_ : a Phase 2 randomized open-label, multicenter study to analyze the clinical activity, safety, and tolerability of INT230-6 given before administration of the standard of care (\"SOC\") treatment in patients with early-stage, operable triple-negative breast cancer (\"TNBC\") and SOC alone. The primary endpoint is the pathological complete response (\"pCR\") rate in the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes. The INVINCIBLE-4 Study is expected to enroll approximately 54 patients in Switzerland and France.\n\n  * September 2024: authorization from the Swiss Medic and the Swiss Ethics Commission to initiate the INVINCIBLE-4 Study.\n  * October 2024: first patient dosed in the INVINCIBLE-4 Study.\n\n\n\n\"This has been an excellent quarter of regulatory success in multiple countries. We received the regulatory authorizations needed to initiate sites in eight countries for our Phase 3 global sarcoma study and our Phase 2 breast cancer study in Switzerland,\" said Lewis H. Bender, Intensity Founder, President, and CEO. \"Our efforts now turn to site activation and patient recruitment. We remain committed to exploring our new treatment that causes immunological cell death in severe diseases such as soft tissue sarcoma and triple-negative breast cancer. We are excited that our drug will be tested in multiple countries on three continents. INT230-6's ability to debulk tumors and activate an immune response is now in late-stage testing for two indications. We expect that the results from these ongoing studies could potentially demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit for patients with high unmet need in both the metastatic and local disease settings.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to preliminary work related to the INVINCIBLE-3 Study, and to a lesser extent, increased expenses related to salary, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to salary, benefits and stock-based compensation, and higher directors and officers insurance.\n\nOverall, net loss was $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.8 million, which the Company expects will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter in 2025.\n\n**About INT230-6**\n\nINT230-6, Intensity's lead proprietary investigational product candidate, is designed for direct intratumoral injection. INT230-6 was discovered using Intensity's proprietary DfuseRx℠ technology platform. The drug is comprised of two proven, potent anti-cancer agents, cisplatin and vinblastine, and a penetration enhancer molecule (SHAO) that helps disperse potent cytotoxic drugs throughout tumors for diffusion into cancer cells. These agents remain in the tumor, resulting in a favorable safety profile. In addition to local disease control and direct tumor killing, INT230-6 causes a release of a bolus of neoantigens specific to the malignancy, leading to immune system engagement and systemic anti-tumor effects. Importantly, these effects are mediated without immunosuppression which often occurs with systemic chemotherapy.\n\n**About Intensity Therapeutics**\n\nIntensity is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company whose novel engineered chemistry enables aqueous cytotoxic-containing drug formulations to mix and saturate a tumor's dense, high-fat, pressurized environment following direct intratumoral injection. As a result of the saturation, Intensity's clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of INT230-6 to kill tumors and elicit an adaptive immune response within days of injection, representing a new approach to cancer cell death that holds the potential to shift the treatment paradigm and turn many deadly cancers into chronic diseases even for malignancies that do not respond to conventional immunotherapy. Intensity has completed two clinical studies and enrolled over 200 patients using INT230-6; a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study in metastatic cancers including sarcomas [(NCT03058289](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03058289 \"Opens in a new window\")), and a Phase 2 randomized control clinical trial in locally advanced breast cancer (the \"INVINCIBLE-2 Study\") ([NCT04781725](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04781725?term=INT230-6&rank=1 \"Opens in a new window\")) in women without undergoing chemotherapy prior to their surgery. The Company initiated a Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma (the \"INVINCIBLE-3 Study\") ([NCT06263231](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06263231?term=INT230-6&rank=3 \"Opens in a new window\")), testing INT230-6 as second or third line monotherapy compared to the standard of care (\"SOC\") with overall survival as an endpoint. Intensity also initiated a Phase 2 study in collaboration with The Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research SAKK (the \"INVINCIBLE-4 Study\") ([NCT06358573](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06358573?term=INT230-6&rank=4 \"Opens in a new window\")) as part of a Phase 2/3 program evaluating INT230-6 followed by the SOC immunochemotherapy and the SOC alone for patients with presurgical triple-negative breast cancer. Pathological complete response (\"pCR\") is the endpoint.

          "content": "November 13, 2024\nIntensity Therapeutics Reports Third\nQuarter 2024 Financial Results and\nProvides Corporate Update\nFirst patient dosed in randomized, Phase 2 study in presurgical triple negative breast cancer\nSHELTON, Conn., Nov. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Intensity Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Intensity\" or\n\"the Company\") (Nasdaq: INTS), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company focused on the\ndiscovery and development of proprietary, novel immune-based intratumoral cancer\ntherapies designed to kill tumors and increase immune system recognition of cancers,\nannounces third quarter 2024 financial results and provides a corporate update.\nCorporate Update\nINVINCIBLE-3 Study: a Phase 3 open-label, randomized study testing INT230-6 as\nmonotherapy compared to the SOC drugs in second and third line treatment for certain soft\ntissue sarcoma subtypes. The INVINCIBLE-3 Study is expected to enroll 333 patients and\ninitiate sites in eight countries. The primary endpoint in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study is overall\nsurvival.\nJuly 2024: the first patients were dosed in the U.S. in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study.\nJuly 2024: authorization received from Health Canada to initiate the INVINCIBLE-3\nStudy in Canada.\nSeptember 2024: authorization received from The European Medicines Agency to\ninitiate the INVINCIBLE-3 Study in Europe.\nOctober 2024: authorization received from Australia's Therapeutic Goods\nAdministration to initiate INVINCIBLE-3 Study in Australia.\nINVINCIBLE-4 Study: a Phase 2 randomized open-label, multicenter study to analyze the\nclinical activity, safety, and tolerability of INT230-6 given before administration of the\nstandard of care (\"SOC\") treatment in patients with early-stage, operable triple-negative\nbreast cancer (\"TNBC\") and SOC alone. The primary endpoint is the pathological complete\nresponse (\"pCR\") rate in the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes. The INVINCIBLE-4\nStudy is expected to enroll approximately 54 patients in Switzerland and France.\nSeptember 2024: authorization from the Swiss Medic and the Swiss Ethics\nCommission to initiate the INVINCIBLE-4 Study.\nOctober 2024: first patient dosed in the INVINCIBLE-4 Study.\n\"This has been an excellent quarter of regulatory success in multiple countries. We received\nthe regulatory authorizations needed to initiate sites in eight countries for our Phase 3 global\nsarcoma study and our Phase 2 breast cancer study in Switzerland,\" said Lewis H. Bender,\nIntensity Founder, President, and CEO. \"Our efforts now turn to site activation and patient\nrecruitment. We remain committed to exploring our new treatment that causes\nimmunological cell death in severe diseases such as soft tissue sarcoma and triple-negative\nbreast cancer. We are excited that our drug will be tested in multiple countries on three\ncontinents. INT230-6's ability to debulk tumors and activate an immune response is now in\nlate-stage testing for two indications. We expect that the results from these ongoing studies\ncould potentially demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit for patients with high unmet need\nin both the metastatic and local disease settings.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase\nwas primarily due to preliminary work related to the INVINCIBLE-3 Study, and to a lesser\nextent, increased expenses related to salary, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase\nwas primarily due to increased expenses related to salary, benefits and stock-based\ncompensation, and higher directors and officers insurance.\nOverall, net loss was $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to a net loss of $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.8 million, which the\nCompany expects will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter in 2025.\nAbout INT230-6\nINT230-6, Intensity's lead proprietary investigational product candidate, is designed for direct\nintratumoral injection. INT230-6 was discovered using Intensity's proprietary DfuseRx℠\ntechnology platform. The drug is comprised of two proven, potent anti-cancer agents,\ncisplatin and vinblastine, and a penetration enhancer molecule (SHAO) that helps disperse\npotent cytotoxic drugs throughout tumors for diffusion into cancer cells. These agents remain\nin the tumor, resulting in a favorable safety profile. In addition to local disease control and\ndirect tumor killing, INT230-6 causes a release of a bolus of neoantigens specific to the\nmalignancy, leading to immune system engagement and systemic anti-tumor effects.\nImportantly, these effects are mediated without immunosuppression which often occurs with\nsystemic chemotherapy.\nAbout Intensity Therapeutics\nIntensity is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company whose novel engineered chemistry\nenables aqueous cytotoxic-containing drug formulations to mix and saturate a tumor's dense,\nhigh-fat, pressurized environment following direct intratumoral injection. As a result of the\nsaturation, Intensity's clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of INT230-6 to kill tumors\nand elicit an adaptive immune response within days of injection, representing a new\napproach to cancer cell death that holds the potential to shift the treatment paradigm and\nturn many deadly cancers into chronic diseases even for malignancies that do not respond\nto conventional immunotherapy. Intensity has completed two clinical studies and enrolled\nover 200 patients using INT230-6; a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study in metastatic cancers\nincluding sarcomas (NCT03058289), and a Phase 2 randomized control clinical trial in locally\nadvanced breast cancer (the \"INVINCIBLE-2 Study\") (NCT04781725) in women without\nundergoing chemotherapy prior to their surgery. The Company initiated a Phase 3 trial in soft\ntissue sarcoma (the \"INVINCIBLE-3 Study\") (NCT06263231), testing INT230-6 as second or\nthird line monotherapy compared to the standard of care (\"SOC\") with overall survival as an\nendpoint. Intensity also initiated a Phase 2 study in collaboration with The Swiss Group for\nClinical Cancer Research SAKK (the \"INVINCIBLE-4 Study\") (NCT06358573) as part of a\nPhase 2/3 program evaluating INT230-6 followed by the SOC immunochemotherapy and the\nSOC alone for patients with presurgical triple-negative breast cancer. Pathological complete\nresponse (\"pCR\") is the endpoint.
