Operating pre-tax, pre-provision income (operating PTPP), a non-GAAP measure reconciled later in this release to the components of net income before taxes, the nearest comparable GAAP measure, was $154.6 million, or $3.15 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $146.8 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, for the linked quarter, and $126.6 million, or $2.60 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. These operating PTPP results represent increases of 5.3% on a linked-quarter basis and 22.1% compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\n“We are pleased with another quarter of solid financial performance across the board,” said Mariner Kemper, UMB Financial Corporation chairman and chief executive officer. “Strong institutional banking activity contributed to the 9.5% increase in fee income compared to the linked quarter, and near-double digit annualized loan growth drove net interest income higher. Net interest margin decreased five basis points sequentially due largely to the decline in average noninterest-bearing deposit balances driven by net client disbursements within our asset servicing and corporate trust lines of business, which can be episodic in nature. Asset quality remains strong as evidenced by only eight basis points of net charge-offs to average loans on a year-to-date basis; the higher provision expense in the quarter largely reflects the impact of $793.3 million in net loan growth that was driven by record top-line loan production of $1.4 billion. \n\n“We are on track to complete our pending acquisition of Heartland Financial, subject to regulatory and other approvals, in the first quarter of 2025. Our preparations for legal day one of the acquisition are well underway, with many cross-functional workstreams collaborating with personnel from Heartland Financial. This financially and strategically compelling combination will add further diversity and scale to our already well-diversified financial model. We look forward to serving our prospective clients and geographies as well as welcoming new associates to our UMB family.” \n\n(i)  | A non-GAAP financial measure reconciled later in this release to net income, the nearest comparable GAAP measure.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 earnings discussion**\n\n**Summary of quarterly financial results** |  **UMB Financial Corporation**  \n---|---  \n(unaudited, dollars in thousands, except per share data)   \n**Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (GAAP)  |  $  |  109,643  |  $  |  101,345  |  $  |  96,554   \nEarnings per share -

Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $600.9 million, or 5.9%, as compared to the linked quarter, driven by net cash disbursements within the asset servicing and other corporate trust lines of business. Compared to the linked quarter, average commercial demand deposit balances increased 2.8% during the quarter. \n  * Net interest margin for the third quarter was 2.46%, a decrease of five basis points from the linked quarter, driven by the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities due to mix shift in the funding composition, partially offset by increased loan yields and earning asset mix changes. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased three basis points to 4.18%. Total cost of funds increased 10 basis points from the linked quarter to 3.16%. Average loan yields increased two basis points while earning asset yields increased three basis points from the linked quarter. \n  * On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $25.1 million, or 11.3%, driven by a $1.6 billion, or 7.2%, increase in average loans, partially offset by higher interest costs due to unfavorable mix shift in the composition of liabilities as well as the impact of higher short-term interest rates. \n  * Compared to the third quarter of 2023, average earning assets increased $3.7 billion, or 9.8%, largely driven by an increase of $2.0 billion in interest-bearing due from banks and the increase in average loans noted above. \n  * Average deposits increased 12.6% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances decreased 5.1% compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by net cash disbursements within the commercial and institutional segments. Average demand deposit balances comprised 26.9% of total deposits, compared to 29.4% in the linked quarter and 32.0% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Average borrowed funds decreased $280.1 million as compared to the linked quarter and $1.1 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by short-term borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve. \n\n\n\n**Noninterest income**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 noninterest income increased $13.8 million, or 9.5%, on a linked-quarter basis, largely due to: \n    * $2.6 million in investment securities gains, primarily driven by increased valuations in the company's non-marketable securities compared to a $1.9 million loss in the linked quarter. \n    * Increases of $2.8 million in fund services income and $1.6 million in corporate trust income, both recorded in trust and securities processing. \n    * An increase of $2.7 million in company-owned life insurance and a gain of $1.1 million on the sale of a building during the third quarter of 2024, both recorded in other income. The increase in company-owned life insurance was offset by a proportionate increase in deferred compensation expense as noted below. \n    * Increases of $1.7 million in both brokerage income and trading and investment banking, primarily driven by higher 12b-1 fees and money market income and increased trading volume, respectively. \n    * These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in service charges on deposit accounts primarily due to lower healthcare income related to customer transfer and conversion. \n  * Compared to the prior year, noninterest income in the third quarter of 2024 increased $25.4 million, or 19.1%, primarily driven by: \n    * An increase of $7.7 million in other income, primarily driven by an increase of $4.0 million in company-owned life insurance income, a $1.1 million gain on the sale of a building during the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of $0.7 million in bank-owned life insurance income. The increase in company-owned life insurance was offset by a proportionate increase in deferred compensation expense as noted below. \n    * Increases of $5.2 million in fund services income, $1.8 million in corporate trust income, and $0.6 million in trust income, all recorded in trust and securities processing. \n    * Increases of $3.3 million in trading and investment banking, driven by higher trading volume and $3.1 million in bankcard income, driven by increased interchange income. \n    * Increases of $2.4 million in investment securities gains, primarily driven by increased valuations in the company's non-marketable securities and $2.3 million in brokerage income, driven by higher 12b-1 fees and money market income. \n\n\n\n**Noninterest expense**\n\n**Summary of noninterest expense** |  **UMB Financial Corporation**  \n---|---  \n(unaudited, dollars in thousands)   \n**Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **CQ vs.** |  **CQ vs.**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **LQ** |  **PY**  \nSalaries and employee benefits  |  $  |  146,984  |  $  |  142,861  |  $  |  133,380  |  $  |  4,123  |  $  |  13,604   \nOccupancy, net  |  12,274  |  11,723  |  12,283  |  551  |  (9  |  )   \nEquipment  |  15,988  |  15,603  |  17,204  |  385  |  (1,216  |  )   \nSupplies and services  |  4,967  |  3,404  |  3,213  |  1,563  |  1,754   \nMarketing and business development  |  6,817  |  6,598  |  6,631  |  219  |  186   \nProcessing fees  |  29,697  |  29,701  |  26,016  |  (4  |  )  |  3,681   \nLegal and consulting  |  9,518  |  16,566  |  7,230  |  (7,048  |  )  |  2,288   \nBankcard  |  12,482  |  11,818  |  8,852  |  664  |  3,630   \nAmortization of other intangible assets  |  1,917  |  1,911  |  2,124  |  6  |  (207  |  )   \nRegulatory fees  |  4,686  |  2,568  |  6,153  |  2,118  |  (1,467  |  )   \nOther  |  7,124  |  6,314  |  8,355  |  810  |  (1,231  |  )   \nTotal noninterest expense  |  $  |  252,454  |  $  |  249,067  |  $  |  231,441  |  $  |  3,387  |  $  |  21,013   \n  \n  * GAAP noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $252.5 million, an increase of $3.4 million, or 1.4%, from the linked quarter and an increase of $21.0 million, or 9.1% from the third quarter of 2023. Operating noninterest expense, a non-GAAP financial measure reconciled later in this release to noninterest expense, the nearest comparable GAAP measure, was $251.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $8.3 million, or 3.4%, from the linked quarter and an increase of $22.5 million, or 9.8%, from the third quarter of 2023. \n  * The linked-quarter increase in GAAP noninterest expense was driven by: \n    * An increase of $2.1 million in regulatory fees expense, driven primarily by changes in loss estimates related to the industry-wide FDIC special assessment levied on banks to recoup the losses related to two of the bank failures in March 2023. The results for the third quarter of 2024 include a reduction of $1.7 million in pre-tax FDIC special assessment expense while the second quarter included a reduction of $3.8 million. \n    * Increases of $1.9 million in deferred compensation expense, $1.9 million in salary and wage expense, and $1.3 million in bonus and commission expense, tied to improved company performance, all recorded in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in deferred compensation expense was offset by the increase in company-owned life insurance income noted above. \n    * Increases of $1.6 million in supplies driven by purchases of computers during the third quarter, $0.8 million in other expense, and $0.7 million in bankcard expense driven by higher administrative expense. \n    * These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $7.0 million in legal and consulting expense driven by expense related to the announced acquisition of Heartland Financial USA, Inc. during the linked quarter. \n  * The year-over-year increase in GAAP noninterest expense was driven by: \n    * Increases of $5.4 million in salary and wage expense, $3.6 million in bonus and commission expense tied to improved company performance, and $2.7 million in deferred compensation expense, all recorded in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in deferred compensation expense was offset by the increase in company-owned life insurance income noted above. \n    * Increases of $3.7 million in processing fees expense due to increased software subscription costs and $3.6 million in bankcard expense driven by higher administrative expense. \n    * Increases of $2.3 million in legal and consulting expense related to the announced acquisition of Heartland Financial USA, Inc. and $1.8 million in supplies driven by purchases of computers during the third quarter of 2024. \n    * These increases were partially offset by the following decreases: \n      * A decrease of $1.5 million in regulatory fees expense driven by the aforementioned reduction of $1.7 million in FDIC special assessment expense recorded in the third quarter of 2024. \n      * A decrease of $1.9 million in operational losses, recorded in other expense, driven by lower activity in the current period. \n\n\n\n**Income taxes**\n\n  * The company’s effective tax rate was 19.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.1% for the same period in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily attributable to a smaller portion of income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities and higher non-deductible acquisition costs in 2024. \n\n\n\n**Balance sheet**\n\n  * Average total assets for the third quarter of 2024 were $43.3 billion compared to $42.5 billion for the linked quarter and $39.5 billion for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Summary of average loans and leases - QTD Average** |  **UMB Financial Corporation**  \n---|---  \n(unaudited, dollars in thousands)   \n**Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **CQ vs.** |  **CQ vs.**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **LQ** |  **PY**  \nCommercial and industrial  |  $  |  10,176,502  |  $  |  9,926,855  |  $  |  9,852,335  |  $  |  249,647  |  $  |  324,167   \nSpecialty lending  |  508,957  |  502,646  |  526,711  |  6,311  |  (17,754  |  )   \nCommercial real estate  |  9,669,076  |  9,360,991  |  8,545,206  |  308,085  |  1,123,870   \nConsumer real estate  |  3,045,229  |  2,998,560  |  2,922,753  |  46,669  |  122,476   \nConsumer  |  164,105  |  159,743  |  139,384  |  4,362  |  24,721   \nCredit cards  |  613,663  |  617,502  |  477,904  |  (3,839  |  )  |  135,759   \nLeases and other  |  209,631  |  239,532  |  287,174  |  (29,901  |  )  |  (77,543  |  )   \nTotal loans  |  $  |  24,387,163  |  $  |  23,805,829  |  $  |  22,751,467  |  $  |  581,334  |  $  |  1,635,696   \n  \n  * Average loans for the third quarter of 2024 increased $581.3 million, or 2.4%, on a linked-quarter basis and $1.6 billion, or 7.2%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Summary of average securities - QTD Average** |  **UMB Financial Corporation**  \n---|---  \n(unaudited, dollars in thousands)   \n**Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **CQ vs.** |  **CQ vs.**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **LQ** |  **PY**  \nSecurities available for sale:   \nU.S. Treasury  |  $  |  821,308  |  $  |  900,348  |  $  |  786,136  |  $  |  (79,040  |  )  |  $  |  35,172   \nU.S. Agencies  |  166,250  |  210,151  |  172,832  |  (43,901  |  )  |  (6,582  |  )   \nMortgage-backed  |  3,888,879  |  3,667,289  |  3,611,305  |  221,590  |  277,574   \nState and political subdivisions  |  1,240,199  |  1,213,000  |  1,275,591  |  27,199  |  (35,392  |  )   \nCorporates  |  320,570  |  323,751  |  345,026  |  (3,181  |  )  |  (24,456  |  )   \nCollateralized loan obligations  |  340,604  |  336,273  |  346,426  |  4,331  |  (5,822  |  )   \nTotal securities available for sale  |  $  |  6,777,810  |  $  |  6,650,812  |  $  |  6,537,316  |  $  |  126,998  |  $  |  240,494   \nSecurities held to maturity:   \nU.S. Agencies  |  $  |  116,286  |  $  |  120,563  |  $  |  123,165  |  $  |  (4,277  |  )  |  $  |  (6,879  |  )   \nMortgage-backed  |  2,597,430  |  2,656,096  |  2,814,467  |  (58,666  |  )  |  (217,037  |  )   \nState and political subdivisions  |  2,785,138  |  2,798,371  |  2,828,029  |  (13,233  |  )  |  (42,891  |  )   \nTotal securities held to maturity  |  $  |  5,498,854  |  $  |  5,575,030  |  $  |  5,765,661  |  $  |  (76,176  |  )  |  $  |  (266,807  |  )   \nTrading securities  |  $  |  19,743  |  $  |  26,381  |  $  |  17,327  |  $  |  (6,638  |  )  |  $  |  2,416   \nOther securities  |  447,698  |  448,015  |  445,380  |  (317  |  )  |  2,318   \nTotal securities  |  $  |  12,744,105  |  $  |  12,700,238  |  $  |  12,765,684  |  $  |  43,867  |  $  |  (21,579  |  )   \n  \n  * Average total securities increased 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis and decreased 0.2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n  * At September 30, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the available-for-sale securities portfolio was $449.4 million, or 6.0% of the $7.5 billion amortized cost balance.

This information supplements the results that are reported according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results. The differences between the non-GAAP financial measures – net operating income, operating EPS, operating ROE, operating ROA, operating noninterest expense, operating efficiency ratio, operating PTPP, operating PTPP EPS, operating PTPP-FTE, operating PTPP-FTE EPS, tangible shareholders’ equity, and tangible book value per share – and the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures are reconciled later in this release. The company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations may be useful to investors because they adjust for acquisition- and severance-related items, and the FDIC special assessment that management does not believe reflect the company’s fundamental operating performance. \n\nNet operating income for the relevant period is defined as GAAP net income, adjusted to reflect the impact of excluding expenses related to acquisitions, severance expense, the FDIC special assessment, and the cumulative tax impact of these adjustments. \n\nOperating EPS (diluted) is calculated as earnings per share as reported, adjusted to reflect, on a per share basis, the impact of excluding the non-GAAP adjustments described above for the relevant period. Operating ROE is calculated as net operating income, divided by the company’s average total shareholders’ equity for the relevant period. Operating ROA is calculated as net operating income, divided by the company’s average assets for the relevant period. Operating noninterest expense for the relevant period is defined as GAAP noninterest expense, adjusted to reflect the pre-tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments described above. Operating efficiency ratio is calculated as the company’s operating noninterest expense, net of amortization of other intangibles, divided by the company’s total non-GAAP revenue (calculated as net interest income plus noninterest income, less gains on sales of securities available for sale, net). \n\nOperating PTPP income for the relevant period is defined as GAAP net interest income plus GAAP noninterest income, less noninterest expense, adjusted to reflect the impact of excluding expenses related to acquisitions and severance, and the FDIC special assessment. \n\nOperating PTPP-FTE for the relevant period is defined as GAAP net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis plus GAAP noninterest income, less noninterest expense, adjusted to reflect the impact of excluding expenses related to acquisitions and severance, and the FDIC special assessment. \n\nTangible shareholders’ equity for the relevant period is defined as GAAP shareholders’ equity, net of intangible assets. Tangible book value per share is defined as tangible shareholders’ equity divided by the Company’s total shares outstanding. \n\n** Forward-Looking Statements: **\n\nThis press release contains, and our other communications may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “target,” “trend,” “plan,” “goal,” or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” or “could.” Forward-looking statements convey our expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, results, or aspirations. All forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Our actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, condition, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement. Some of the factors that may cause actual results or other future events, circumstances, or aspirations to differ from those in forward-looking statements are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, or other applicable documents that are filed or furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to such factors that have been disclosed previously: macroeconomic and adverse developments and uncertainties related to the collateral effects of the collapse of, and challenges for, domestic and international banks, including the impacts to the U.S. and global economies; sustained levels of high inflation and the potential for an economic recession on the heels of aggressive quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve; and impacts related to or resulting from instability in the Middle East and Russia’s military action in Ukraine, such as the broader impacts to financial markets and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, may also cause actual results or other future events, circumstances, or aspirations to differ from our forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf speaks only as of the date that it was made. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of events, circumstances, or results that arise after the date that the statement was made, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. You, however, should consult further disclosures (including disclosures of a forward-looking nature) that we may make in any subsequent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K, or other applicable document that is filed or furnished with the SEC. \n\n** About UMB : **\n\nUMB Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: UMBF) is a financial services company headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri.

BUSINESS\nGeneral\nUMB Financial Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise, the Company) is a financial holding\ncompany that is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. The Company provides banking services and asset servicing to its customers in the United States and\naround the globe.\nThe Company was organized as a corporation under Missouri law in 1967 and is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA) and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended (the GLBA). The\nCompany currently owns all of the outstanding stock of one national bank and several nonbank subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s national bank, UMB Bank, National Association (the Bank), has its principal office in Missouri and also has branches in Arizona,\nColorado, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Bank offers a full complement of banking products and other services to commercial, retail,\ngovernment, and correspondent-bank customers, including a wide range of asset-management, trust, bankcard, and cash-management services.\nThe Company also owns UMB Fund Services, Inc. (UMBFS), which is a significant nonbank subsidiary that has offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,\nChadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Ogden, Utah. UMBFS provides fund accounting, transfer agency, and other services to mutual fund and alternative-investment\ngroups.\nPrior to March 31, 2021, the Company also owned Prairie Capital Management, LLC (PCM), which provided investment management services and\nalternative investments in hedge funds and private equity funds. The Company sold its membership interests in PCM during the first quarter of 2021.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company’s products and services are grouped into three segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and Personal Banking.\nThese segments and their financial results are described in detail in (i) the section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations entitled Business Segments, which can be found in Part II, Item 7 of this report and (ii) Note 12, “Business Segment Reporting,” in the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nCompetition\nThe Company faces intense competition in each of its business segments and in all of the markets and geographic regions that the Company serves.\nCompetition comes from both traditional and non-traditional financial-services providers, including banks, savings associations, finance companies, investment\nadvisors, asset managers, mutual funds, private-equity firms, hedge funds, brokerage firms, mortgage-banking companies, credit-card companies, insurance\ncompanies, trust companies, securities processing companies, and credit unions. Increasingly, financial-technology (fintech) companies are partnering with\nfinancial-services providers to compete with the Company for lending, payments, and other business. Many of the Company’s competitors are not subject to the\nsame kind or degree of supervision and regulation as the Company.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors. Banking customers are generally influenced by convenience, interest rates and pricing, personal\nexperience, quality and availability of products and other services, lending limits, transaction execution, and reputation. Investment advisory services compete\nprimarily on returns, expenses, third-party ratings, and the reputation and performance of managers. Asset servicing competes primarily on price, quality of\nservices, and reputation. The Company and its competitors are all impacted to varying degrees by the overall economy and health of the financial markets.\nThe Company’s ability to successfully compete in its chosen markets and regions also depends on its ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented\nemployees, to invest in technology and infrastructure, and to innovate, all while effectively managing its expenses. The Company expects that competition will\nlikely intensify in the future.\n4\nHuman Capital\nThe Company is dedicated to creating the Unparalleled Customer Experience, and its associates are critical to achieving this mission. As part of the\nCompany’s efforts to recruit and retain top talent, it strives to offer competitive compensation and benefits programs, while fostering a culture rooted in\ninclusion of a diverse mix of associates who are empowered to be part of something more. The Company believes its associates, customers, and communities\nmutually benefit by its focus on providing opportunities for its associates to make an impact at work and in their respective communities. On a full-time\nequivalent basis at December 31, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 3,599 associates across the country.\nCompensation and Benefits Program. The Company’s compensation program is designed to allow it to attract, reward, and retain talented individuals\nwho contribute significant value to the organization. The Company’s compensation programs reward performance, reserving the highest rewards for the highest\nperformers. The Company’s incentive plans are intended to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by providing associates with incentives\nand rewards to encourage them to continue in service of the Company. The Company provides employees with compensation packages that include base salary,\nannual short-term incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards tied to management, growth, and protection of the business of the Company. In addition to\ncash and equity compensation, the Company offers a robust benefits program that includes medical, dental, and vision insurance, health savings accounts and a\nvariety of insurance options, including pet, life, and long-term care. Additionally, the Company also offers associates benefits including paid time off, paid\nvolunteer time off, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, a 401(k) plan, as well as profit sharing and an employee stock ownership plan. The Company strives\nto engage and encourage associates to act and take personal responsibility for improving their health and well-being, as well as the health and well-being of their\nfamilies. To assist associates with their goals, the Company offers wellness resources and incentives to support wellness strategies.\nDiversity and Inclusion. The Company believes that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results\nin better products and services, and is crucial to its efforts to attract and retain key talent. The Company’s talent acquisition team focuses on building recruitment\nmarketing strategies that are designed to identify and attract diverse candidates. The Company’s business resource groups (BRGs) also play a vital role in\ndeepening the recruitment pipeline of diverse talent and refer candidates to the Company on a regular basis. BRGs are structured to engage associates who\nshare common interests, including associates from traditionally underrepresented groups. Nearly 20% of the Company’s associates participate in one or more\nBRGs.\nCommunity Involvement. For more than a century, the Company has maintained a commitment to the prosperity of each community it serves. In addition\nto providing financial products built for the needs of its customers, the Company builds strong community partnerships through associate volunteerism,\nassociate financial giving, and corporate philanthropy. The Company encourages associates to give back to their local communities through various programs\nand initiatives, including paid volunteer time off and matching charitable gift programs.\nFor more information on the Company’s diversity and inclusion and community involvement initiatives, please see its Corporate Citizenship Report\navailable at www.umb.com/corporatecitizenship. Information on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference into this report and should not be\nconsidered part of this document.\nGovernment Monetary and Fiscal Policies\nIn addition to the impact of general economic conditions, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital, liquidity, and\nprospects are significantly affected by government monetary and fiscal policies that are announced or implemented in the United States and abroad.\nA sizeable influence is exerted, in particular, by the policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB), which influences\nmonetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Among the FRB’s\npolicy tools are (1) open market operations (that is, purchases or sales of securities in the open market to adjust the supply of reserve balances in order to\nachieve targeted federal funds rates or to put pressure on longer-term interest rates in order to achieve more desirable levels of economic activity and job\ncreation), (2) the discount rate charged on loans by the Federal Reserve Banks, (3) the level of reserves required to be held by depository institutions against\nspecified deposit liabilities, (4) the interest paid or charged on balances maintained with the Federal Reserve Banks by depository institutions, including\nbalances used to satisfy their reserve requirements, and (5) other deposit and loan facilities.\n5\nThe FRB and its policies have a substantial impact on the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates, and other aspects of pricing for loans\nand deposits, and the conditions in equity, fixed income, currency, and other markets in which the Company operates. Policies announced or implemented by\nother central banks around the world have a meaningful effect as well and sometimes may be coordinated with those of the FRB.\nTax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how the\nCompany and its customers prioritize objectives, operate businesses, and deploy resources.\nRegulation and Supervision\nThe Company is subject to regulatory frameworks in the United States at federal, State, and local levels. In addition, the Company is subject to the direct\nsupervision of various government authorities charged with overseeing the kinds of financial activities conducted by its business segments.\nThis section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations that apply to the Company. The descriptions, however, are not complete\nand are qualified in their entirety by the full text and judicial or administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations and other laws and regulations that\naffect the Company.\nOverview\nThe Company is a bank holding company under the BHCA and a financial holding company under the GLBA. As a result, the Company—including all\nof its businesses and operations—is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the FRB and to restrictions on permissible activities. This\nframework of regulation, supervision, and examination is intended primarily for the protection and benefit of depositors and other customers of the Bank, the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC), the banking and financial systems as a whole, and the broader\neconomy, not for the protection or benefit of the Company’s shareholders or its non-deposit creditors.\nMany of the Company’s subsidiaries are also subject to separate or related forms of regulation, supervision, and examination, including: (1) the Bank, by\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) under the National Banking Acts, the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA), and\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act); (2)\nUMBFS, UMB Distribution Services, LLC, and UMB Financial Services, Inc., by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and State regulatory\nauthorities under federal and State securities laws, and UMB Distribution Services, LLC and UMB Financial Services, Inc., by the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (FINRA); and (3) UMB Insurance, Inc., by State regulatory authorities under applicable State insurance laws. These regulatory schemes,\nlike those overseen by the FRB, are designed to protect public or private interests that often are not aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders or non-\ndeposit creditors.\nThe FRB possesses extensive authorities and powers to regulate the conduct of the Company’s businesses and operations. If the FRB were to take the\nposition that the Company or any of its subsidiaries have violated any law or commitment or engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice, formal or informal\ncorrective or enforcement actions could be taken by the FRB against the Company, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties (such as directors, officers,\nand agents). These enforcement actions could include an imposition of civil monetary penalties and could directly affect not only the Company, its subsidiaries,\nand institution-affiliated parties but also the Company’s counterparties, shareholders, and creditors and its commitments, arrangements, or other dealings with\nthem. The OCC has similarly expansive authorities and powers over the Bank and its subsidiaries, as does the CFPB over matters involving consumer financial\nlaws. The SEC, FINRA, and other domestic or foreign government authorities also have an array of means at their disposal to regulate and enforce matters\nwithin their jurisdiction that could impact the Company’s businesses and operations.\nRestrictions on Permissible Activities and Corporate Matters\nUnder the BHCA, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and to closely related activities that are\nincidental to banking.\nAs a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the GLBA, the Company is also able—directly or indirectly\nthrough its subsidiaries—to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to a financial activity, or that are complementary to a financial\nactivity and do not pose a\n6\nsubstantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Activities that are financial in nature include: (1)\nunderwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities, (2) providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, (3) underwriting insurance, and\n(4) merchant banking.\nThe Company’s ability to directly or indirectly engage in these banking and financial activities, however, is subject to conditions and other limits\nimposed by law or the FRB and, in some cases, requires the approval of the FRB or other government authorities. These conditions or other limits may arise due\nto the particular type of activity or, in other cases, may apply to the Company’s business more generally. Examples of the former are the substantial restrictions\non the timing, amount, form, substance, interconnectedness, and management of the Company’s merchant banking investments. An example of the latter is a\ncondition that, in order for the Company to engage in broader financial activities, its depository institutions must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed”\nunder applicable banking laws and must receive at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).\nUnder amendments to the BHCA promulgated by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 and the Dodd-Frank Act, the\nCompany may acquire banks outside of its home State of Missouri, subject to specified limits and may establish new branches in other States to the same extent\nas banks chartered in those States. Under the BHCA, however, the Company must procure the prior approval of the FRB and possibly other government\nauthorities to directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of five percent or more of any class of voting securities of, or substantially all of the assets of,\nan unaffiliated bank, savings association, or bank holding company. In deciding whether to approve any acquisition or branch, the FRB, the OCC, and other\ngovernment authorities will consider public or private interests that may not be aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders or non-deposit creditors. The\nFRB also has the power to require the Company to divest any depository institution that cannot maintain its “well capitalized” or “well managed” status.\nThe FRB maintains a targeted policy that requires a bank holding company to inform and consult with the staff of the FRB sufficiently in advance of (1)\ndeclaring and paying a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns (for example, a dividend that exceeds earnings in the period for which the\ndividend is being paid), (2) redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses, or (3)\nredeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of the quarter in the amount of those\nequity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.\nRequirements Affecting the Relationships among the Company, Its Subsidiaries, and Other Affiliates\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, UMBFS, and its other subsidiaries but receives the vast majority of its revenue in the\nform of dividends from those subsidiaries. Without the approval of the OCC, however, dividends payable by the Bank in any calendar year may not exceed the\nlesser of (1) the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years and (2) undivided profits. In addition, under the\nBasel III capital-adequacy standards described below under the heading “Capital-Adequacy Standards,” the Bank is currently required to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer in excess of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and will be restricted in declaring and paying dividends whenever the buffer is breached.\nThe authorities and powers of the FRB, the OCC, and other government authorities to prevent any unsafe or unsound practice also could be employed to further\nlimit the dividends that the Bank or the Company’s other subsidiaries may declare and pay to the Company.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires a bank holding company like the Company to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository-institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries in circumstances when the Company might not otherwise elect to do so. The functional\nregulator of any nonbank subsidiary of the Company, however, may prevent that subsidiary from directly or indirectly contributing its financial support, and if\nthat were to preclude the Company from serving as an adequate source of financial strength, the FRB may instead require the divestiture of depository-\ninstitution subsidiaries and impose operating restrictions pending such a divestiture.\nA number of laws, principally Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the FRA), and the FRB’s Regulation W, also exist to prevent the\nCompany and its nonbank subsidiaries from taking improper advantage of the benefits afforded to the Bank as a depository institution, including its access to\nfederal deposit insurance and the discount window. These laws generally require the Bank and its subsidiaries to deal with the Company and its nonbank\nsubsidiaries only on market terms and, in addition, impose restrictions on the Bank and its subsidiaries in\n7\ndirectly or indirectly extending credit to or engaging in other covered transactions with the Company or its nonbank subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act extended\nthe restrictions to derivatives and securities lending transactions and expanded the restrictions for transactions involving hedge funds or private-equity funds that\nare owned or sponsored by the Company or its nonbank subsidiaries.\nIn addition, under the Volcker Rule, the Company is subject to extensive limits on proprietary trading and on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and\nprivate-equity funds. The limits on proprietary trading are largely directed toward purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal\nprimarily for the purpose of short-term resale, a benefit from actual or expected short-term price movements, or the realization of short-term arbitrage profits.\nThe limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in\nmanaged or advised funds and are not exposed to significant losses arising directly or indirectly from them. The Volcker Rule also provides for increased capital\ncharges, quantitative limits, rigorous compliance programs, and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities, including a prohibition on\ntransactions with a covered fund that would constitute a covered transaction under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA.\nStress Testing and Enhanced Prudential Standards\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) was enacted in May 2018, amending requirements previously\nestablished in the Dodd-Frank Act, including stress testing and enhanced prudential standards. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion,\nincluding the Company, are no longer subject to the requirement to conduct forward-looking, company-run stress testing, including publishing a summary of\nresults. The Company continues to run internal stress tests as a component of its comprehensive risk management and capital planning process. In addition, the\nEGRRCPA increased the statutory asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250\nbillion (subject to certain discretion by the Federal Reserve to apply any enhanced prudential standard requirement to any bank holding company with between\n$100 billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets that would otherwise be exempt under EGRRCPA). The Company remains exempt from applying the\nenhanced prudential standards.\nCapital-Adequacy Standards\nThe FRB and the OCC have adopted risk-based capital and leverage guidelines that require the capital-to-assets ratios of bank holding companies and\nnational banks, respectively, to meet specified minimum standards.\nThe risk-based capital ratios are based on a banking organization’s risk-weighted asset amounts (RWAs), which are generally determined under the\nstandardized approach applicable to the Company and the Bank by (1) assigning on-balance-sheet exposures to broad risk-weight categories according to the\ncounterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or collateral (with higher risk weights assigned to categories of exposures perceived as representing greater risk) and\n(2) multiplying off-balance-sheet exposures by specified credit conversion factors to calculate credit equivalent amounts and assigning those credit equivalent\namounts to the relevant risk-weight categories. The leverage ratio, in contrast, is based on an institution’s average on-balance-sheet exposures alone.\nThe capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of December 31, 2023, are set forth below:\nTier 1 Common Total\nTier 1 Risk-Based Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based\nLeverage Ratio Capital Ratio Capital Ratio Capital Ratio\nUMB Financial Corporation 8.49 10.94 10.94 12.85\nUMB Bank, n.a. 8.52 11.21 11.21 11.90\nThese capital-to-assets ratios also play a central role in prompt corrective action (PCA), which is an enforcement framework used by the federal banking\nagencies to constrain the activities of banking organizations based on their levels of regulatory capital. Five categories have been established using thresholds\nfor the total risk-based capital ratio, the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the common-equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio: (1) well\ncapitalized, (2) adequately capitalized, (3) undercapitalized, (4) significantly undercapitalized, and (5) critically undercapitalized. While bank holding\ncompanies are not subject to the PCA framework, the FRB is empowered to compel a holding company to take measures—such as the execution of financial or\nperformance guarantees—when prompt corrective action is required in connection with one of its depository-institution subsidiaries. At December 31, 2023, the\nBank was categorized as well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n8\nBasel III, including revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), includes a number of more rigorous provisions\napplicable only to banking organizations that are larger or more internationally active than the Company and the Bank. These include, for example, a\nsupplementary leverage ratio incorporating off-balance-sheet exposures, a liquidity coverage ratio, and a net stable funding ratio. These standards may be\ninformally applied or considered by the FRB and the OCC in their regulation, supervision, and examination of the Company and the Bank.\nDeposit Insurance and Related Matters\nThe deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC in the standard insurance amount of $250 thousand per depositor for each account ownership category.\nThis insurance is funded through assessments on the Bank and other insured depository institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each institution’s assessment\nbase is determined based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, and there is a scorecard method for calculating assessments that\ncombines CAMELS (an acronym that refers to the five components of a bank’s condition that are addressed: capital adequacy, asset quality, management,\nearnings, and liquidity) ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures to determine each institution’s risk to the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act also\nrequires the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of increasing its reserve for the DIF on institutions with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.\nThe result of this revised approach to deposit-insurance assessments is generally an increase in costs, on an absolute or relative basis, for institutions with\nconsolidated assets of $10 billion or more.\nIf an insured depository institution such as the Bank were to become insolvent or if other specified events were to occur relating to its financial condition\nor the propriety of its actions, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver for the institution. In that capacity, the FDIC would have the power to (1)\ntransfer assets and liabilities of the institution to another person or entity without the approval of the institution’s creditors, (2) require that its claims process be\nfollowed and to enforce statutory or other limits on damages claimed by the institution’s creditors, (3) enforce the institution’s contracts or leases according to\ntheir terms, (4) repudiate or disaffirm the institution’s contracts or leases, (5) seek to reclaim, recover, or recharacterize transfers of the institution’s assets or to\nexercise control over assets in which the institution may claim an interest, (6) enforce statutory or other injunctions, and (7) exercise a wide range of other\nrights, powers, and authorities, including those that could impair the rights and interests of all or some of the institution’s creditors. In addition, the\nadministrative expenses of the conservator or receiver could be afforded priority over all or some of the claims of the institution’s creditors, and under the FDIA,\nthe claims of depositors (including the FDIC as subrogee of depositors) would enjoy priority over the claims of the institution’s unsecured creditors.\nThe FDIA also provides that an insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in\nconnection with another commonly controlled insured depository institution that is in default or in danger of default. This cross-guarantee liability is generally\nsuperior in right of payment to claims of the institution’s holding company and its affiliates.\nOther Regulatory and Supervisory Matters\nAs a public company, the Company is subject to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and other federal and State securities laws. In addition, because the Company’s common stock is\nlisted with The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ), the Company is subject to the listing rules of that exchange.\nThe Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and related\nlaws require all financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism. These laws include a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as currency and suspicious\nactivity reporting) as well as know-your-customer and due-diligence rules.\nUnder the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its local communities—including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods—consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA does not create specific lending programs but does establish the\nframework and criteria by which the OCC regularly assesses the Bank’s record in meeting these credit needs. The Bank’s ratings under the CRA are taken into\naccount by the FRB and the OCC when considering merger or other specified applications that the Company or the Bank may submit from time to time.\n9\nThe Bank is subject as well to a vast array of consumer-protection laws, such as qualified-mortgage and other mortgage-related rules under the\njurisdiction of the CFPB. Lending limits, restrictions on tying arrangements, limits on permissible interest-rate charges, and other laws governing the conduct of\nbanking or fiduciary activities are also applicable to the Bank. In addition, the GLBA imposes on the Company and its subsidiaries a number of obligations\nrelating to financial privacy.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant.

These reports can also be found on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFinancial-services companies routinely encounter and address risks and uncertainties. In the following paragraphs, the Company describes some of the\nprincipal risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects\nor the value of or return on an investment in the Company. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only ones faced by the\n11\nCompany. Other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company that it has failed to identify, or that it currently considers immaterial may\nadversely affect the Company as well. Except where otherwise noted, the risk factors address risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company as well as its\nsubsidiaries. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(which can be found in Part II, Item 7 of this report) and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (which can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this\nreport).\nThe levels of, or changes in, interest rates could affect the Company’s business or performance. The Company’s business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and\ninvestments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market interest rates, which in turn are influenced\nby monetary and fiscal policies, general economic conditions, the regulatory environment, competitive pressures, and expectations about future changes in\ninterest rates. The policies and regulations of the federal government, in general, and the FRB, in particular, have a substantial impact on market interest rates.\nSee “Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which is incorporated by reference herein. Additionally, the Company has a\nsignificant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR is to be transitioned to alternative rates. The\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York represents the best alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The Company\ndiscontinued entering into new LIBOR-indexed financial instruments effective December 31, 2021. The majority of existing LIBOR-indexed contracts will\nrevert to SOFR. The remainder will be individually negotiated to a mutual preferred replacement index. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated\ndifferently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. Although the Company is currently unable to assess what\nthe ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of interest rate changes on the Company’s funding costs may differ from some peers given the Company’s concentration of funding from\ncommercial and institutional sources. These deposits, which often include the benefit of other ancillary revenues, are generally more price-sensitive than\nconsumer funding sources. In a rising rate environment, the Company may experience a sharper decline in low-cost funding sources or an increase in cost of\ndeposits due to its customer profile. However, the expectation of higher earning asset growth and the benefit of higher interest rates on our earning assets may\nhelp mitigate any impact.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by policies, regulations, or events that have the effect of altering the difference between long-term and short-\nterm interest rates (commonly known as the yield curve), depressing the interest rates associated with its earning assets to levels near the rates associated with\nits interest expense, or changing the spreads among different interest-rate indices. In addition, a rapid change in interest rates could result in interest expense\nincreasing faster than interest income because of differences in the maturities of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Further, if laws impacting taxation and\ninterest rates materially change, or if new laws are enacted, certain of the Company’s services and products, including municipal bonds, may be subject to less\nfavorable tax treatment or otherwise adversely impacted. The level of and changes in market interest rates—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are\nbeyond the Company’s control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while the highly\naccommodative monetary policy currently adopted by the FRB may benefit the Company to some degree by spurring economic activity among its customers,\nsuch a policy may ultimately cause the Company more harm by inhibiting its ability to grow or sustain net interest income.\nThe Company’s customers and counterparties also may be negatively impacted by the levels of, or changes in, interest rates, which could increase the\nrisk of delinquency or default on obligations to the Company. The levels of, or changes in, interest rates, moreover, may have an adverse effect on the value of\nthe Company’s investment portfolio, which includes long-term municipal bonds with fixed interest rates, and other financial instruments, the return on or\ndemand for loans, the prepayment speed of loans (including, without limitation, the pace of pay-downs expected or forecasted for commercial real estate and\nconstruction loans), the cost or availability of deposits or other funding sources, or the purchase or sale of investment securities.\nSee “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report for a discussion of how the\nCompany monitors and manages interest-rate risk.\n12\nWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, geopolitical events, more liberal origination or underwriting standards, or financial or systemic\nshocks could increase the Company’s credit risk and adversely affect its lending or other banking businesses and the value of its loans or investment\nsecurities. The Company’s business and results of operations depend significantly on general economic conditions. When those conditions are weak or\ndeteriorating in any of the markets or regions where the Company operates, or there are impacts stemming from geopolitical events, its business or performance\ncould be adversely affected. The Company’s lending and other banking businesses, in particular, are susceptible to weak or deteriorating economic conditions,\nwhich could result in reduced loan demand or utilization rates and at the same time increased delinquencies or defaults. These kinds of conditions also could\ndampen the demand for products and other services in the Company’s investment-management, asset-servicing, insurance, brokerage, or related businesses.\nFinancial markets and global supply chains may be adversely affected by the impact of military conflict, including the current conflicts in Ukraine and Israel,\nterrorism or other geopolitical events. Increased delinquencies or defaults could result as well from the Company adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other\nreasons—more liberal origination or underwriting standards for extensions of credit or other dealings with its customers or counterparties. If delinquencies or\ndefaults on the Company’s loans or investment securities increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and the Company\ncould incur administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on its claims and any collateral. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively\nimpact the market value and liquidity of the Company’s investment securities, and the Company may be required to record additional impairment charges if\ninvestment securities suffer a decline in value that is determined to have resulted from a credit loss. In addition, to the extent that loan charge-offs exceed\nestimates, an increase to the amount of provision expense related to the allowance for credit losses would reduce the Company’s income. See “Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Credit Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7A of this report for a discussion of how the Company monitors and\nmanages credit risk. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact the\nCompany, possibly to a severe degree, due to its role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.\nA meaningful part of the Company’s loan portfolio is secured by real estate and, as a result, could be negatively impacted by deteriorating or\nvolatile real estate markets, the economic environment or associated environmental liabilities. At December 31, 2023, 51.2% of the Company’s aggregate\nloan portfolio—comprised of commercial real estate loans (representing 38.4% of the aggregate loan portfolio) and consumer real estate loans (representing\n12.8% of the aggregate loan portfolio)—was primarily secured by interests in real estate located in the States where the Company operates. Other credit\nextended by the Company may be secured in part by real estate as well. Real estate values in the markets where this collateral is located may be different from,\nand in some instances worse than, real estate values in other markets or in the United States as a whole and may be affected by general economic conditions and\na variety of other factors outside of the control of the Company or its customers. Any deterioration or volatility in these real estate markets could result in\nincreased delinquencies or defaults, could adversely affect the value of the loans and the income to be derived from them, could give rise to unreimbursed\nrecovery costs, and could reduce the demand for new or additional credit and related banking products and other services, all to the detriment of the Company’s\nbusiness and performance. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic and other disruptions resulting from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Repayment of commercial real estate, which typically involves higher loan principal amounts as compared to consumer real estate\nlending, is often dependent on the successful operation of the business conducted on the property securing the loans. Negative shifts in economic conditions can\nimpact the borrower’s ability to pay. Failures in the Company’s risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect its ability to manage\nthis portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which could negatively impact\nthe Company’s operating and financial performance. In addition, if hazardous or toxic substances were found on any real estate that the Company acquires in\nforeclosure or otherwise, the Company may incur substantial liability for compliance and remediation costs, personal injury, or property damage.\nChallenging business, economic, or market conditions could adversely affect the Company’s fee-based banking, investment-management, asset-\nservicing, or other businesses. The Company’s fee-based banking, investment-management, asset-servicing, and other businesses are driven by wealth creation\nin the economy, robust market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. Economic downturns, market\ndisruptions, high unemployment or underemployment, unsustainable debt levels, depressed real estate markets, industry consolidations, or other challenging\nbusiness, economic, or market conditions could adversely affect these businesses and their results. If the funds or other groups that are clients of UMBFS were\nto encounter similar difficulties, UMBFS’s revenue could suffer. The Company’s bank-card revenue is driven\n13\nprimarily by transaction volumes in business, healthcare, and consumer spending that generate interchange fees, and any of these conditions could dampen those\nvolumes. Other fee-based banking businesses that could be adversely affected include trading, asset management, custody, trust, and cash and treasury\nmanagement.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company and its business or performance could be adversely affected by constraints in, or increased costs for,\nfunding. The Company defines liquidity as the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable\nlosses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term\nloans or other extensions of credit. The Company, like other financial-services companies, relies to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as\ndeposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct its business. A number of factors beyond the Company’s control, however, could have a detrimental\nimpact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on its liquidity. These factors include market disruptions, changes in its credit ratings or the sentiment\nof its investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, declines in the value of its investment securities, the loss of substantial\ndeposits or customer relationships, financial or systemic shocks, significant counterparty failures, and reputational damage. Unexpected declines or limits on the\ndividends declared and paid by the Company’s subsidiaries also could adversely affect its liquidity position. While the Company’s policies and controls are\ndesigned to ensure that it maintains adequate liquidity to conduct its business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment, there can be no assurance\nthat its liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, the Company may be required to sell assets at a loss in order to continue its\noperations. This could damage the performance and value of its business, prompt regulatory intervention, and harm its reputation, and if the condition were to\npersist for any appreciable period of time, its viability as a going concern could be threatened. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n—Liquidity Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report for a discussion of how the Company monitors and manages liquidity risk.\nThe Company’s investment-management and asset-servicing businesses could be negatively impacted by declines in assets under management\nor administration or by shifts in the mix of assets under management or administration. The revenues of the Company’s investment-management\nbusinesses are highly dependent on advisory fee income. These businesses generally earn higher fees on equity-based or alternative investments and strategies\nand lower fees on fixed income investments and strategies. Advisory-fee income may be negatively impacted by an absolute decline in assets under\nmanagement or by a shift in the mix of assets under management from equities or alternatives to fixed income. Such a decline or shift could be caused or\ninfluenced by any number of factors, such as underperformance in absolute or relative terms, loss of key advisers or other talent, changes in investing\npreferences or trends, market downturns or volatility, drops in investor confidence, reputational damage, increased competition, or general economic conditions.\nAny of these factors also could affect clients of UMBFS, and if this were to cause a decline in assets under administration at UMBFS or an adverse shift in the\nmix of those assets, the performance of UMBFS could suffer.\nTo the extent that the Company continues to maintain a sizeable portfolio of investment securities, its income may be adversely affected and its\nreported equity more volatile. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s securities portfolio totaled approximately $13.3 billion, which represented\napproximately 30.1% of its total assets. Regulatory restrictions and the Company’s investment policies generally result in the acquisition of securities with\nlower yields than loans. For the year-ended December 31, 2023, the weighted average yield of the Company’s securities portfolio was 2.66% as compared to\n6.27% for its loan portfolio. Accordingly, to the extent that the Company is unable to effectively deploy its funds to originate or acquire loans or other assets\nwith higher yields than those of its investment securities, the Company’s income may be negatively impacted. Additionally, approximately $7.1 billion, or\n53.3%, of the Company’s investment securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on these securities are\nexcluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which in turn affects the Company’s reported equity. As a result, to the extent that the\nCompany continues to maintain a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities, its reported equity may experience greater volatility.\nCyber incidents and other security breaches at the Company, at the Company’s service providers or counterparties, or in the business\ncommunity or markets may negatively impact the Company’s business or performance. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company collects,\nstores, and transmits sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including intellectual property, business information, funds-transfer\ninstructions, and the personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this\ninformation is critical to the Company’s operations and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, held\nhostage or\n14\nstolen or if the Company’s operations were disrupted, the Company could suffer significant financial, business, reputational, regulatory, or other damage. For\nexample, despite security measures, the Company’s information technology and infrastructure may be breached or rendered inaccessible through cyber-attacks,\nransomware and other computer viruses or malware, pretext calls, electronic phishing, or other means. These risks and uncertainties are rapidly evolving and\nincreasing in complexity, and the Company’s failure to effectively mitigate them could negatively impact its business and operations.\nRisks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and\nsophistication of these threats and the expanding use of technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers. The Company can provide\nno assurances that the safeguards it has in place or may implement in the future will prevent all unauthorized infiltrations or breaches and that the Company will\nnot suffer losses related to a security breach in the future, which losses may be material.\nService providers and counterparties also present a source of risk to the Company if their own security measures or other systems or infrastructure were\nto be breached, rendered inaccessible, or otherwise fail. Likewise, a cyber-attack or other security breach affecting the business community, the markets, or parts\nof them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and adversely affect the Company or its service providers or counterparties. Many of these risks and\nuncertainties are beyond the Company’s control.\nEven when an attempted cyber incident or other security breach is successfully avoided or thwarted, the Company may need to expend substantial\nresources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage.\nIf a breach were to occur, moreover, the Company could be exposed to contractual claims, regulatory actions, and litigation by private plaintiffs, and would\nadditionally suffer reputational harm. Despite the Company’s efforts to safeguard the integrity of systems and controls and to manage third-party risk, the\nCompany may not be able to anticipate or implement effective measures to prevent all security breaches or all risks to the sensitive, confidential, or proprietary\ninformation that it or its service providers or counterparties collect, store, or transmit.\nThe trading volume in the Company’s common stock at times may be low, which could adversely affect liquidity and stock price. Although the\nCompany’s common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume in the stock may at times be low and, in relative\nterms, less than that of other financial-services companies. A public trading market that is deep, liquid, and orderly depends on the presence in the marketplace\nof a large number of willing buyers and sellers and narrow bid-ask spreads. These market features, in turn, depend on a number of factors, such as the\nindividual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions, over which the Company has no control. During any period of lower trading\nvolume in the Company’s common stock, the stock price could be more volatile, and the liquidity of the stock could suffer.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and its business or performance could be adversely affected by the legal, regulatory and\nsupervisory frameworks applicable to it, changes in those frameworks, and other legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties. The Company is subject\nto expansive legal and regulatory frameworks in the United States—at the federal, State, and local levels—and in the foreign jurisdictions where its business\nsegments operate. In addition, the Company is subject to the direct supervision of government authorities charged with overseeing the taxation of domestic\ncompanies and the kinds of financial activities conducted by the Company in its business segments. These legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks are\noften designed to protect public or private interests that differ from the interests of the Company’s shareholders or non-deposit creditors. See “Government\nMonetary and Fiscal Policies” and “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which is incorporated by reference herein. The Company\nbelieves that government scrutiny of all financial-services companies has increased, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other\nlaws that govern financial services (with the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III being two of the more prominent examples), and a host of related business practices\nhave been reexamined and reshaped. As a result, the Company expects to continue devoting increased time and resources to risk management, compliance, and\nregulatory change management. Risks also exist that government authorities could judge the Company’s business or other practices as unsafe, unsound, or\notherwise unadvisable and bring formal or informal corrective or enforcement actions against it, including fines or other penalties and directives to change its\nproducts or other services. For practical or other reasons, the Company may not be able to effectively defend itself against these actions, and they in turn could\ngive rise to litigation by private plaintiffs. Further, if the laws, rules, and regulations materially adversely affect the Company, including any changes that would\nnegatively impact the tax treatment of the Company, the Company’s products and services or the Company’s shareholders, the Company may be adversely\nimpacted. All of\n15\nthese and other regulatory risks and uncertainties could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, or\nprospects.\nRegulatory or supervisory requirements, future growth, operating results, or strategic plans may prompt the Company to raise additional\ncapital, but that capital may not be available at all or on favorable terms and, if raised, may be dilutive. The Company is subject to safety-and-soundness\nand capital-adequacy standards under applicable law and to the direct supervision of government authorities. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1\nof this report. If the Company is not or is at risk of not satisfying these standards or applicable supervisory requirements—whether due to inadequate operating\nresults that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, or otherwise—the Company may be required to raise capital,\nrestrict dividends, or limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans. If the Company is required to limit originations of certain types of\ncommercial and mortgage loans, it would thereby reduce the amount of credit available to borrowers and limit opportunities to earn interest income from the\nloan portfolio. The Company also may be compelled to raise capital if regulatory or supervisory requirements change. In addition, the Company may elect to\nraise capital for strategic reasons even when it is not required to do so. The Company’s ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general\neconomic and market conditions, which are outside of its control, and on the Company’s operating and financial performance. Accordingly, the Company\ncannot be assured of its ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms could damage\nthe performance and value of its business, prompt regulatory intervention, and harm its reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period\nof time, its viability as a going concern could be threatened. If the Company is able to raise capital and does so by issuing common stock or convertible\nsecurities, the ownership interest of its existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of its common stock could decline.\nThe market price of the Company’s common stock could be adversely impacted by banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are\nperceived as having an anti-takeover effect. Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, impose significant restrictions\non the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any bank holding company, including the Company. Acquisition of ten percent or more of any class of voting\nstock of a bank holding company or depository institution, including shares of its common stock, generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer\n“controls” the bank holding company or depository institution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before,\namong other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank, including the Bank.\nIn addition, a non-negotiated acquisition of control over the Company may be inhibited by provisions of the Company’s restated articles of incorporation\nand bylaws that have been adopted in conformance with applicable corporate law, such as the ability to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the\nrights, terms, conditions and privileges of such preferred stock without stockholder approval. If any of these restrictions were to operate or be perceived as\noperating to hinder or deter a potential acquirer for the Company, the market price of the Company’s common stock could suffer.\nThe Company’s business relies on systems, employees, service providers, and counterparties, and failures or errors by any of them, intellectual\nproperty disputes, or other operational risks could adversely affect the Company. The Company engages in a variety of businesses in diverse markets and\nrelies on hosted and on-premises systems, employees, service providers, and counterparties to properly oversee, administer, and process a high volume of\ntransactions and otherwise support our day-to-day operations. This gives rise to meaningful operational risk—including the risk of fraud by employees or\noutside parties, unauthorized access to its premises or systems, errors in processing, failures of technology, breaches of internal controls or compliance\nsafeguards, inadequate integration of acquisitions, human error, unavailability of systems and services, and other breakdowns in business continuity plans. In\naddition, service providers utilizing technology or other intellectual property in connection with our services may make allegations of patent infringement or\nother intellectual property rights violations. Depending on the scope of the claim, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation, which is often time-\nconsuming, expensive and can be disruptive to the Company’s operations. If the Company were found to have infringed an intellectual property right, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, not all of which may be covered by insurance policies or subject to indemnification by the\nCompany’s service provider. These amounts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n16\nSignificant financial, business, reputational, regulatory, or other harm could come to the Company as a result of these or related risks and uncertainties.\nFor example, the Company could be negatively impacted if financial, accounting, data-processing, or other systems were to fail or not fully perform their\nfunctions. The Company also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a pandemic,\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disaster, geopolitical events, war, act of terrorism, accident, or other reason. These same risks arise as well in\nconnection with the systems and employees of the service providers and counterparties on whom the Company depends as well as their own third-party service\nproviders and counterparties. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Operational Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report for a\ndiscussion of how the Company monitors and manages operational risk.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the\nCompany. Financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. The Company routinely executes\ntransactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, payment processors, and\nother institutional clients, which may result in payment obligations to the Company or to its clients due to products it has arranged. Many of these transactions\nexpose the Company to credit and market risk that may cause its counterparty or client to default. In addition, the Company is exposed to market risk when the\ncollateral it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the secured obligation. Any losses arising from such\noccurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is heavily reliant on technology, and a failure or delay in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future\ntechnology needs or demands could adversely affect the Company’s business or performance. Like most financial-services companies, the Company\nsignificantly depends on technology to deliver its products and other services and to otherwise conduct business. To remain technologically competitive and\noperationally efficient, the Company invests in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives, including for both internally and externally\nhosted solutions. Many of these initiatives are of significant duration, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial internal and external resources.\nFurthermore, to the extent these initiatives may implicate new technologies or solutions such as those related to artificial intelligence or automation, additional\nrisk may be present. Although the Company takes steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, there is no guarantee that they\nwill be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative operational or customer impact. The Company also may not succeed in anticipating its future\ntechnology needs, the technology demands of its customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. In addition, the Company relies upon the expertise and\nsupport of service providers to help implement, maintain and/or service certain of its core technology solutions. If the Company cannot effectively manage\nthese service providers, the service parties fail to materially perform, or the Company was to falter in any of the other noted areas, its business or performance\ncould be negatively impacted.\nNegative publicity outside of the Company’s control, or its failure to successfully manage issues arising from its conduct or in connection with\nthe financial-services industry generally, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its business or performance. The performance\nand value of the Company’s business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that it may suffer. This harm could arise from negative publicity\noutside of its control or its failure to adequately address issues arising from its own conduct or in connection with the financial-services industry generally.\nRisks to the Company’s reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, cyber incidents and other security breaches, mergers and acquisitions,\nlending or investment-management practices, actual or potential conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, corporate governance, and unethical\nbehavior and practices committed by Company employees or competitors in the financial services industry.\nThe Company faces intense competition from other financial-services and financial-services technology companies, and competitive pressures\ncould adversely affect the Company’s business or performance. The Company faces intense competition in each of its business segments and in all of its\nmarkets and geographic regions, and the Company expects competitive pressures to intensify in the future—especially in light of recent legislative and\nregulatory initiatives, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current economic and market conditions, and government monetary and fiscal\npolicies. Competition with financial-services technology companies, or technology companies partnering with financial-services companies, may be\nparticularly intense, due to, among other things, differing regulatory environments. See “Competition” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures\nmay drive the Company to take actions that the Company might otherwise eschew, such as\n17\nlowering the interest rates or fees on loans or raising the interest rates on deposits in order to keep or attract high-quality customers. These pressures also may\naccelerate actions that the Company might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure. The Company has certain\nbusinesses that utilize wholesale models which can lead to customer concentrations for those businesses that, if negatively impacted by new entrants,\ncompetitive pressures, or consolidations, could affect the Company’s fee income. Whatever the reason, actions that the Company takes in response to\ncompetition may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if the Company is not successful in\nintroducing new products and other services, achieving market acceptance of its products and other services, developing and maintaining a strong customer\nbase, or prudently managing expenses.\nThe Company’s internal controls, risk-management and compliance programs or functions may not be effective in identifying and mitigating\nrisk and loss. The Company maintains standards on internal controls (including over financial reporting), and related disclosures which are regularly reviewed\nby management, as well as an enterprise risk-management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces.\nThese include interest-rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and compliance risk. The Company also maintains a\ncompliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on its adherence to applicable law, policies, and procedures. While the Company assesses and\nstrives to improve these controls and programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its frameworks or models for risk management, compliance,\nand related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company’s\nrisk-management or compliance programs or if its controls break down, the performance and value of the Company’s business could be adversely affected. The\nCompany could be negatively impacted as well if, despite programs being in place, its risk-management or compliance personnel are ineffective in executing\nthem and mitigating risk and loss.\nIf the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to the Company, it may be unable to satisfy its obligations\nto counterparties or creditors or make dividend payments to its stockholders. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries and depends on dividend payments and distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors and its\ndividend payments to stockholders. See “Regulation and Supervision—Requirements Affecting the Relationships among the Company, Its Subsidiaries, and\nOther Affiliates” in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Any of the Company’s subsidiaries, however, may be unable to make dividend payments or distributions to the\nCompany, including as a result of a deterioration in the subsidiary’s performance, investments in the subsidiary’s own future growth, or regulatory or\nsupervisory requirements. If any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, moreover, the Company’s right to participate in a distribution of\nassets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of the Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).\nAn inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect the Company’s business or performance. Skilled\nemployees are the Company’s most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation is among the Company’s\nhighest expenses, it may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with the Company, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level.\nRecent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial-services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, some parts of the\nCompany’s business are particularly dependent on key personnel, including investment management, asset servicing, and commercial lending. If the Company\nwere to lose and find itself unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent drove its compensation costs to\nunsustainable levels, the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of litigation and other proceedings, which could adversely affect its business or performance. The Company\nis involved from time to time in a variety of judicial, alternative-dispute, and other proceedings arising out of its business or operations. The Company\nestablishes reserves for claims when appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles, but costs often can be incurred in connection with a matter\nbefore any reserve has been created. The Company also maintains insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, but these policies\nhave deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Despite the Company’s efforts to appropriately reserve for claims and insure\nits business and operations, the actual costs associated with resolving a claim may be substantially higher than amounts reserved or covered. Substantial legal\nclaims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause\nreputational harm.\n18\nChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial statements and reported earnings. Accounting standard-setting bodies,\nsuch as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that affect the preparation of the\nCompany’s Consolidated Financial Statements. These changes are beyond the Company’s control and could have a meaningful impact on its Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nThe Company’s selection of accounting methods, assumptions, and estimates could impact its financial statements and reported earnings. To\ncomply with generally accepted accounting principles, management must sometimes exercise judgment in selecting, determining, and applying accounting\nmethods, assumptions, and estimates. This can arise, for example, in the determination of the allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, accounting methods,\nassumptions and estimates are part of acquisition purchase accounting and the calculation of the fair value of assets and liabilities that have been purchased,\nincluding credit-impaired loans. The judgments required of management can involve difficult, subjective, or complex matters with a high degree of uncertainty,\nand several different judgments could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported. See “Critical\nAccounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of this report. If management’s judgments are later determined to have been inaccurate, the Company may\nexperience unexpected losses that could be substantial.\nThe Company’s ability to engage in opportunistic mergers and acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that government\nauthorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than\nexpected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated. The Company may make opportunistic acquisitions of other financial-\nservices companies or businesses from time to time. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all. Even when the Company is able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing\nconditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any\nfailure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nAdditionally, acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including lower-than-expected performance or higher-than-expected costs,\ndifficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties,\nand the potential loss of key employees. An acquisition also could be dilutive to the Company’s current stockholders if preferred stock, common stock, or\nsecurities convertible into preferred stock or common stock were issued to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. The Company, moreover, may not be\nsuccessful in identifying acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing the expected value from acquisitions. There is\nsignificant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and the Company may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will pursue future acquisitions, and the Company’s ability to grow and successfully compete in its markets and\nregions may be impaired if it chooses not to pursue, or is unable to successfully complete, acquisitions.\nThe Company faces risks in connection with its strategic undertakings and new business initiatives. The Company is engaged, and may in the\nfuture engage, in strategic activities including acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There\ncan be no assurance that the Company will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that it will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such\nactivities, if undertaken, will be successful. The Company is focused on its long-term growth and has undertaken various strategic activities and business\ninitiatives, some of which may involve activities that are new to it. For example, in the future the Company may engage in or focus on new lines of business,\nfinancial technologies, and other activities that are outside of its current product offerings. These new initiatives may subject the Company to, among other risks,\nincreased business, reputational and operational risk, as well as more complex legal, regulatory and compliance costs and risks. Its ability to execute strategic\nactivities and new business initiatives successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may\ninclude the Company’s success in integrating an acquired company or a new internally-developed growth initiative into its business, operations, services,\nproducts, personnel and systems, operating effectively with any partner with whom it elects to do business, meeting applicable regulatory requirements and\nobtaining applicable regulatory licenses or other approvals, hiring or retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting management's\nexpectations, actually realizing the anticipated benefits of the activities, and overall general market conditions. The Company’s ability to address these matters\nsuccessfully cannot be assured. In addition, its strategic efforts may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may\nsubject the\n19\nCompany to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential liability. If the Company does not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect\nits business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, or growth prospects.\nExpectations around Environmental, Social and Governance practices, as well as climate change, and related legislative and regulatory\ninitiatives may result in additional risk and operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact the Company’s business. Companies\nare facing increased scrutiny from customers, regulators and other stakeholders with respect to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and\ndisclosures. Institutional investors, and investor advocacy groups, in particular, are increasingly focused on these matters, and expectations in many of these\nareas can vary widely. In addition, increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to the Company’s overall operational costs. Failure to adapt\nto or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, and fluctuations in these standards, could negatively impact the\nCompany’s reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and its stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent\nforms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nIn addition to regulatory and investor expectations on environmental matters in general, the current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating\nan increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In\nrecent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse\ngas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous\nlegislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and\nfees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require the Company to expend\nsignificant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks\nposed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact the Company’s financial condition and operations; however, as a banking\norganization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to the Company. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and\nother disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing the Company’s loans, which could diminish the value of\nthe Company’s loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on the Company’s\ncustomers, which could limit the Company’s ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nThere are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC required to be disclosed herein as of the date of this report.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nInformation security and privacy are an important part of the Company’s culture and foundational to its goal of delivering safe, secure and quality\nproducts and services. This philosophy is emphasized throughout the organization by its board of directors, senior leaders, officers, managers and associates to\nhelp promote a Company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management.\nFurther, the Company operates within the highly regulated financial services industry, which is focused on the security, confidentiality, integrity,\navailability and privacy of information and information systems. The standards of the SEC, the GLBA, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the\nFederal Financial Institution Examination Council (FFIEC) outline specific requirements regarding cybersecurity and data privacy for publicly traded and\nfinancial services companies. The Company has established information security and privacy policies focused on protecting the security, confidentiality,\nintegrity, availability and privacy of information, which policies are designed to be compliant with SEC, GLBA, GDPR, state privacy regulations and FFIEC\nguidance, as applicable, and incorporate principles from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other industry best-practices where\nappropriate. The Company’s security and privacy practices are also subject to ongoing independent oversight by multiple regulatory bodies including the OCC\nand the Federal Reserve, independent audits such as SOC I and SOC II, independent penetration testing of internal and external systems, independent security\nattestations of compliance with the requirements of the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial\n20\nTelecommunications (SWIFT) and the Federal Reserve (FedLine), and independent assessments in connection with the Company’s Payment Card Industry Data\nSecurity Standard (PCI DSS) obligations, as applicable.\nAs a financial institution, the Company collects, stores, and transmits sensitive, confidential, and proprietary data and other information, including\nintellectual property, business information, funds-transfer instructions, payment card data, and the personally identifiable information of its customers and\nemployees (Sensitive Information). Sensitive Information can be of significant value to criminal actors, and, as described in the Company’s Risk Factors, cyber\nincidents and other security breaches involving this information at the Company, at the Company’s service providers or counterparties, or in the business\ncommunity or markets, may negatively impact the Company’s business or performance.\nThe board of directors of the Company has oversight responsibility for the risk management policies of the Company’s global operations and the\noperation of the Company’s global risk management framework. The Board Risk Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, assists the board of\ndirectors with this responsibility by, among other things, approving and periodically reviewing the risk management policies of the Company’s global\noperations, including statements of risk appetite, and adapting the Enterprise Risk Management Policy, when and as appropriate, to changes in the Company’s\nstructure, risk profile, complexity, activities, or size. The combined Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer (CISO/CPO) supplies the\nBoard, directly or through the Board Risk Committee, with regular reports on the operation of the information security and privacy components of this program,\nthe related evolving risks to the Company’s businesses, and the controls and other mitigants utilized to manage those risks. Membership in the Board Risk\nCommittee includes directors experienced at managing risk in various environments, including cybersecurity. Their expertise helps inform the Company’s\ncybersecurity and privacy program.\nManagement is responsible for the daily assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. This is accomplished through a variety of tools and\nmechanisms. The Company has strategically integrated cybersecurity and privacy risk management into its broader risk management framework. This\nintegration ensures that cybersecurity and privacy considerations are an integral part of the Company's decision-making processes at multiple levels. The\nCompany has appointed a qualified CISO/CPO, who reports to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) as part of independent risk management, who is responsible for\nestablishing strategy and overseeing implementation of an effective, integrated, and proactive information security and privacy program. The CISO/CPO is also\nresponsible for advising and partnering with the board of directors, management team, and lines of business to guide the management of cybersecurity, business\ncontinuity and resilience, physical information security, data privacy, third party and information governance risks. The CISO/CPO has more than two decades\nof global experience within the information security and privacy fields, a relevant bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution, and holds the National\nAssociation of Corporate Directors Directorship Certification (NACD.DC), Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified\nInformation Privacy Professional (CIPP/US) designations. The CISO/CPO manages a team of qualified professionals with relevant cybersecurity and privacy\nexperience and expertise. The Company has also established a Security, Technology, and Privacy Committee (STP) to oversee security, technology, and privacy\ncapabilities and risks of the Company and its business. The STP includes the CRO, CISO/CPO, leadership across the lines of business, and a cross-functional\nteam of risk, technology, privacy and legal experts to ensure an appropriate focus on information security, technology and privacy matters. The STP serves as a\nsub-committee of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC), which is a sub-committee of the Board Risk Committee. The ERC is chaired by the CRO,\nand includes members of executive management and a cross-functional team of leaders experienced in managing risk. The STP and ERC receive quarterly\nbriefings from the CISO/CPO on a variety of topics, including material changes in information security or privacy laws, the Company’s ongoing information\nsecurity posture and compliance, and emerging risks. Company management and its committees may also engage with the CISO/CPO to discuss and receive\nadditional reports regarding cybersecurity and privacy risks on a more frequent basis as appropriate.\nKey Program Components\nThe Company has a vulnerability management program designed to assess and manage risk associated with vulnerabilities in its information systems\nfrom multiple perspectives, including: (i) an adversarial cyber risk assessment that aims to identify threats, vulnerabilities and controls and (ii) the scanning of\nexternal and internal information systems to identify software vulnerabilities. The vulnerability management program also assesses emerging and potential\nthreats through dedicated threat intelligence capabilities that monitor attacks and breaches associated with financial institutions and key third-party service\nproviders. The CISO/CPO utilizes the data to understand potential exposure to the Company and to take preventative action where appropriate.\n21\nThe Company has an Incident Response Program (IRP) to support management of cybersecurity or privacy incidents, impact assessment (i.e., type and\nquantity of data impacted, materiality, etc.), and response coordination including with law enforcement and government agencies, and impacted parties.\nNotification procedures are aligned with applicable laws, regulatory and contractual requirements, including rules promulgated by the SEC, the GLBA, the\nGDPR and state privacy regulations. The Company’s IRP, led by the CISO/CPO, includes a cross-functional group of risk, technology, privacy and legal experts\nsupplemented by third-party service providers, where necessary, to support the Company’s response to potential cybersecurity or privacy incidents. The IRP sets\nforth the framework to elevate cybersecurity or privacy issues to the CISO/CPO and when and how incidents are escalated and reported beyond the CISO/CPO,\nincluding to executive management and the Board Risk Committee. Depending on the incident, escalation to the full board of directors may also occur.\nThe Company has also implemented a third-party risk program to oversee and manage information security and privacy risks associated with third-party\nrelationships. The program includes the assessment of third parties that provide key services or will access, store, process, or transmit Sensitive Information\nduring initial onboarding and throughout the lifecycle of the relationship, and management of applicable contractual provisions relating to confidentiality,\nintegrity, availability and privacy obligations, including notification of incidents. The Company also leverages third-party services for advice, assessments,\nauditing, testing and support related to cybersecurity and information technology processes and services, where appropriate, that are also subject to the third-\nparty risk program.\nNotwithstanding the breadth of the Company’s information security and privacy program, it may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a\ncybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse impact. For a discussion of whether and how any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result\nof any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy,\nresults of operations or financial condition, see Item 1A “Risk Factors”, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1C.\nITEM 2.

The Company does not undertake to\nupdate any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of events, circumstances, or results that arise after the date that the statement was made, except as\nrequired by applicable securities laws. You, however, should consult further disclosures (including disclosures of a forward-looking nature) that the Company\nmay make in any subsequent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Current Report on Form 8-K.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios, and the recent bank\nruns that led to the failures of some financial institutions in March of 2023, among other events, have resulted in significant volatility in the U.S. banking sector\nand heightened focus on liquidity, uninsured deposits, deposit composition, unrecognized investment losses, and capital.\n27\nDuring November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the losses to the DIF associated with protecting\nuninsured depositors following the closures of certain financial institutions in early 2023. The assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured\ndepository institution’s uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion, and will be collected at an annual rate of 13.4 basis\npoints for eight quarterly assessment periods. The Company’s portion of this special assessment was $52.8 million and was recognized in noninterest expense\nduring the fourth quarter of 2023 and its impacts are discussed below.\nThe Company focuses on the following four core financial objectives. Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision,\nto deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk\nmanagement.\nThe first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify its\norganizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and\ndistribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when\ncombined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. For 2023, total revenue decreased 0.4%, and noninterest expense increased\n11.2%, as compared to the previous year. Revenue for 2022 included a $66.2 million gain realized on the sale of the Company’s Visa Inc. Class B common\nshares. Noninterest expense for 2023 included the special FDIC assessment of $52.8 million as discussed above. The Company continues to invest in\ntechnological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the future through improved data analysis and automation. The\nCompany also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes will yield operating efficiencies.\nThe second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet.\nFor 2023, net interest income increased $6.3 million, or 0.7%, as compared to the previous year. The Company has shown increased net interest income through\nthe effects of increased volume and mix of average earning assets, coupled with higher interest rates. This increase was partially offset by higher interest-\nbearing deposit rates and increased borrowed funds. Average earning assets increased $1.9 billion, or 5.3%, compared to 2022. Average loan balances increased\n$3.5 billion, partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds and resell agreements of $649.8 million, a decrease in average securities of $613.8 million,\nand a decrease in average interest-bearing due from banks of $362.1 million from the prior year. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a 16.9%\nincrease in average interest-bearing deposits, and a 647.5% increase in average borrowed funds, partially offset by a decrease of 19.8% in noninterest-bearing\ndeposits. Net interest margin, on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis, decreased 11 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 in large part due to repricing\nand mix changes of interest-bearing liabilities with the increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the benefit of free funds and the\nrepricing of earning assets. Net interest spread contracted by 83 basis points during the same period.\nThe third financial objective is to grow the Company’s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout\nall economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income decreased $12.4 million, or 2.2%, to\n$541.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was driven by a $66.2 million gain realized\non the sale of the Company’s Visa Inc. Class B common shares in 2022. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under Noninterest income. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, noninterest income represented 37.1% of total revenues, as compared to 37.8% for 2022.\nThe fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position,\nwhich management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company’s ability to\ncapitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic\ngrowth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company’s strategies, increasing dividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share\nrepurchase program. At December 31, 2023, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.85% and $3.1 billion in total shareholders’ equity, an\nincrease of $433.3 million, or 16.2%, compared to total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022. The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock\nduring 2023 except for shares acquired pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs. In 2023, the Company declared $75.3 million in dividends,\nwhich represents a 3.7% increase compared to dividends declared during 2022.\n28\nEarnings Summary\nThe Company recorded consolidated net income of $350.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This represents an 18.9% decrease over 2022.\nNet income for 2022 was $431.7 million, or an increase of 22.3% compared to 2021. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2023, were\n$7.22 per share compared to $8.93 per share in 2022, a decrease of 19.1%. Basic earnings per share were $7.31 per share in 2021, or an increase of 22.2% from\n2021 to 2022. Fully diluted earnings per share decreased 19.0% from 2022 to 2023 and increased 22.4% from 2021 to 2022. Return on average assets and\nreturn on average common shareholder’s equity for the year ended December 31, 2023 were 0.88% and 12.23%, respectively, compared to 1.15% and 15.83%,\nrespectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholder’s equity for the year ended December\n31, 2021 were 1.00% and 11.43%, respectively.\nThe Company’s net interest income increased to $920.1 million in 2023 compared to $913.8 million in 2022 and $815.5 million in 2021. In total, net\ninterest income increased $6.3 million, as compared to 2022, primarily driven by a favorable volume variance of $7.8 million, offset by a $1.5 million rate\nvariance. See Table 2. The favorable volume variance on earning assets was predominantly driven by an increase of $1.9 billion, or 5.3%, in average earning\nassets. In 2023, average loan balances increased $3.5 billion, partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds and resell agreements of $649.8 million, a\ndecrease in average securities balances of $613.8 million, and a decrease in interest-bearing due from banks of $362.1 million as compared to 2022. Net interest\nmargin, on an FTE basis, decreased to 2.52% for 2023, compared to 2.63% for the same period in 2022, driven by repricing and mix changes of interest-bearing\nliabilities with the increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the benefit of free funds and the repricing of earning assets. Net interest\nspread contracted by 83 basis points during the same period. The Company has seen an increase in the benefit from interest-free funds as compared to 2022\ndriven by the increase in short-term interest rates. The impact of this benefit increased 72 basis points compared to 2022 and is illustrated on Table 3. The\nmagnitude and duration of this impact will be largely dependent upon the FRB’s policy decisions and market movements. See Table 18 in Item 7A for an\nillustration of the impact of an interest rate increase or decrease on net interest income as of December 31, 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses totaled $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is an increase of $3.3 million, or 8.8%, compared to\nthe same period in 2022. This change is the result of applying the CECL methodology for computing the allowance for credit losses, coupled with the impacts\nof loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior period. See further discussion in\n“Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses” in this report.\nThe Company had a decrease of $12.4 million, or 2.2%, in noninterest income in 2023, as compared to 2022, and an increase of $87.1 million, or 18.6%,\nin 2022, compared to 2021. The decrease in 2023 is primarily driven by decreased investment securities gains, net of $61.6 million, partially offset by an\nincrease in trust and securities processing of $20.0 million and other income of $21.0 million. The increase in 2022 is primarily driven by increased investment\nsecurities gains, net of $53.4 million and brokerage fees of $30.8 million. The change in noninterest income in 2023 from 2022, and 2022 from 2021 is\nillustrated in Table 6.\nNoninterest expense increased in 2023 by $101.0 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2022 and increased by $64.5 million, or 7.7%, in 2022 compared to\n2021. The increase in 2023 is primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment of $52.8 million, and increases in salaries and employee benefits expense and\nprocessing fees. The increase in 2022 is primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefit expense, processing fees, other miscellaneous expense,\nbankcard expense, marketing and business development expense, and legal and consulting expense. The increase in noninterest expense in 2023 from 2022, and\n2022 from 2021 is illustrated in Table 7 and below under Noninterest Expense.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is a significant source of the Company’s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the\ninterest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest earning-assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the\ninterest rates paid on each affect net interest income. Table 2 summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for 2023,\n2022 and 2021.\nNet interest margin, presented in Table 1, is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to adjust for the\n29\ntax-exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments, which are primarily obligations of state and local governments. A critical component of net\ninterest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-free sources. Table 3 analyzes net interest margin for the\nthree years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Net interest income, average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid\nfor the years 2021 through 2023 are presented in Table 1 below.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities\nand resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates.\nTable 1\nTHREE YEAR AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis)\n(in millions)\n2023 2022\nInterest Interest\nAverage Income/ Rate Earned/ Average Income/ Rate Earned/\nBalance Expense (1) Paid (1) Balance Expense (1) Paid (1)\nASSETS\nLoans and loans held for sale (FTE) (2) (3) $ 22,337.1 $ 1,400.2 6.27% $ 18,823.8 $ 810.1 4.30%\nSecurities:\nTaxable 9,097.1 215.0 2.36 9,616.7 192.1 2.00\nTax-exempt (FTE) 3,790.9 128.2 3.38 3,885.1 122.8 3.16\nTotal securities 12,888.0 343.2 2.66 13,501.8 314.9 2.33\nFederal funds sold and resell agreements 316.1 17.7 5.58 965.9 19.1 1.98\nInterest-bearing due from banks 2,046.4 103.2 5.04 2,408.5 18.6 0.77\nOther earning assets (FTE) 14.0 0.8 5.65 12.1 0.6 4.96\nTotal earning assets (FTE) 37,601.6 1,865.1 4.96 35,712.1 1,163.3 3.26\nAllowance for credit losses (216.2) (184.1)\nCash and due from banks 456.6 420.0\nOther assets 1,888.3 1,631.0\nTotal assets $ 39,730.3 $ 37,579.0\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nInterest-bearing demand and savings deposits $ 18,374.9 $ 588.3 3.20% $ 17,333.0 $ 162.2 0.94%\nTime deposits under $250,000 1,967.0 92.4 4.70 95.0 0.7 0.74\nTime deposits of $250,000 or more 780.4 23.5 3.01 635.5 4.6 0.72\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 21,122.3 704.2 3.33 18,063.5 167.5 0.93\nShort-term debt 1,929.0 96.4 5.00 8.6 0.3 3.49\nLong-term debt 382.3 25.0 6.54 300.6 15.2 5.06\nFederal funds purchased 170.0 8.4 4.97 249.7 5.2 2.10\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 2,005.4 84.6 4.22 2,527.4 35.5 1.40\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 25,609.0 918.6 3.59 21,149.8 223.7 1.06\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits 10,640.4 13,264.1\nOther 618.2 438.8\nTotal 36,867.6 34,852.7\nTotal shareholders' equity 2,862.7 2,726.3\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 39,730.3 $ 37,579.0\nNet interest income (FTE) $ 946.5 $ 939.6\nNet interest spread (FTE) 1.37% 2.20%\nNet interest margin (FTE) 2.52% 2.63%\n(1) Interest income and yields are stated on an FTE basis, using a marginal tax rate of 21% for 2023, 2022, and 2021.

This\nfollows an increase of $98.3 million, or 12.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. Average earning assets for the year ended December\n31, 2023 increased by $1.9 billion, or 5.3%, compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 2.52% for 2023\ncompared to 2.63% in 2022.\nThe Company funds a significant portion of its balance sheet with noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\nrepresented 33.9%, 40.6% and 45.9% of total outstanding deposits as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in 2023 is driven by the\nincrease in short-term interest rates. As illustrated in Table 3, the impact from these interest-free funds was 115 basis points in 2023, as compared to 43 basis\npoints in 2022 and eight basis points in 2021.\nThe Company experienced an increase in net interest income during 2023 due to a volume variance of $7.8 million, offset by a negative rate variance of\n$1.5 million. The average rate on earning assets during 2023 has increased by 170 basis points, while the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by\n253 basis points, resulting in a 83 basis-point decrease in spread. The volume of loans has increased from an average of $18.8 billion in 2022 to an average of\n$22.3 billion in 2023, driven by organic loan growth. The volume of interest-bearing liabilities increased from $21.1 billion in 2022 to $25.6 billion in 2023.\nThe Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain\nconstraints. These changing economic conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company\nin 2024. Loan-related earning assets tend to generate a higher spread than those earned in the Company’s investment portfolio. By design, the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio is moderate in duration and liquid in its composition of assets.\nDuring 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of available-for-sale securities are expected to have principal repayments. This includes approximately $1.1\nbillion that will have principal repayments during the first quarter of 2024. The available-for-sale investment portfolio had an average life of 52.6 months, 62.3\nmonths, and 67.6 months as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nProvision and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL represents management’s judgment of total expected losses included in the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The\nCompany’s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company’s lifetime historical loss experience, management’s understanding of the\ncredit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.\nA mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management’s recorded ACL. To develop\nthe estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC 326).\nThe estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the Company’s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets\nheld at amortized cost include the Company’s loan book and held-to-maturity security portfolio.\n33\nThe process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been\nestablished over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce\na lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy\nStatement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is\nconsidered.\nThe Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive\nmethodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company’s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the\nCompany’s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of\neconomic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s).\nBased on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant\nadjustments to estimated credit losses.\nThe ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management’s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the\nloan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.\nTable 4 presents the components of the allowance by loan portfolio segment. The Company manages the ACL against the risk in the entire loan portfolio\nand therefore, the allocation of the ACL to a particular loan segment may change in the future. Management of the Company believes the present ACL is\nadequate considering the Company’s loss experience, delinquency trends and current economic conditions. Future economic conditions and borrowers’ ability\nto meet their obligations, however, are uncertainties which could affect the Company’s ACL and/or need to change its current level of provision. For more\ninformation on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nTable 4\nALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS (in thousands)\nThis table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and percent of loans to total loans by loan portfolio segment, which represents the\ntotal expected losses derived by both quantitative and qualitative methods.

For more information on loan portfolio segments and ACL methodology refer to Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements.\n34\nAs illustrated in Table 5 below, the ACL increased as a percentage of total loans to 0.95% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 0.91% as of December\n31, 2022. The provision for credit losses, including provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures, totaled $41.2 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, which is an increase of $3.3 million, or 8.8%, compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for credit losses, including provision for off-balance\nsheet credit exposures, totaled $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is the result of the impacts of loan growth, portfolio metric\nchanges, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior period.\nTable 5\nANALYSIS OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (in thousands)\n2023 2022\nAllowance – January 1 $ 194,243 $ 196,711\nProvision for credit losses 39,227 37,400\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial (5,047) (37,269)\nSpecialty lending (762) —\nCommercial real estate (266) (29)\nConsumer real estate (1,185) (57)\nConsumer (1,232) (800)\nCredit cards (9,181) (6,150)\nLeases and other — —\nTotal charge-offs (17,673) (44,305)\nRecoveries:\nCommercial and industrial 5,295 1,550\nSpecialty lending 1 433\nCommercial real estate 111 385\nConsumer real estate 45 131\nConsumer 211 126\nCredit cards 1,536 1,812\nLeases and other — —\nTotal recoveries 7,199 4,437\nNet charge-offs (10,474) (39,868)\nAllowance for credit losses – end of period $ 222,996 $ 194,243\nAllowance for credit losses on loans $ 219,738 $ 191,836\nAllowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities 3,258 2,407\nLoans at end of year, net of unearned interest 23,172,484 21,031,189\nHeld-to-maturity securities at end of period 5,691,868 5,861,599\nTotal assets at amortized cost 28,864,352 26,892,788\nAverage loans, net of unearned interest 22,334,942 18,822,416\nAllowance for credit losses on loans to loans at end of period 0.95% 0.91%\nAllowance for credit losses – end of period to total assets at amortized cost 0.77% 0.72%\nAllowance as a multiple of net charge-offs 21.29x 4.87x\nNet charge-offs to average loans 0.05% 0.21%\nNoninterest Income\nA key objective of the Company is the growth of noninterest income to provide a diverse source of revenue not directly tied to interest rates. Fee-based\nservices are typically non-credit related and are not generally affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Noninterest income decreased in 2023 by $12.4 million,\nor 2.2%, compared to 2022 and increased in 2022 by $87.1 million, or 18.6%, compared to 2021. The decrease in 2023 is primarily driven by decreased\ninvestment securities gains, net, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous income and trust and securities processing income. The increase in 2022\nis primarily attributable to an increase in investment securities gains, net, coupled with an increase in brokerage fee income and trust and securities processing\nincome. These were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous income. Changes in Noninterest income are presented in Table 6 below.\nThe Company’s fee-based services offer multiple products and services, which management believes will more closely align with customer product\ndemands. The Company is currently emphasizing fee-based services\n35\nincluding trust and securities processing, bankcard, securities trading and brokerage and cash and treasury management. Management believes that it can offer\nthese products and services both efficiently and profitably, as most have common platforms and support structures.\nTable 6\nSUMMARY OF NONINTEREST INCOME (in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percent Change\n2023 2022 2021 23-22 22-21 23-22 22-21\nTrust and securities processing $ 257,200 $ 237,207 $ 224,126 $ 19,993 $ 13,081 8.4% 5.8%\nTrading and investment banking 19,630 23,201 30,939 (3,571) (7,738) (15.4) (25.0)\nService charges on deposit accounts 84,950 85,167 86,056 (217) (889) (0.3) (1.0)\nInsurance fees and commissions 1,009 1,338 1,309 (329) 29 (24.6) 2.2\nBrokerage fees 54,119 43,019 12,171 11,100 30,848 25.8 253.5\nBankcard fees 74,719 73,451 64,576 1,268 8,875 1.7 13.7\nInvestment securities (losses) gains, net (3,139) 58,444 5,057 (61,583) 53,387 (105.4) 1,055.7\nOther 53,365 32,406 42,941 20,959 (10,535) 64.7 (24.5)\nTotal noninterest income $ 541,853 $ 554,233 $ 467,175 $ (12,380) $ 87,058 (2.2)% 18.6%\nNoninterest income and the year-over-year changes in noninterest income are summarized in Table 6 above. The dollar change and percent change\ncolumns highlight the respective net increase or decrease in the categories of noninterest income in 2023 compared to 2022, and in 2022 compared to 2021.\nTrust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments\nand wealth management services, and mutual fund assets servicing. This income category increased by $20.0 million, or 8.4% in 2023, compared to 2022, and\nincreased by $13.1 million, or 5.8%, in 2022, compared to 2021. During 2023, fund services income increased $12.2 million and corporate trust income\nincreased $7.7 million. During 2022, fund services income increased $12.9 million and corporate trust income increased $6.5 million, partially offset by a\ndecrease in wealth management income of $6.3 million. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities\nprocessing fees are primarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income will be affected by changes\nin the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the\ndistribution channels.\nTrading and investment banking income decreased $3.6 million, or 15.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased $7.7 million, or 25.0%, in 2022\ncompared to 2021. These decreases were driven by lower trading volume and lower market values.\nService charges on deposits income decreased $0.2 million, or 0.3%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased $0.9 million, or 1.0%, in 2022 compared\nto 2021. The decrease in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by decreased healthcare services income, offset by increased commercial service charge income.\nThe decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by decreased healthcare services income, partially offset by increased consumer service charge income.\nBrokerage fees increased $11.1 million, or 25.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $30.8 million, or 253.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The\nincrease in both years was driven by increased 12b-1 and money market fees driven by the increase in short-term interest rates.\nBankcard fees increased $1.3 million, or 1.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022, and increased $8.9 million, or 13.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. These\nincreases were primarily driven by increased interchange income, partially offset by increased rewards and rebate expense.\nInvestment securities gains, net decreased $61.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $53.4 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease\nin 2023 and increase in 2022 was primarily driven by a $66.2 million gain realized on the sale of the Company’s Visa Inc. Class B common shares in 2022.\n36\nOther noninterest income increased $21.0 million, or 64.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased $10.5 million, or 24.5%, in 2022 compared to\n2021. The increase in 2023 and decrease in 2022 was primarily driven by market value changes in company-owned life insurance income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased in 2023 by $101.0 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2022 and increased in 2022 by $64.5 million, or 7.7%, compared to\n2021. From 2022 to 2023 the increase was driven by a $52.8 million FDIC special assessment, increases in salaries and employee benefits expense and\nprocessing fees, and partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense. From 2021 to 2022 the increase was driven by increases in salaries and\nemployee benefits expense, processing fees, other miscellaneous expense, bankcard expense, and marketing and business development expense. Table 7 below\nsummarizes the components of noninterest expense and the respective year-over-year changes for each category.\nTable 7\nSUMMARY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE (in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percent Change\n2023 2022 2021 23-22 22-21 23-22 22-21\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 553,421 $ 524,431 $ 504,442 $ 28,990 $ 19,989 5.5% 4.0%\nOccupancy, net 48,502 48,848 47,345 (346) 1,503 (0.7) 3.2\nEquipment 68,718 74,259 78,398 (5,541) (4,139) (7.5) (5.3)\nSupplies and services 16,829 13,590 14,986 3,239 (1,396) 23.8 (9.3)\nMarketing and business development 25,749 25,699 18,533 50 7,166 0.2 38.7\nProcessing fees 103,099 82,227 67,563 20,872 14,664 25.4 21.7\nLegal and consulting 29,998 39,095 32,406 (9,097) 6,689 (23.3) 20.6\nBankcard 32,969 26,367 19,145 6,602 7,222 25.0 37.7\nAmortization of other intangible assets 8,587 5,037 4,757 3,550 280 70.5 5.9\nRegulatory fees 77,010 15,378 11,894 61,632 3,484 400.8 29.3\nOther 34,258 43,188 34,167 (8,930) 9,021 (20.7) 26.4\nTotal noninterest expense $ 999,140 $ 898,119 $ 833,636 $ 101,021 $ 64,483 11.2% 7.7%\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $29.0 million, or 5.5%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and $20.0 million, or 4.0%, in 2022 compared to\n2021. In 2023, salaries and wage expense increased $23.8 million, or 7.5% and employee benefits expense of $20.5 million, or 26.0%. These increases were\noffset by a decrease in bonus and commission expense of $15.3 million, or 11.8%. In 2022, salaries and wage expense increased $17.5 million, or 5.9% and\nbonus and commission expense increased $4.4 million, or 3.5%, driven by business volumes and revenue growth, and higher company performance. These\nincreases were offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense of $1.9 million, or 2.3%.\nEquipment expense decreased $5.5 million, or 7.5%, in 2023 compared to 2022, and decreased $4.1 million, or 5.3%, from 2021 to 2022. The decreases\nin both years were driven by lower software expense related to a transition to cloud-based computing solutions.\nMarketing and business development expense was flat in 2023 compared to 2022, and increased $7.2 million, or 38.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The\nincrease in 2022 was driven by the timing of advertising and business development projects and higher travel expenses as compared to the prior year.\nProcessing fees expense increased $20.9 million, or 25.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022, and increased $14.7 million, or 21.7%, in 2022 compared to\n2021. The increases in 2023 and 2022 were primarily driven by the transition to cloud computing solutions and ongoing investments in digital channel and\nintegrated platform solutions to support business growth and the continued modernization of core systems.\nLegal and consulting expense decreased $9.1 million, or 23.3%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $6.7 million, or 20.6%, in 2022 compared to\n2021. The decrease in 2023 and the increase in 2022 were primarily driven by fluctuations in legal and consulting expense due to the timing of multiple projects\nbetween years.\n37\nBankcard expense increased $6.6 million, or 25.0%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $7.2 million, or 37.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. These\nincreases were driven by higher card administration costs coupled with higher fraud losses.\nRegulatory fees increased $61.6 million, or 400.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $3.5 million, or 29.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The\nincrease in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by the FDIC special assessment of $52.8 million. The increase in 2022 was driven by a higher assessment base.\nOther noninterest expense decreased $8.9 million, or 20.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $9.0 million, or 26.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021.\nThe decrease in 2023 was driven by lower charitable contribution expenses and operational losses. The increase in 2022 was driven by higher operational losses\nand increased charitable contributions expense.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense totaled $71.6 million, $100.3 million, and $76.0 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. These amounts equate to effective tax\nrates of 17.0%, 18.9%, and 17.7% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 is primarily attributable to a\nlarger portion of pre-tax income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities and excludable life insurance policy gains. The increase in the effective tax\nrate from 2021 to 2022 is primarily attributable to a smaller portion of pre-tax income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities.\nFor further information on income taxes refer to Note 16, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking, and\nPersonal Banking (collectively, the Business Segments). Senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the\nCompany’s internal reporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. The management\naccounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each Business Segment using methodologies that are refined on an ongoing basis. For\ncomparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on methodologies in effect at December 31, 2023. Previously reported results have been reclassified in\nthis Form 10-K to conform to the Company’s current organizational structure.\nTable 8\nCOMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATING RESULTS (in thousands)\nYear Ended Dollar Percent\nDecember 31, Change Change\n2023 2022 23-22 23-22\nNet interest income $ 598,371 $ 596,031 $ 2,340 0.4%\nProvision for credit losses 33,184 32,851 333 1.0\nNoninterest income 97,614 122,614 (25,000) (20.4)\nNoninterest expense 365,856 332,912 32,944 9.9\nIncome before taxes 296,945 352,882 (55,937) (15.9)\nIncome tax expense 48,403 67,134 (18,731) (27.9)\nNet income $ 248,542 $ 285,748 $ (37,206) (13.0)%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Commercial Banking net income decreased $37.2 million, or 13.0%, to $248.5 million compared to the same\nperiod in 2022. Net interest income increased $2.3 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period last year, driven by\nstrong loan growth and increased earning asset yields, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher interest rates and unfavorable changes in the\nmix of interest-bearing liabilities. Provision for credit losses increased $0.3 million, or 1.0%, as compared to 2022, driven by loan growth, portfolio metric\nchanges, and changes in macro-economic metrics in 2023 as compared to 2022. Noninterest income decreased $25.0 million, or 20.4%, over the same period in\n2022. This decrease was primarily due to an allocated portion of the gain on the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares\n38\nrecorded during 2022, coupled with a decrease of $5.3 million in other income due to reduced derivative income and the gain on the sale of the Company's\nfactoring loan portfolio recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Noninterest expense increased $32.9 million, or 9.9%, as compared to the same period in 2022.\nThis increase was driven by the allocation of $28.5 million of the $52.8 million FDIC special assessment recorded in 2023, coupled with increases of $2.8\nmillion in salaries and employee benefits expense, $2.5 million in operational losses, $2.3 million in processing fees, and $1.2 million in bankcard expense.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4.3 million in legal and professional fees as compared to 2022.\nTable 9\nINSTITUTIONAL BANKING OPERATING RESULTS (in thousands)\nYear Ended Dollar Percent\nDecember 31, Change Change\n2023 2022 23-22 23-22\nNet interest income $ 192,765 $ 159,679 $ 33,086 20.7%\nProvision for credit losses 1,406 495 911 184.0\nNoninterest income 347,933 323,794 24,139 7.5\nNoninterest expense 382,770 320,976 61,794 19.3\nIncome before taxes 156,522 162,002 (5,480) (3.4)\nIncome tax expense 26,838 31,889 (5,051) (15.8)\nNet income $ 129,684 $ 130,113 $ (429) (0.3)%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Institutional Banking net income decreased $0.4 million, or 0.3%, compared to the same period last year. Net\ninterest income increased $33.1 million, or 20.7%, compared to the same period last year, due to an increase in funds transfer pricing due to the increase in\ninterest rates. Provision for credit losses increased $0.9 million as compared to 2022, driven by loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in the\nmacro-economic metrics in 2023 as compared to 2022. Noninterest income increased $24.1 million, or 7.5%, primarily due to increases of $20.2 million in trust\nand securities processing, $11.3 million in brokerage fees, and $4.8 million in bankcard income, partially offset by a decrease in income related to the allocated\nportion of the gain on the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares during 2022 and a decrease of $3.9 million in trading and investment banking income.\nNoninterest expense increased $61.8 million, or 19.3% as compared to 2022, primarily driven by an allocation of $24.3 million of the $52.8 million FDIC\nspecial assessment recorded in 2023. This increase was coupled with increases of $19.4 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, $3.9 million in\nbankcard expense, $3.9 million in operational losses, $3.6 million in software expense, $3.6 million in intangible amortization, and $2.6 million in processing\nfees.\nTable 10\nPERSONAL BANKING OPERATING RESULTS (in thousands)\nYear Ended Dollar Percent\nDecember 31, Change Change\n2023 2022 23-22 23-22\nNet interest income $ 128,980 $ 158,087 $ (29,107) (18.4)%\nProvision for credit losses 6,637 4,554 2,083 45.7\nNoninterest income 96,306 107,825 (11,519) (10.7)\nNoninterest expense 250,514 244,231 6,283 2.6\n(Loss) income before taxes (31,865) 17,127 (48,992) (286.1)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (3,663) 1,306 (4,969) (380.5)\nNet (loss) income $ (28,202) $ 15,821 $ (44,023) (278.3)%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Personal Banking net income decreased $44.0 million, or 278.3%, as compared to the same period last year. Net\ninterest income decreased $29.1 million, or 18.4%, compared to the same period last year due to higher deposit interest expense driven by the increase in short-\nterm interest rates. Provision for credit losses increased $2.1 million, or 45.7%, for the period, driven by loan growth, portfolio metric changes, and changes in\nmacro-economic metrics in 2023 as compared to 2022. Noninterest income decreased $11.5 million, or 10.7%, primarily due to an allocated portion of the gain\non the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares recorded in 2022, coupled with decreases of $2.4 million in bankcard income and $1.6 million in service\n39\ncharges on deposits. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.7 million in other income driven by the gain on the sale of other assets during the\nsecond quarter of 2023, and an increase of $2.0 million in the valuation of the Company's non-marketable securities. Noninterest expense increased $6.3\nmillion, or 2.6%, primarily due to increases of $2.3 million in operational losses, $2.1 million in regulatory fees, $1.9 million in salaries and employee benefits,\nand $1.2 million in bankcard expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nLoans and Loans Held For Sale\nLoans represent the Company’s largest source of interest income. Loan balances held for investment increased by $2.1 billion, or 10.2%, in 2023. This\nincrease was primarily driven by an increase of $1.3 billion, or 16.8%, in commercial real estate loans, $723.9 million, or 7.9%, in commercial and industrial\nloans, and $237.4 million, or 8.7% in consumer real estate loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans continue to represent the largest segments of the Company’s loan portfolio, comprising\napproximately 42.8% and 38.4%, respectively, of total loans and loans held for sale at the end of 2023 and 43.8% and 36.2%, respectively, of total loans and\nloans held for sale at the end of 2022.\nCommercial and industrial loans represent the largest percent of total loans. Commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2023 increased $723.9\nmillion, or 7.9%, as compared to December 31, 2022, to 42.8% of total loans. Commercial and industrial loans represented 43.8% of total loans at December\n31, 2022.\nAs a percentage of total loans, commercial real estate comprises 38.4% of total loans compared to 36.2% in 2022. Commercial real estate loans\nincreased $1.3 billion, or 16.8%, compared to 2022. Generally, these loans are made for investment and real estate development or working capital and business\nexpansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80%. Most of these properties are non-owner occupied and have\nguarantees as additional security. The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This\ndiversity helps reduce exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Notwithstanding, commercial real estate loans, in general,\nmay be more adversely impacted by conditions in the real estate market or the economy.\nConsumer real estate loans increased $237.4 million, or 8.7%, compared to 2022. These loans represented 12.8% of total loans as of December 31,\n2023, compared to 12.9% as of December 31, 2022.\nFor further information on loan portfolio segments refer to Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nNonaccrual, past due and restructured loans are discussed under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk – Credit Risk Management”\nin Item 7A of this report.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company’s investment portfolio contains trading, available-for-sale (AFS), and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as well as FRB stock, Federal\nHome Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, and other miscellaneous investments. Investment securities totaled $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $13.2 billion as\nof December 31, 2022 and comprised 31.9% and 36.5% of the Company’s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates.\nDuring 2022, securities with an amortized cost of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion were transferred from the AFS classification to the HTM\nclassification as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. The transfers of securities were made at fair value at the\ntime of transfer. See further information in Note 4, “Securities” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company’s AFS securities portfolio comprised 53.3% of the Company’s investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2023, compared to 52.9%\nat December 31, 2022. The Company’s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities.\nThis liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities\n40\nportfolio decreased from 62.3 months at December 31, 2022 to 52.6 months at December 31, 2023. In addition to providing a potential source of liquidity, the\nAFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company’s goal in the management of its AFS securities portfolio is to\nmaximize return within the Company’s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk and credit risk.\nManagement expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in\nthe level of AFS securities. There were $10.1 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits,\nderivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private\nplacement bonds. The Company’s HTM portfolio, net of the ACL totaled $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $170.6 million from December\n31, 2022. The average life of the HTM portfolio was 8.4 years at December 31, 2023, compared to 9.3 years at December 31, 2022.\nThe securities portfolio generates the Company’s second largest component of interest income. The AFS, HTM, and Other securities portfolios achieved\nan average yield on a tax-equivalent basis of 2.66% for 2023, compared to 2.33% in 2022. Securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss of $624.2\nmillion at year-end, compared to a net unrealized loss of $771.6 million the preceding year. This market value change primarily reflects the impact of a shorter\naverage life and increasing market interest rates as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. These amounts are reflected, on an after-tax basis,\nin the Company’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity, as an unrealized loss of $471.9 million at year-end 2023, compared\nto an unrealized loss of $514.6 million for 2022. The AFS securities portfolio contains securities that have unrealized losses (see the table of these securities in\nNote 4, “Securities,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The unrealized losses in the Company’s investments were caused by changes in\ninterest rates, and not from a decline in credit of the underlying issuers. The U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and Government Sponsored Entity (GSE) mortgage-\nbacked securities are all considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest rates caused by changing economic conditions.\nThe Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be\nimpacted by changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not believe the decline in value in these portfolios is related to credit\nimpairments and instead is due to increasing market interest rates. For the State and political subdivision portfolio, the majority of the Company’s holdings are\nin general obligation bonds, which have a very low historical default rate due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. For the\nState and political, Corporates, and Collateralized loan obligations portfolios, the Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-\npurchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis.

Equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values are generally carried at cost less impairment. Unrealized gains or losses on equity securities with and without readily\ndeterminable fair values are recognized in the Investment Securities gains, net line of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor further information on the Company’s investment securities, refer to Note 4, “Securities,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Earning Assets\nFederal funds transactions essentially are overnight loans between financial institutions, which allow for either the daily investment of excess funds or\nthe daily borrowing of another institution’s funds in order to meet short-term liquidity needs. The net borrowed position was $8.8 million at December 31, 2023\ncompared to $55.5 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe Bank buys and sells federal funds as agent for non-affiliated banks. Because the transactions are pursuant to agency arrangements, these\ntransactions do not appear on the balance sheet and averaged $192.6 million in 2023 and $262.9 million in 2022.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held securities purchased under agreements to resell of $240.3 million compared to $951.6 million at December\n31, 2022. The Company uses these instruments as short-term secured investments, in lieu of selling federal funds, or to acquire securities required for collateral\npurposes. Balances will fluctuate based on the Company’s liquidity and investment decisions as well as the Company’s correspondent bank borrowing levels.\nThese investments averaged $310.5 million in 2023 and $959.2 million in 2022.\nThe Company also maintains an active securities trading inventory. The average holdings in the securities trading inventory in 2023 were $14.0 million,\ncompared to $12.1 million in 2022, and were recorded at fair market value. As discussed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk –\nTrading Account” in Part II, Item 7A, the Company offsets the trading account securities by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the\ntrading account and futures contracts marked to market daily.\nInterest-bearing due from banks totaled $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and includes amounts\ndue from the FRB and interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions. The amount due from the FRB averaged $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion during\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the FRB balance at December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due\nto an increase in deposit balances. The interest-bearing accounts held at other financial institutions totaled $78.7 million and $121.7 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDeposits and Borrowed Funds\nDeposits represent the Company’s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company’s retail branch\nstructure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its asset management and mutual fund servicing businesses in order to\nattract and retain additional core deposits. Deposits totaled $35.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and $32.6 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $3.2\nbillion, or 9.7%. There were $1.9 billion of brokered deposits as of December 31, 2023. Deposits averaged $31.8 billion in 2023, and $31.3 billion in 2022.\n44\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits averaged $10.6 billion in 2023 and $13.3 billion in 2022. These deposits represented 33.5% of average deposits in\n2023, compared to 42.3% in 2022. The Company’s large commercial customer base provides a significant source of noninterest-bearing deposits. Many of\nthese commercial accounts do not earn interest; however, they receive an earnings credit to offset the cost of other services provided by the Company.\nTable 14\nMATURITIES OF UNINSURED TIME DEPOSITS (in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nMaturing within 3 months $ 445,239 $ 389,367\nAfter 3 months but within 6 months 65,985 39,651\nAfter 6 months but within 12 months 44,077 28,446\nAfter 12 months 21,384 9,837\nTotal $ 576,685 $ 467,301\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were an estimated $24.4 billion of uninsured deposits, as compared to $24.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Estimated\nuninsured deposits comprised approximately 68.2% and 75.5% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. A portion of\nthese uninsured deposits represent affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on deposit at UMB Bank, n.a. Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits\nthat are collateralized by high quality securities within the investment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of $2.0 billion and collateralized deposits of $6.2\nbillion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding\naffiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 45.3% and 51.0% as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC\ninsurance coverage. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.2 billion of deposits in the program.\nTable 15\nANALYSIS OF AVERAGE DEPOSITS (in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAmount:\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 10,640,344 $ 13,264,146\nInterest-bearing demand and savings 18,374,884 17,332,972\nTime deposits under $250,000 1,967,028 95,013\nTotal core deposits 30,982,256 30,692,131\nTime deposits of $250,000 or more 780,393 635,513\nTotal deposits $ 31,762,649 $ 31,327,644\nAs a % of total deposits:\nNoninterest-bearing demand 33.5% 42.4%\nInterest-bearing demand and savings 57.8 55.3\nTime deposits under $250,000 6.2 0.3\nTotal core deposits 97.5 98.0\nTime deposits of $250,000 or more 2.5 2.0\nTotal deposits 100.0% 100.0%\n45\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which it believes promotes investor confidence, provides\naccess to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company’s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher\nlevels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets, and higher expenses for\nextended liability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary’s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as\nregulatory requirements.\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $433.3 million, or 16.2% to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in\nshareholders’ equity from 2022 to 2023 is largely due to increases in retained earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the\ndecrease in unrealized losses on the securities portfolio.\nThe Board authorized, at its April 26, 2022, and April 27, 2021 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company’s common stock\nduring the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). On July 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved the\nrepurchase of up to one million shares of the Company's common stock, which will terminate on April 30, 2024. During 2023, the Company did not repurchase\nshares of common stock pursuant to any of its announced Repurchase Authorizations. In 2022, the Company acquired 333,185 shares of its common stock\npursuant to the applicable Repurchase Authorizations. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other than pursuant to the Repurchase\nAuthorizations.\nRisk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial\ninstitution’s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of\ncommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution’s total capital is also\nrequired to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets.\nThe risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit\nand binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk\nweightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is tier 1 core capital to total average\nassets less goodwill and intangibles. The Company's capital position as of December 31, 2023 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory\nrequirements.\nTable 16\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL (in thousands)\nThis table computes risk-based capital in accordance with current regulatory guidelines. These guidelines as of December 31, 2023, excluded net\nunrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale and net unrealized losses on securities held to maturity transferred from the available-for-sale\ncategory from the computation of regulatory capital and the related risk-based capital ratios.\nRisk-Weighted Category\n0% 20% 50% 100% 150% Total\nRisk-Weighted Assets\nLoans held for sale $ — $ — $ 4,420 $ — $ — $ 4,420\nLoans and leases 81,742 64,087 2,541,783 20,432,420 52,452 23,172,484\nSecurities available for sale 2,570,383 4,733,221 7,188 382,068 — 7,692,860\nSecurities held to maturity 443,410 4,223,292 1,232,352 — — 5,899,054\nFederal funds and resell agreements — 5,000 — — — 5,000\nTrading securities 881 1,738 13,482 1,992 — 18,093\nCash and due from banks 5,174,791 432,212 — — — 5,607,003\nAll other assets 35,273 74,400 34,830 1,842,449 — 1,986,952\nCategory totals $ 8,306,480 $ 9,533,950 $ 3,834,055 $ 22,658,929 $ 52,452 $ 44,385,866\nRisk-weighted totals $ — $ 1,906,790 $ 1,917,028 $ 22,658,929 $ 78,678 $ 26,561,425\nOff-balance-sheet items (3) — 49,306 58,953 4,567,880 15,125 4,691,264\nTotal risk-weighted assets $ — $ 1,956,096 $ 1,975,981 $ 27,226,809 $ 93,803 $ 31,252,689\n46\nTotal\nRegulatory Capital\nShareholders’ equity $ 3,100,419\nLess adjustments (1) 318,257\nCommon equity Tier 1/Tier 1 capital 3,418,676\nAdditional Tier 2 capital (2) 596,234\nTotal capital $ 4,014,910\nCompany\nCapital ratios\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.94%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.94%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets 12.85%\nLeverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total average assets less adjustments (1)) 8.49%\n(1) Adjustments include a portion of goodwill and intangibles as well as unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities, cash flow hedges, and the\nimpact of the Company’s election to use the five-year CECL transition.\n(2) Includes the Company’s ACL (inclusive of the reserve for off-balance sheet arrangements), subordinated long-term debt, and trust preferred subordinated\nnotes.\n(3) After credit conversion factor and risk weighting is applied.\nFor further discussion of regulatory capital requirements, see Note 10, “Regulatory Requirements” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements under Item 8.\nRepurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for securities by the Company, under an agreement\nto repurchase the same issues at an agreed-upon price and date.

The Company’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the\nCompany places at the FHLB.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had one short-term advance for $1.0 billion outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines. Additionally, in 2023, the\nFHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit expired in January 2024 and\nwas subsequently renewed with an expiration date in July 2024. The Company had no outstanding advances at FHLB Des Moines as of December 31, 2022.\nBased on the collateral pledged, the Company had $975.3 million of borrowing capacity remaining at the FHLB at December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's Bank Term Funding\nProgram (BTFP). As of December 31, 2023, the Company's borrowing capacity with the BTFP was $5.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Reserve Discount Window was $10.5 billion.\nIn addition to the borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional\nliquidity of $7.9 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of December 31, 2023.\nTo enhance general working capital needs, the Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to\nborrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company’s option, either 1.40%\nabove SOFR or 1.75% below the\n47\nprime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit. The Company had no\nadvances outstanding at December 31, 2023.\nLong-term debt totaled $383.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $381.3 million at December 31, 2022. In September 2022, the Company\nissued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts\nand commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, among other uses, contributing Tier\n1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective rate of 6.64% due to issuance costs, with an\ninterest rate reset date of September 2027.\nIn September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million,\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective\nrate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025.\nThe remainder of the Company’s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies in 2015 and consists of debt\nobligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital Trust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust\nIV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-term debt obligations had an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million and had a carrying\nvalue of $75.6 million at December 31, 2023 and $74.6 million at December 31, 2022. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month\nterm SOFR with spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from\nJanuary 2036 to September 2036. For further information on long-term debt refer to Note 9, “Borrowed Funds,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nThe Company has material off-balance sheet arrangements in the form of loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts\nand forward exchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. These commitments and contingent liabilities are not required to be\nrecorded on the Company’s balance sheet. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the\namounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. See Table 17 below, as well as Note 15, “Commitments, Contingencies\nand Guarantees” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for detailed information and further discussion of these arrangements.\nManagement does not anticipate any material losses from its off-balance sheet arrangements.\nTable 17\nCOMMITMENTS, MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (in thousands)\nThe table below details the commitments, material cash requirements, and off-balance sheet arrangements for the Company as of December 31, 2023\nand includes principal payments only.

See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits.\nFor further discussion of capital and liquidity, see the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk – Liquidity Risk” in Item 7A of this\nreport.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these\nConsolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\ndisclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and suppliers, allowance for credit\nlosses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments\non historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for\nmaking such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or\nconditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates.\nManagement believes that the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those relating to the allowance for credit losses.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company’s ACL represents management’s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company’s assets held at amortized cost. The\nCompany’s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company’s lifetime historical loss experience, management’s understanding of the\ncredit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.\nA mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management’s recorded ACL. To develop\nthe estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized\ncost, which include the Company’s loan and held-to-maturity security portfolios.\nThe estimation process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors\nhave been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed\nto produce a lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that is based on evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable\nand supportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy\nStatement. This process allows management\n49\nto take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered in its estimate.\nThe Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive\nmethodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company’s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the\nCompany’s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of\neconomic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s).\nBased on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant\nadjustments to estimated credit losses.\nThe ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management’s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the\nloan and held-to-maturity security portfolios considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss\nover the contractual term of the instrument. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the ACL is\ndependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control, including the performance of its portfolios, the economy, and changes in interest rates. As\nsuch, significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise,\nan upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could\nhave a significant impact on the Company’s Provision for credit losses and ACL reported in its Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance\nSheets, respectively.\nFor more information on loan portfolio segments, the Company’s ACL methodology, and management’s assumptions in estimating the ACL, refer to the\nsection captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” within Note 3, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n50\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management\nMarket risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the\nresult of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange prices, commodity prices, or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market\nrisk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading.\nThe Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The\nfollowing discussion of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the\ninstruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company’s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. To minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and\nexposure levels to economic losses, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines\nestablished by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board. The ALCO is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with\nasset/liability management policies, including interest rate exposure. The Company’s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate\nrisk is the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis. The Company also uses a Net Portfolio Value model to measure market value risk under various rate\nchange scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific\npoints in time. On a limited basis, the Company uses hedges such as swaps, rate floors, and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on certain loans,\ntrading securities, trust preferred securities, and deposits. See further information in Note 17 “Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in the Notes to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverall, the Company attempts to manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an\nacceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability, liquidity, interest rate risk and credit risk.\nNet Interest Income Modeling\nThe Company’s primary interest rate risk tool, the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis, measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate\nchanges on net interest income and net interest margin. This analysis incorporates all of the Company’s assets and liabilities together with assumptions that\nreflect the current interest rate environment. Through these simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 200-basis-point upward\nor a 300-basis-point downward gradual change (e.g. ramp) and immediate change (e.g. shock) of market interest rates over a two-year period. In ramp\nscenarios, rates change gradually for a one-year period and remain constant in year two. In shock scenarios, rates change immediately and the change is\nsustained for the remainder of the two year scenario horizon. Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis,\nmanagement outlook and repricing strategies. Asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other\nmarket changes. The results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the\nsimulation results on a regular basis.\n51\nTable 18 shows the net interest income percentage increase or decrease over the next twelve- and twenty-four-month periods as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022 based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and a constant sized balance sheet with runoff being replaced.\nTable 18\nMARKET RISK\nHypothetical change in interest rate – Rate Ramp\nYear One Year Two\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(basis points) Percentage change Percentage change Percentage change Percentage change\n200 (0.7)% (1.1)% 4.2% 7.1%\n100 (0.3) (0.4) 2.2 3.6\nStatic — — — —\n(100) 0.3 0.4 (3.1) (3.8)\n(200) 0.9 n/a (5.7) n/a\n(300) 1.5 n/a (8.8) n/a\nHypothetical change in interest rate – Rate Shock\nYear One Year Two\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(basis points) Percentage change Percentage change Percentage change Percentage change\n200 3.1% 2.4% 7.4% 9.5%\n100 1.6 1.2 3.8 4.8\nStatic — — — —\n(100) (1.7) (1.3) (4.7) (5.0)\n(200) (2.8) n/a (9.3) n/a\n(300) (3.5) n/a (14.3) n/a\nThe Company is positioned relatively neutral to changes in interest rates in the next year. Net interest income is predicted to decrease in all upward rate\nramp scenarios and increase in all upward rate shock scenarios. In down rate scenarios, net interest income is predicted to increase in rate ramp scenarios and\ndecrease in rate shock scenarios. The largest change in net interest income relative to base in either rate ramp or rate shock scenarios is less than 4% in year one.\nIn year two, net interest income is predicted to rise in all increasing rate scenarios and decrease in falling rate scenarios. The Company’s ability to price deposits\nconsistent with its historical approach is a key assumption in these scenarios.\nRepricing Mismatch Analysis\nThe Company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest-bearing assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time. While a traditional repricing mismatch analysis (gap analysis) provides a\nsnapshot of interest rate risk, it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not, in fact, reprice at the\nsame time or the same degree. Also, it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income.\n52\nTable 19 is a static gap analysis, which presents the Company’s assets and liabilities, based on their repricing or maturity characteristics and reflecting\nprincipal amortization. Table 20 presents the break-out of fixed and variable rate loans by repricing or maturity characteristics for each loan class.\nTable 19\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (in millions)\n1-90 91-180 181-365 1-5 Over 5\nDays Days Days Total Years Years Total\nDecember 31, 2023 Earning assets\nLoans $ 14,520.2 $ 718.9 $ 1,252.4 $ 16,491.5 $ 4,983.0 $ 1,702.4 $ 23,176.9\nSecurities 2,105.2 598.3 557.6 3,261.1 5,141.9 4,850.5 13,253.5\nFederal funds sold and resell agreements 245.3 — — 245.3 — — 245.3\nOther 5,177.3 — — 5,177.3 0.6 — 5,177.9\nTotal earning assets $ 22,048.0 $ 1,317.2 $ 1,810.0 $ 25,175.2 $ 10,125.5 $ 6,552.9 $ 41,853.6\n% of total earning assets 52.7% 3.1% 4.3% 60.1% 24.2% 15.7% 100.0%\nFunding sources\nInterest-bearing demand and savings $ 20,588.6 $ — $ — $ 20,588.6 $ — $ — $ 20,588.6\nTime deposits 1,019.6 1,627.3 221.4 2,868.3 202.6 2.7 3,073.6\nFederal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 2,119.6 — — 2,119.6 — — 2,119.6\nShort term debt — 1,000.0 800.0 1,800.0 — — 1,800.0\nLong term debt 75.6 — — 75.6 307.6 — 383.2\nNoninterest-bearing sources 12,130.8 — — 12,130.8 — 1,757.8 13,888.6\nTotal funding sources $ 35,934.2 $ 2,627.3 $ 1,021.4 $ 39,582.9 $ 510.2 $ 1,760.5 $ 41,853.6\n% of total earning assets 85.9% 6.2% 2.4% 94.5% 1.3% 4.2% 100.0%\nInterest sensitivity gap $ (13,886.2) $ (1,310.1) $ 788.6 $ (14,407.7) $ 9,615.3 $ 4,792.4\nCumulative gap (13,886.2) (15,196.3) (14,407.7) (14,407.7) (4,792.4) —\nAs a % of total earning assets (33.2)% (36.3)% (34.4)% (34.4)% (11.5)% —%\nRatio of earning assets to funding sources 0.61 0.50 1.77 0.64 19.85 3.72\nCumulative ratio of earning assets to funding sources\n2023 0.61 0.61 0.64 0.64 0.88 1.00\n2022 0.59 0.63 0.68 0.68 0.92 1.00\nTable 20\nMaturities and Sensitivities to Changes in Interest Rates\nThis table details loan maturities by variable and fixed rates as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nDue after Due after\none year five years\nDue in one through five through Due after\nyear or less years fifteen years fifteen years Total\nVariable Rate\nCommercial and industrial $ 7,056,626 $ 35,780 $ 171 $ 2,480 $ 7,095,057\nSpecialty lending 498,786 — — — 498,786\nCommercial real estate 5,329,868 176,617 7,459 14 5,513,958\nConsumer real estate 444,067 484,648 319,043 — 1,247,758\nConsumer 58,787 14 — — 58,801\nCredit cards 423,502 454 — — 423,956\nLeases and other 251,727 743 28 — 252,498\nTotal variable rate loans 14,063,363 698,256 326,701 2,494 15,090,814\nFixed Rate\nCommercial and industrial 988,753 1,685,457 160,662 — 2,834,872\nSpecialty lending — — — — —\nCommercial real estate 1,130,647 1,856,898 386,753 5,670 3,379,968\nConsumer real estate 241,581 658,767 629,616 187,330 1,717,294\nConsumer 58,085 44,976 1,278 151 104,490\nCredit cards — — — — —\nLeases and other 9,127 38,626 1,713 — 49,466\nTotal fixed rate loans 2,428,193 4,284,724 1,180,022 193,151 8,086,090\nTotal loans and loans held for sale $ 16,491,556 $ 4,982,980 $ 1,506,723 $ 195,645 $ 23,176,904\n53\n\nTrading Account\nThe Bank carries taxable governmental securities in a trading account that is maintained in accordance with Board-approved policy and procedures. The\npolicy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account and requires compliance with any limits under applicable law and\nregulations and mandates the use of a value-at-risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters. The risk associated with the\ncarrying of trading securities is offset by the sale of exchange-traded financial futures contracts, with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to\nmarket daily. This account had a balance of $18.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $18.0 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The\ndiscussion in Table 19 above of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading, because\nthe instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company’s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.\nOther Market Risk\nThe Company has minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts. See Note 10, “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees”\nin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. The Company utilizes a centralized\ncredit administration function, which provides information on the Bank’s risk levels, delinquencies, an internal risk grading system and overall credit exposure.\nLoan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards. In addition, the Company has an internal loan review\nstaff that operates independently of the Bank. This review team performs periodic examinations of the Bank’s loans for credit quality, documentation and loan\nadministration. The respective regulatory authority of the Bank also reviews loan portfolios.\nA primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and\nrestructured loans on nonaccrual. The Company’s nonperforming loans decreased $6.1 million to $13.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to December\n31, 2022. There was an immaterial amount of interest recognized on nonperforming loans during 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nThe Company had $1.7 million and $68 thousand of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Loans past\ndue more than 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $1.6 million as of December 31, 2022.\nA loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90 days or more and/or when management has considerable doubt about the\nborrower’s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in\ncash.\nCertain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective\nborrowers. The Company had $548 thousand of restructured loans at December 31, 2023 and $5.2 million at December 31, 2022.\n54\nTable 21\nLOAN QUALITY (in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nNonaccrual loans $ 12,828 $ 16,838\nRestructured loans on nonaccrual 384 2,431\nTotal non-performing loans 13,212 19,269\nOther real estate owned 1,738 68\nTotal non-performing assets $ 14,950 $ 19,337\nLoans past due 90 days or more $ 3,111 $ 1,617\nRestructured loans accruing 164 2,790\nAllowance for credit losses on loans 219,738 191,836\nRatios\nNon-performing loans as a % of loans 0.06% 0.09%\nNon-performing assets as a % of loans plus other real estate owned 0.06 0.09\nNon-performing assets as a % of total assets 0.03 0.05\nLoans past due 90 days or more as a % of loans 0.01 0.01\nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a % of loans 0.95 0.91\nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a multiple of non-performing loans 16.63x 9.96x\nTable 22\nSUMMARY OF NET CHARGE-OFFS (in thousands)\n2023 2022\nNet Charge- Net Charge-\nOffs Offs\n(Recoveries) (Recoveries)\nNet Charge- Average to Average Net Charge- Average to Average\nOffs Loans Loans Offs Loans Loans\n(Recoveries) Outstanding Outstanding (Recoveries) Outstanding Outstanding\nAt December 31:\nCommercial and industrial $ (248) $ 9,669,378 (0.00)% $ 35,719 $ 8,160,147 0.44%\nSpecialty lending 761 540,371 0.14 (433) 525,697 (0.08)\nCommercial real estate 155 8,359,937 0.00 (356) 6,784,082 (0.01)\nConsumer real estate 1,140 2,858,510 0.04 (74) 2,512,597 (0.00)\nConsumer real estate 1,021 147,240 0.69 674 146,949 0.46\nCredit cards 7,645 478,328 1.60 4,338 431,003 1.01\nLeases and other — 281,178 — — 261,941 —\nTotal 22,334,94 18,822,41\n$ 10,474 $ 2 0.05% $ 39,868 $ 6 0.21%\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $10.5 million, compared to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity represents the Company’s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional\nfunds. The Company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and\ngrowth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, the Company believes public confidence is generated through profitable\noperations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity\nof assets, which include $7.1 billion of high-quality securities available for sale. The liquidity of the Company and the Bank is also enhanced by its activity in\nthe federal funds market and by its core deposits. Additionally, management believes it can raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms in the future, should\nthe need arise.\nAnother factor affecting liquidity is the amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements. All customer\nrepurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security. The U.S.\n55\nGovernment, other public entities, and certain trust depositors require the Company to pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the FDIC-\ninsured deposit limitations. These pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the related security cannot otherwise be disposed due to the pledging\nrestriction. At December 31, 2023, $10.1 billion, or 79.2%, of securities were pledged or used as collateral, compared to $10.3 billion, or 80.3%, at December\n31, 2022.\nThe Company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity. These commitments include unused commitments to extend credit,\nstandby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The total amount of these commercial commitments at December 31, 2023\nwas $17.5 billion. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily\nrepresent the future cash requirements of the Company.\nThe Company’s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, operating expenses, and treasury stock purchases.\nManagement fees and dividends received from bank and non-bank subsidiaries traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected\nto be sufficient in the future. The Bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the Company. For the most part, the Bank can pay\ndividends at least equal to its current year’s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval. The Company also uses cash to inject capital into the Bank and\nits non-Bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as to fund strategic initiatives.\nIn September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9\nmillion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective\nrate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027.\nIn September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million,\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective\nrate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025.\nTo enhance general working capital needs, the Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to\nborrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company’s option, either 1.4%\nabove Term SOFR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line\nof credit. The Company had no advances outstanding at December 31, 2023.\nThe Company is a member bank with the FHLB of Des Moines, and through this relationship, the Company owns $55.2 million of FHLB stock and has\naccess to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the\nCompany places at the FHLB. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had one short-term advance for $1.0 billion outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines.\nAdditionally, in 2023, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure deposits. This letter of credit\nexpired in January 2024. The Company had no outstanding advances at FHLB Des Moines as of December 31, 2022. Based on the collateral pledged, the\nCompany had $975.3 million of borrowing capacity remaining at the FHLB at December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's BTFP. As of December\n31, 2023, the Company's borrowing capacity with the BTFP was $5.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window\nwas $10.5 billion.\nIn addition to the borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional\nliquidity of $7.9 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of December 31, 2023.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by\nthird parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by\n56\nemployees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing,\nbreaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal\nor regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nThe Company operates in many markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions. In the\nevent of a breakdown in internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face\nregulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation. In order to address this risk, management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of\nproviding proper transaction authorization and execution, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data.\nThe Company maintains systems of internal controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the Company’s operations.\nThese systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company’s financial strength, the environment in which it\noperates, and considering factors such as competition and regulation. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies\nrelating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis. In certain cases, the Company has experienced losses from operational risk.\nSuch losses have included the effects of operational errors that the Company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income. While there\ncan be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls,\nsystems and corporate-wide processes and procedures.\n57\nITEM 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for credit losses on certain loans evaluated on a collective basis\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total allowance for credit losses on loans was $219.7 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, a substantial portion of which related to the allowance for credit losses for loans evaluated on a collective basis for the commercial\nand industrial and commercial real estate segments (the collective ACL). The collective ACL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a pool basis\nfor loans where similar risk characteristics exist and is determined using relevant available information from internal and external sources related to\nhistorical credit loss experience, current\n58\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The Company uses probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) models for\nthe commercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments. For the commercial and industrial segment, the collective ACL is calculated by\nmodeling PD over future periods multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any modeled prepayments and charge\noffs. For the commercial real estate segment, the collective ACL is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data. The PD loss\nrate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any modeled prepayments and charge offs. Primary risk\ndrivers are segment specific and include macro-economic variables and risk ratings of the individual loans within the commercial and industrial and\ncommercial real estate loan segments. After the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, the Company reverts to historical loss experience for each\nportfolio using a cliff or straight-line reversion method. A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative factors which represent adjustments to\nhistorical loss experience.\nWe identified the assessment of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and\nsubjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation\nof the collective ACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and historical loss rates and their significant\nassumptions, including average prepayment rates, the economic forecast scenario, macro-economic variables, the reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiods, lengths of time and methods of reversion, and risk ratings, and (2) the qualitative factors and their significant assumptions. The assessment also\nincluded an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness\nof certain internal controls related to the measurement of the collective ACL, including controls related to the:\n• design of the collective ACL methodology\n• continued use of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models\n• determination and measurement of the significant assumptions used in the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models\n• continued use of the qualitative factors\n• performance monitoring of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models\n• analysis of the overall ACL results, trends, and ratios.\nWe evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company\nused, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n• evaluating the Company’s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n• evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the continued use and performance monitoring of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate\nmodels by comparing them to relevant Company specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices\n• assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD and historical loss rate models by inspecting the model\ndocumentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use\n• evaluating the methodology used to develop the economic forecast scenario and underlying assumptions by comparing it to the Company’s business\nenvironment and relevant industry practices\n• testing the historical credit cycle period and evaluating the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period by comparing to specific portfolio\nrisk characteristics and trends\n59\n• testing individual risk ratings for a selection of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans by evaluating the financial performance of\nthe borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral\n• evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ACL compared with relevant credit\nrisk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 22, 2024\n60\nUMB FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(dollars

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUMB Financial Corporation is a bank holding company, which offers a wide range of banking and other financial services to its customers through its\nbranches and offices in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana,\nUtah, Minnesota, California, Wisconsin, Delaware, and New York. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies to assist the reader in\nunderstanding the financial presentation.\nConsolidation\nThe Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements (references hereinafter to the Company in these\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements include wholly owned subsidiaries). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest on loans and securities is recognized based on rate multiplied by the principal amount outstanding. This includes the impact of amortization of\npremiums and discounts. Interest accrual is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful. Noninterest\nincome is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include Cash and due from banks and amounts due from the FRB. Cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and\namounts due from correspondent banks are included in Cash and due from banks. Amounts due from the FRB are interest-bearing for all periods presented and\nare included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThis table provides a summary of cash and cash equivalents as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDue from the FRB $ 5,081,057 $ 1,057,192\nCash and due from banks 447,201 500,682\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 5,528,258 $ 1,557,874\nAlso included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line, but not considered cash and cash equivalents are interest-bearing accounts held at other\nfinancial institutions, which totaled $78.7 million and $121.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoans and Loans Held for Sale\nLoans are classified by the portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, specialty lending, commercial real estate, consumer real estate, consumer,\ncredit cards, and leases and other.\nA loan is considered to be collateral dependent when management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all principal and interest due\naccording to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is collateral dependent, the Company records a valuation allowance equal to the carrying amount of the\nloan in excess of the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective rate, based on the loan’s observable market price or the\nfair value of the collateral.\n67\nA loan is accounted for as a modification made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty when a modification has been granted that is deemed\nconcessionary and not temporary to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments,\nprincipal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their\nfinancial condition. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered to be collateral\ndependent and is evaluated for credit loss as part of the allowance for credit loss analysis.\nLoans, including those that are considered to be collateral dependent, are evaluated regularly by management. Loans are considered delinquent when\npayment has not been received within 30 days of its contractual due date. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal is\n90 days or more past due unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest\npreviously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts\ncontractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal\nunless the remaining principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible.\nThe adequacy of the ACL on loans is based on management’s judgment and continuous evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the credit quality\ninherent in the loan portfolio. Consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to each specific segmentation of loans includes lifetime historical\nloss experience, the impact of the current economic environment, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and detailed analysis of loans determined to be collateral\ndependent. The actual losses incurred over the lifetime of the portfolio, notwithstanding such considerations, however, could differ from the amounts estimated\nby management.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures, to address the credit risk to which the Company is exposed via a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure\nis included in the Accrued expenses and taxes line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In order to maintain the allowance for off-balance sheet items at an\nappropriate level, a provision to increase or reduce the allowance is included in the Provision for credit losses line item in the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Income. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit loss rates to the expected\namount to be funded.\nLoans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Loan fees (net of certain direct loan origination costs) on loans held for\nsale are deferred until the related loans are sold or repaid. Gains or losses on loan sales are recognized at the time of sale and determined using the specific\nidentification method.\nSecurities\nDebt securities available for sale principally include U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, GSE mortgage-backed securities, certain securities of state and\npolitical subdivisions, corporates, and collateralized loan obligations. Debt securities classified as available for sale are measured at fair value. Unrealized\nholding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in AOCI until realized.\nSecurities held to maturity are carried at amortized historical cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, based on management’s intention, and the\nCompany’s ability to hold them to maturity. The Company classifies certain U.S. Agency securities, GSE mortgage-backed securities, and securities of state\nand political subdivisions as held to maturity.\nTrading securities, acquired for subsequent sale to customers, are carried at fair value. Market adjustments, fees and gains or losses on the sale of trading\nsecurities are considered to be a normal part of operations and are included in trading and investment banking income.\nSecurities may be transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification when the Company has the positive intent\nand ability to hold these securities to maturity. Transfers of securities are made at fair value at the time of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the\ntime of transfer is retained in AOCI and amortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the\ntransferred securities. No gains or losses are recognized at the time of the transfer.\n68\nEquity-method investments\nThe Company accounts for certain other investments using equity-method accounting. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the\nCompany’s proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. When transparency in pricing exists, other investments are considered\nequity securities with readily determinable fair values.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company performs a qualitative assessment of each\nreporting unit. If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the\ncarrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required. Otherwise, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying\namounts to determine if an impairment exists and the amount of impairment loss. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of a\nreporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value.\nNo goodwill impairments were recognized in 2023, 2022, or 2021. Other intangible assets, which relate to core deposits, non-compete agreements, and\ncustomer relationships, are amortized over their useful life. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances dictate. No intangible\nasset impairments were recognized in 2023, 2022, or 2021. The Company does not have any indefinite lived intangible assets.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is computed primarily on the straight-line method. Premises are\ndepreciated over 15 to 40 year lives, while equipment is depreciated over lives of 3 to 20 years. Gains and losses from the sale of Premises and equipment are\nincluded in Other noninterest income and Other noninterest expense, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including Premises and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying\namount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by\nthe asset or group of assets to their current carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges), an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value. No impairments were recognized in 2023, 2022,\nor 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which\nthe differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The provision for deferred income taxes represents the change in the deferred income tax accounts during the year excluding the\ntax effect of the change in net unrealized gain (loss) on securities available for sale and certain derivative items.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent these assets will more likely than not be realized. All available evidence is considered in making\nsuch determination, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent\nfinancial operations. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portion of deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized, and any changes to\nthe valuation allowance are recorded in income tax expense.\nThe Company records the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that it will\nbe sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recorded as the largest amount of tax\nbenefit that is greater than 50\n69\npercent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in\nwhich it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained. The benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax positions are generally\nrecognized in the first period in which the more-likely-than-not threshold is met at the reporting date, the tax matter is ultimately settled through negotiation or\nlitigation, or when the related statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired. The recognition,\nderecognition and measurement of tax positions are based on management’s best judgment given the facts, circumstance and information available at the\nreporting date.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other noninterest expense. Accrued\ninterest and penalties are included within the related liability lines in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nhas recognized an immaterial amount in interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits.\nDerivatives\nThe Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndepends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting,\nand whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Currently, five of the Company’s derivatives are designated\nin qualifying hedging relationships. The remainder of the Company’s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships, as the derivatives are\nnot used to manage risks within the Company’s assets or liabilities. All changes in fair value of the Company’s non-designated derivatives and fair value hedges\nare recognized directly in earnings. Changes in fair value of the Company’s cash flow hedges are recognized in AOCI and are reclassified to earnings when the\nhedged transaction affects earnings.\nPer Share Data\nBasic income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted year-to-\ndate income per share includes the dilutive effect of 260,177, 406,477, and 466,830 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and nonvested restricted\nstock units granted by the Company that were outstanding at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nCertain options and restricted stock units issued under employee benefit plans were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because\nthey were anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there were 55,649 outstanding stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were\nno outstanding stock options or restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on\nthe date of the grant. For stock options, restricted stock, and service-based restricted stock unit awards, the grant date fair value is estimated using either an\noption-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or an observed market price, if such a price exists. For performance-based restricted stock\nunit awards, the grant date fair value is based on the quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends\nnot received during the vesting period. Such cost is generally recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in\nexchange for the award and, in some cases, when performance metrics are met. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based compensation on an actual\nbasis as they occur.\n2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nTroubled Debt Restructurings In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures.” The ASU eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) by creditors and enhances disclosure requirements\nfor certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments\n70\nalso added requirements to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases, disclosed by\ncredit-quality indicator and class of financing receivable. The amendments in this update were adopted prospectively on January 1, 2023. The adoption of the\namendments had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional and revised financial statement disclosures. See Note 3, \"Loans and\nAllowance for Credit Losses\" for related disclosures.\nIncome Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The ASU is\nintended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update require additional disclosures primarily\nrelated to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from\nadditional disclosures.\n3. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nLoan Origination/Risk Management\nThe Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to minimize the level of risk within the loan portfolio.\nDiversification of the loan portfolio manages the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Authority levels are established for the extension of\ncredit to ensure consistency throughout the Company. It is necessary that policies, processes, and practices implemented to control the risks of individual credit\ntransactions and portfolio segments are sound and adhered to. The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the\nrisk assessment on a continual basis. Management regularly evaluates the results of the loan reviews. The loan review process complements and reinforces the\nrisk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company’s policies and procedures.\nCommercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its\nbusiness. Commercial loans are made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash\nflows of the borrower, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by\nthe assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee. In the case of loans\nsecured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect\namounts from its customers.\nSpecialty lending loans include Asset-based loans, which are offered primarily in the form of revolving lines of credit to commercial borrowers that do\nnot generally qualify for traditional bank financing. Asset-based loans are underwritten based primarily upon the value of the collateral pledged to secure the\nloan, rather than on the borrower’s general financial condition. The Company utilizes pre-loan due diligence techniques, monitoring disciplines, and loan\nmanagement practices common within the asset-based lending industry to underwrite loans to these borrowers.\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans.\nThese loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher\nloan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business\nconducted on the property securing the loan. The Company requires that an appraisal of the collateral be made at origination and on an as-needed basis, in\nconformity with current market conditions and regulatory requirements. The underwriting standards address both owner and non-owner-occupied real estate.\nAlso included in Commercial real estate are Construction loans that are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis\nor absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value\nassociated with the complete project. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the\nsuccess of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim\nloan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have\nhigher risks than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, economic\nconditions, completion of the construction project, and the availability of long-term financing.\n71\nConsumer real estate loans, including residential real estate and home equity loans, are underwritten based on the borrower’s loan-to-value percentage,\ncollection remedies, and overall credit history.\nConsumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer loans and\nleases. The underwriting and review practices combined with the relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes\nrisk. Consumer loans and leases that are 90 days past due or more are considered non-performing.\nCredit cards include both commercial and consumer credit cards. Commercial credit cards are generally unsecured and are underwritten with criteria\nsimilar to commercial loans, including an analysis of the borrower’s cash flow, available business capital, and overall creditworthiness of the borrower.\nConsumer credit cards are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer credit cards\nand periodically reviews the distribution of credit scores relative to historical periods to monitor credit risk on its consumer credit card loans.\nCredit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure. Credit risk is mitigated with formal risk\nmanagement practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process. Control factors or\ntechniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor’s financial capacity, and monitoring\nthe client’s activities. Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average risk ratings, and other aggregate\ncharacteristics.\nLoan Aging Analysis\nThe following tables provide a summary of loan classes and an aging of past due loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nGreater\n30-89 than 90\nDays Past Days Past\nDue and Due and Nonaccrual Total Total\nAccruing Accruing Loans Past Due Current Loans\nLoans\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,851 $ — $ 7,033 $ 9,884 $ 9,920,045 $ 9,929,929\nSpecialty lending — — — — 498,786 498,786\nCommercial real estate 1,848 — 737 2,585 8,891,341 8,893,926\nConsumer real estate 1,137 — 5,058 6,195 2,954,437 2,960,632\nConsumer 104 55 28 187 163,104 163,291\nCredit cards 5,343 3,056 285 8,684 415,272 423,956\nLeases and other — — 71 71 301,893 301,964\nTotal loans $ 11,283 $ 3,111 $ 13,212 $ 27,606 $23,144,878 $23,172,484\nDecember 31, 2022\nGreater\n30-89 than 90\nDays Past Days Past\nDue and Due and Nonaccrual Total Total\nAccruing Accruing Loans Past Due Current Loans\nLoans\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,456 $ 2 $ 11,356 $ 13,814 $ 9,192,172 $ 9,205,986\nSpecialty lending — — — — 602,706 602,706\nCommercial real estate 2,167 191 2,505 4,863 7,611,223 7,616,086\nConsumer real estate 10 — 4,882 4,892 2,718,377 2,723,269\nConsumer 613 20 61 694 144,972 145,666\nCredit cards 3,529 1,404 441 5,374 426,298 431,672\nLeases and other — — 24 24 305,780 305,804\nTotal loans $ 8,775 $ 1,617 $ 19,269 $ 29,661 $21,001,528 $21,031,189\n72\nThe Company sold consumer real estate loans with proceeds of $67.9 million, $48.1 million, and $147.9 million in the secondary market without\nrecourse during the periods ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company has ceased the recognition of interest on loans with a carrying value of $13.2 million and $19.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Restructured loans totaled $548 thousand and $5.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Loans 90 days past due and still\naccruing interest amounted to $3.1 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The total amount of accrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost basis of loans presented\nabove. Further, the Company has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including\ntrends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans, net charge-offs, non-performing loans, and general economic conditions.\nThe Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate loans.\nChanges in credit risk are monitored on a continuous basis and changes in risk ratings are made when identified. The loan ratings are summarized into the\nfollowing categories: Non-watch list, Watch, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful. Any loan not classified in one of the categories described below is\nconsidered to be a Non-watch list loan. A description of the general characteristics of the loan rating categories is as follows:\n• Watch – This rating represents credit exposure that presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention by\nCompany personnel due to conditions affecting the borrower, the borrower’s industry, or the economic environment. These conditions\nhave resulted in some degree of uncertainty that results in higher-than-average credit risk. These loans are considered pass-rated credits.\n75\n• Special Mention – This rating reflects a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these\npotential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the borrower’s credit position at some future\ndate. The rating is not adversely classified and does not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.\n• Substandard – This rating represents an asset inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or\nof the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of\nthe debt. Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are\nnot corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets\nclassified as substandard.\n• Doubtful – This rating represents an asset that has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified as substandard, with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly\nquestionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending\nfactors, which may work to the advantage of strengthening the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact\nstatus may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, liquidation procedures, capital injection, or perfecting\nliens.\nCommercial and industrial\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial and industrial loans is included below:\nEquipment, accounts receivable, and inventory General commercial and industrial loans are secured by working capital assets and non-real estate\nassets. The general purpose of these loans is for financing capital expenditures and current operations for commercial and industrial entities. These assets are\nshort-term in nature. In the case of accounts receivable and inventories, the repayment of debt is reliant upon converting assets into cash or through goods and\nservices being sold and collected. Collateral-based risk is due to aged short-term assets, which can be indicative of underlying issues with the borrower and lead\nto the value of the collateral being overstated.\nAgriculture Agricultural loans are secured by non-real estate agricultural assets. These include shorter-term assets such as equipment, crops, and\nlivestock. The risks associated with loans to finance crops or livestock include the borrower’s ability to successfully raise and market the commodity. Adverse\nweather conditions and other natural perils can dramatically affect farmers’ or ranchers’ production and ability to service debt. Volatile commodity prices\npresent another significant risk for agriculture borrowers. Market price volatility and production cost volatility can affect both revenues and expenses.\nOverdrafts Commercial overdrafts are typically short-term and unsecured. Some commercial borrowers tie their overdraft obligation to their line of\ncredit, so any draw on the line of credit will satisfy the overdraft.\n76\nBased on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed\nfinancial position.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nAmortized Revolving\nCost - Loans\nRevolving Converted to\nRisk by Collateral 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans Term Loans Total\nEquipment/Accounts\nReceivable/Inventory\nNon-watch list – Pass $ 1,728,443 $ 1,381,481 $ 1,059,277 $ 402,632 $ 184,561 $ 92,979 $ 4,242,095 $ 6,194 $ 9,097,662\nWatch – Pass 38,940 81,233 55,928 8,809 9,620 1,627 230,990 49 427,196\nSpecial Mention 3,000 17,857 5,186 214 — — 39,059 — 65,316\nSubstandard 15,708 6,038 3,341 621 8,646 2,524 103,728 93 140,699\nDoubtful 1,210 — — — — — — — 1,210\nTotal Equipment/Accounts\nReceivable/Inventory $ 1,787,301 $ 1,486,609 $ 1,123,732 $ 412,276 $ 202,827 $ 97,130 $ 4,615,872 $ 6,336 $ 9,732,083\nAgriculture\nNon-watch list – Pass $ 13,934 $ 5,122 $ 3,785 $ 839 $ 477 $ 239 $ 159,565 $ — $ 183,961\nWatch – Pass — — — — — — — — —\nSpecial Mention — 66 — — — — 1,236 — 1,302\nSubstandard — 652 — 81 — — 8,372 — 9,105\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Agriculture $ 13,934 $ 5,840 $ 3,785 $ 920 $ 477 $ 239 $ 169,173 $ — $ 194,368\nDecember 31, 2022\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nAmortized Revolving\nCost - Loans\nRevolving Converted to\nRisk by Collateral 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior Loans Term Loans Total\nEquipment/Accounts\nReceivable/Inventory\nNon-watch list – Pass $ 2,079,002 $ 1,466,120 $ 588,562 $ 246,387 $ 90,656 $ 83,054 $ 3,879,709 $ 3,633 $ 8,437,123\nWatch – Pass 28,570 78,523 52,696 7,493 3,617 2,275 213,871 — 387,045\nSpecial Mention 4,072 5,637 1,178 — 1,817 899 34,631 — 48,234\nSubstandard 26,698 12,247 213 13,564 826 559 92,352 293 146,752\nDoubtful 2,267 — — — — — 2,795 — 5,062\nTotal Equipment/Accounts\nReceivable/Inventory $ 2,140,609 $ 1,562,527 $ 642,649 $ 267,444 $ 96,916 $ 86,787 $ 4,223,358 $ 3,926 $ 9,024,216\nAgriculture\nNon-watch list – Pass $ 12,252 $ 5,351 $ 1,693 $ 1,985 $ 396 $ 541 $ 137,759 $ — $ 159,977\nWatch – Pass 550 — 206 — — — 8,512 562 9,830\nSpecial Mention 828 64 147 — — — 1,539 — 2,578\nSubstandard — — — — — — 1,456 — 1,456\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Agriculture $ 13,630 $ 5,415 $ 2,046 $ 1,985 $ 396 $ 541 $ 149,266 $ 562 $ 173,841\nSpecialty lending\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Specialty loans is included below:\nAsset-based lending General asset-based loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate. The purpose of these loans is\nfor financing current operations for commercial customers. The repayment of debt is reliant upon collection of the accounts receivable within 30 to 90 days or\nconverting assets into cash or through goods and services being sold and collected. The Company tracks each individual borrower credit risk based on their loan\nto collateral position. Any borrower position where the underlying value of collateral is below the fair value of the loan is considered out-of-margin and\ninherently higher risk.\n77\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance by risk rating for asset-based loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nAsset-based lending\nRisk December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nIn-margin $ 498,786 $ 602,706\nOut-of-margin — —\nTotal $ 498,786 $ 602,706\nCommercial real estate\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial real estate loans is included below:\nOwner-occupied Owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple\neconomic cycles. The loans rely on the owner-occupied operations to service debt which cover a broad spectrum of industries. Real estate debt can carry a\nsignificant amount of leverage for a borrower to maintain.\nNon-owner-occupied Non-owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to\nmultiple economic cycles. The key element of risk in this type of lending is the cyclical nature of real estate markets. Although national conditions affect the\noverall real estate industry, the effect of national conditions on local markets is equally important. Factors such as unemployment rates, consumer demand,\nhousehold formation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas. In addition to geographic\nconsiderations, markets can be defined by property type. While all sectors are influenced by economic conditions, some sectors are more sensitive to certain\neconomic factors than others.\nFarmland Farmland loans are secured by real estate used for agricultural purposes such as crop and livestock production. Assets used as collateral are\nlong-term assets that carry the ability to have longer amortizations and maturities. Longer terms carry the risk of added susceptibility to market conditions. The\nlimited purpose of some Agriculture-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan\nrepayment problems emerge.\n5+ Multi-family 5+ multi-family loans are secured by a multi-family residential property. The primary risks associated with this type of collateral are\nlargely driven by economic conditions. The national and local market conditions can change with unemployment rates or competing supply of multi-family\nhousing. Tenants may not be able to afford their housing or have better options and this can result in increased vacancy. Rents may need to be lowered to fill\napartment units. Increased vacancy and lower rental rates not only drive the borrower’s ability to repay debt but also contribute to how the collateral is valued.\n1-4 Family construction 1-4 family construction loans are secured by 1-4 family residential real estate and are in the process of construction or\nimprovements being made. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a project on\ntime and within budget. Market conditions also play an important role in understanding the risk profile. Risk from adverse changes in market conditions from\nthe start of development to completion can result in deflated collateral values.\nGeneral construction General construction loans are secured by commercial real estate in process of construction or improvements being made and\ntheir repayment is dependent on the collateral’s completion. Construction lending presents unique risks not encountered in term financing of existing real estate.\nThe predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a project on time and within budget.\nCommercial properties under construction are susceptible to market and economic conditions. Demand from prospective customers may erode after\nconstruction begins because of a general economic slowdown or an increase in the supply of competing properties.\nBased on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed\nfinancial position.\n78\nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year -

The primary risk is the borrower’s inability to repay debt.\nRevolving notes are often associated with HELOCs that can be secured by real estate without a 1st lien priority. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility\nimpacting home values or economic downturns.\nFirst lien: 1-4 family First lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a first lien on 1-4 family residential property. These term loans carry longer maturities\nand amortizations. The longer tenure exposes the borrower to multiple economic cycles, coupled with longer amortizations that result in smaller principal\nreduction early in the life of the loan. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values.\nJunior lien: 1-4 family Junior lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a junior lien on 1-4 family residential property. The Company’s primary risk is the\nborrower’s inability to repay debt and not being in a first lien position. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic\ndownturns.\nA borrower is considered non-performing if the Company has ceased the recognition of interest and the loan is placed on non-accrual. Charge-offs and\nborrower performance are tracked on a loan origination vintage basis. Certain vintages, based on their maturation cycle, could be at higher risk due to collateral-\nbased risk factors.\n80\nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nAmortized Revolving\nCost - Loans\nRevolving Converted to\nRisk by Collateral 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans Term Loans Total\nHELOC\nPerforming $ 150 $ 579 $ — $ 466 $ 82 $ 3,737 $ 355,047 $ 1,308 $ 361,369\nNon-performing — 71 — 31 — 1,221 58 56 1,437\nTotal HELOC $ 150 $ 650 $ — $ 497 $ 82 $ 4,958 $ 355,105 $ 1,364 $ 362,806\nFirst lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming $ 418,766 $ 583,711 $ 681,921 $ 548,736 $ 158,037 $ 164,315 $ 2 $ — $ 2,555,488\nNon-performing 546 1,690 87 123 191 882 — — 3,519\nTotal First lien: 1-4 family $ 419,312 $ 585,401 $ 682,008 $ 548,859 $ 158,228 $ 165,197 $ 2 $ — $ 2,559,007\nJunior lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming $ 12,094 $ 11,911 $ 6,861 $ 3,927 $ 2,117 $ 1,722 $ 85 $ — $ 38,717\nNon-performing 23 32 — — — 47 — — 102\nTotal Junior lien: 1-4 family $ 12,117 $ 11,943 $ 6,861 $ 3,927 $ 2,117 $ 1,769 $ 85 $ — $ 38,819\nDecember 31, 2022\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nAmortized Revolving\nCost - Loans\nRevolving Converted to\nRisk by Collateral 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior Loans Term Loans Total\nHELOC\nPerforming $ 120 $ — $ 592 $ 90 $ 148 $ 3,919 $ 338,979 $ 759 $ 344,607\nNon-performing 117 — 26 134 506 1,470 87 222 2,562\nTotal HELOC $ 237 $ — $ 618 $ 224 $ 654 $ 5,389 $ 339,066 $ 981 $ 347,169\nFirst lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming $ 628,678 $ 748,269 $ 607,055 $ 173,061 $ 45,907 $ 138,764 $ 12 $ — $ 2,341,746\nNon-performing 25 93 50 405 — 1,679 — — 2,252\nTotal First lien: 1-4 family $ 628,703 $ 748,362 $ 607,105 $ 173,466 $ 45,907 $ 140,443 $ 12 $ — $ 2,343,998\nJunior lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming $ 13,490 $ 8,445 $ 5,107 $ 2,529 $ 940 $ 1,437 $ 87 $ — $ 32,035\nNon-performing — — — — — 67 — — 67\nTotal Junior lien: 1-4 family $ 13,490 $ 8,445 $ 5,107 $ 2,529 $ 940 $ 1,504 $ 87 $ — $ 32,102\nConsumer\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer loans is included below:\nRevolving line Consumer Revolving lines of credit are secured by consumer assets other than real estate.

The primary risk associated with this collateral class is credit card debt\nis generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay. The highly competitive environment for\ncredit card lending provides consumers with ample opportunity to hold several credit cards from different issuers and to pay only minimum monthly payments\non outstanding balances. In such an environment, borrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a\npersonal catastrophic event.\nThe consumer credit card portfolio is segmented by borrower payment activity. Transactors are defined as accounts that pay off their balance by the end\nof each statement cycle. Revolvers are defined as an account that carries a balance from statement cycle to the next. These accounts incur monthly finance\ncharges, and, sometimes, late fees. Revolvers are inherently higher risk and are tracked by credit score.\nCommercial Commercial credit card loans are revolving loans made to small and commercial businesses. The primary risk associated with this\ncollateral class is credit card debt is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay. Borrowers\nmay become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a catastrophic event.\nThe commercial credit card portfolio is segmented by current and past due payment status. A borrower is past due after 30 days. In general, commercial\ncredit card customers do not have incentive to hold a balance resulting in paying interest on credit card debt as commercial customers will typically have other\ndebt obligations with lower interest rates in which they can utilize for capital.\n82\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance of consumer credit cards by risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nConsumer\nRisk December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nTransactor accounts $ 74,330 $ 73,670\nRevolver accounts (by Credit score):\nLess than 600 7,140 4,684\n600-619 3,572 2,515\n620-639 5,343 4,959\n640-659 9,536 8,655\n660-679 9,642 9,593\n680-699 11,220 12,023\n700-719 13,489 14,098\n720-739 12,896 15,036\n740-759 12,434 13,638\n760-779 12,955 13,768\n780-799 11,822 13,172\n800-819 7,808 9,257\n820-839 4,054 4,363\n840+ 854 917\nTotal $ 197,095 $ 200,348\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance of commercial credit cards by risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nCommercial\nRisk December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCurrent $ 207,520 $ 219,558\nPast Due 19,341 11,766\nTotal $ 226,861 $ 231,324\nLeases and other\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Leases and other loans is included below:\nLeases Leases are either loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures or are loans related to all other direct financing and\nleveraged leases on property for leasing to lessees other than for household, family, and other personal expenditure purposes. All leases are secured by the lease\nbetween the lessor and the lessee. These assignments grant the creditor a security interest in the rent stream from any lease, an important source of cash to pay\nthe note in case of the borrower’s default.\nOther Other loans are loans that are obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S., loans to non-depository financial institutions, loans for\npurchasing or carrying securities, or all other non-consumer loans. Risk associated with other loans is tied to the underlying collateral by each type of loan.\nCollateral is generally equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, 1-4 family residential construction and susceptible to the same risks mentioned with those\ncollateral types previously. Other risks consist of collateral that is secured by the stock of a non-depository financial institution, which can be unlisted stock\nwith a limited market for the stock, or volatility of asset values driven by market performance.\nBased on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed\nfinancial position.\n83\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nLeases Other\nRisk December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNon-watch list – Pass $ 1,716 $ 1,936 $ 285,497 $ 303,107\nWatch – Pass — — 14,655 737\nSpecial Mention — — — —\nSubstandard — — 96 24\nDoubtful — — — —\nTotal $ 1,716 $ 1,936 $ 300,248 $ 303,868\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from loans’ and HTM securities’ amortized cost bases to present the net amount expected to be collected\non the instrument. Loans and HTM securities are charged off against the ACL when management believes the balance has become uncollectible. Expected\nrecoveries are included in the allowance and do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses\nand is tracked over an economic cycle to capture a ‘through the cycle’ loss history. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current\nloan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in portfolio industry-based segmentation, risk rating and credit score changes, average prepayment rates,\nchanges in environmental conditions, or other relevant factors. For economic forecasts, the Company uses the Moody’s baseline scenario. The Company has\ndeveloped a dynamic reasonable and supportable forecast period that ranges from one to three years and changes based on economic conditions. Due to current\neconomic conditions, the Company’s reasonable and supportable forecast period is one year. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company\nreverts to historical losses. The reversion method applied to each portfolio can either be cliff or straight-line over four quarters.\nThe ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exists. The ACL also incorporates qualitative factors which represent\nadjustments to historical credit loss experience for items such as concentrations of credit and results of internal loan review. The Company has identified the\nfollowing portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods. The Company’s portfolio segmentation consists of\nCommercial and industrial, Specialty lending, Commercial real estate, Consumer real estate, Consumer, Credit cards, Leases and other, and Held-to-maturity\nsecurities. Multiple modeling techniques are used to measure credit losses based on the portfolio.\nThe ACL for Commercial and industrial and Leases and other segments are measured using a probability of default and loss given default method.\nPrimary risk drivers within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans along with changes of macro-economic variables. The economic variables\nutilized are typically comprised of leading and lagging indicators. The ACL for Commercial and industrial loans is calculated by modeling probability of\ndefault (PD) over future periods multiplied by historical loss given default rates (LGD) multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated\nprepayments and charge offs.\nCollateral positions for Specialty lending loans are continuously monitored by the Company and the borrower is required to continually adjust the\namount of collateral securing the loan. Credit losses are measured for any position where the amortized cost basis is greater than the fair value of the collateral.\nThe ACL for specialty lending loans is calculated by using a bottom-up approach comparing collateral values to outstanding balances.\nThe ACL for the Commercial real estate segment is measured using a PD and LGD method. Primary risk characteristics within the segment are risk\nratings of the individual loans, along with changes of macro-economic variables, such as interest rates, CRE price index, median household income,\nconstruction activity, farm income, and vacancy rates. The ACL for Commercial real estate loans is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on\npeer bank data. The PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge\noffs.\n84\nThe ACL for the Consumer real estate and Consumer segments are measured using an origination vintage loss rate method applied to the loans’\namortized cost balance. The primary risk driver within the segments is year of origination along with changes of macro-economic variables such as\nunemployment and the home price index.\nThe Credit card segment contains both consumer and commercial credit cards. The ACL for Consumer credit cards is measured using a PD and LGD\nmethod for Revolvers and average historical loss rates across a defined lookback period for Transactors. The PD and LGD method used for Revolvers is similar\nin nature to the method used in the Commercial and industrial and Commercial real estate segments. Primary risk drivers within the segment are credit ratings\nof the individual card holders along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and retail sales. The ACL for Commercial credit cards is\nmeasured using roll-rate loss rate method based on days past due.\nThe ACL for the State and political HTM securities segment is measured using a loss rate method based on historical bond rating transitions. Primary\nrisk drivers within the segment are bond ratings in the portfolio along with changes of macro-economic conditions. There is no ACL for the U.S. Agency and\nGSE mortgage-backed HTM securities portfolios as they are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or\nimplicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. For further discussion on these securities, including the aging and amortized cost balance of HTM securities, see\nNote 4, “Securities.”\nSee the credit quality indicators presented previously for a summary of current risk in the Company’s portfolio. Changes in economic forecasts will\naffect all portfolio segments, updated financial records from borrowers will affect portfolio segments by risk rating, updated credit scores will affect consumer\ncredit cards, payment performance will affect consumer and commercial credit card portfolio segments, and updated bond credit ratings will affect held-to-\nmaturity securities. The Company actively monitors all credit quality indicators for risk changes that will influence the current estimate.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes\nexpected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a\nconcessionary loan term has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or\nmodified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancelable by the Company.\nCredit card receivables do not have stated maturities. In determining the estimated life of a credit card receivable, management first estimates the future\ncash flows expected to be received and then applies those expected future cash flows to the credit card balance. Expected credit losses for credit cards are\ndetermined by estimating the amount and timing of principal payments expected to be received as payment for the balance outstanding as of the reporting period\nuntil the expected payments have been fully allocated. The ACL is recorded for the excess of the balance outstanding as of the reporting period over the\nexpected principal payments.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually include loans on nonaccrual, loans that\ninclude modifications deemed concessionary made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or any loans specifically identified, and are excluded from the\ncollective evaluation. When it is determined that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable, expected credit losses are based on the fair\nvalue of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for undiscounted selling costs as appropriate. All loans are classified as collateral dependent if placed on\nnon-accrual or include modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\n85\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RECORDED INVESTMENT IN LOANS\nThe following tables provide a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCommercial Specialty Commercial Consumer real Leases and\nand industrial lending real estate estate Consumer Credit cards other Total -

These modifications are analyzed to determine whether\nthe modification is considered concessionary, long term and made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications generally\ninclude interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the borrower short-term cash\nrelief to allow them to improve their financial condition. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the\nloan is considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the ACL as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not modify any loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nThe Company had no commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which the Company has modified an existing loan as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default. Determination\nof payment default\n88\ninvolves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term. For the year\nended December 31, 2023, the Company had no loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default\nwithin the 12 months following the modification date.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nThe prior period disclosures below are presented in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. A loan modification is considered a TDR when a\nconcession has been granted to a debtor experiencing financial difficulties. The Company’s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal\nreductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the debtor short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial\ncondition. The Company’s restructured loans are considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the allowance for credit loss as described above in the\nAllowance for Credit Losses section of this note.\nThe Company had no commitments to lend to borrowers with loan modifications classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2022. The Company monitors\nloan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default. Determination of payment default involves analyzing the\neconomic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two commercial TDRs with a pre-modification loan balance of $5.1 million and a post-\nmodification loan balance of $4.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had no TDRs for which there was a payment default within the\n12 months following the restructure date.\n4.

The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest\nrates caused by changing economic conditions. The Company has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt\nsecurities have not changed and are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates.\nFor the State and political subdivision portfolio, the majority of the Company’s holdings are in general obligation bonds, which have a very low\nhistorical default rate due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. For the State and political, Corporates, and Collateralized\nloan obligations portfolios, the Company has a robust process for monitoring credit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews\nand analysis. The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these segments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector\ntrends.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $4.9 million impairment on one Corporate available-for-sale security.\nAs of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there is no ACL related to the Company’s available-for-sale securities as the decline in fair value did not result\nfrom credit issues.\nSecurities Held to Maturity\nThe following table provides detailed information about securities held to maturity at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (in thousands):\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Allowance for Net Carrying\n2023 Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Credit Losses Amount\nU.S. Agency $ 123,210 $ — $ (2,686) $ 120,524 $ — $ 123,210\nMortgage-backed 2,738,253 18 (356,657) 2,381,614 — 2,738,253\nState and political subdivisions 2,830,405 21,021 (170,197) 2,681,229 (3,258) 2,827,147\nTotal $ 5,691,868 $ 21,039 $ (529,540) $ 5,183,367 $ (3,258) $ 5,688,610\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Allowance for Net Carrying\n2022 Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Credit Losses Amount\nU.S. Agency $ 123,091 $ — $ (4,567) $ 118,524 $ — $ 123,091\nMortgage-backed 2,965,586 11 (392,530) 2,573,067 — 2,965,586\nState and political subdivisions 2,772,922 17,618 (201,472) 2,589,068 (2,407) 2,770,515\nTotal $ 5,861,599 $ 17,629 $ (598,569) $ 5,280,659 $ (2,407) $ 5,859,192\n91\nThe following table presents contractual maturity information for securities held to maturity at December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAmortized Fair\nCost Value\nDue in 1 year or less $ 104,561 $ 103,899\nDue after 1 year through 5 years 327,449 319,378\nDue after 5 years through 10 years 850,990 817,129\nDue after 10 years 1,670,615 1,561,347\nTotal 2,953,615 2,801,753\nMortgage-backed securities 2,738,253 2,381,614\nTotal securities held to maturity $ 5,691,868 $ 5,183,367\nExpected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or\nprepayment penalties.\nThere were no sales of securities held to maturity during 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, securities with an amortized cost of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion were transferred from the\navailable-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. The\ntransfers of securities were made at fair value at the time of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the time of transfer is retained in AOCI and will be\namortized over the remaining life of the securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the transferred securities. No gains or losses\nwere recognized at the time of the transfers. The amortized cost balance of securities held to maturity in the tables above includes a net unamortized unrealized\nloss of $207.2 million and $247.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccrued interest on securities held to maturity totaled $27.2 million and $27.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included\nin the Accrued income line on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The U.S. Agency and GSE\nmortgage-backed securities are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. Therefore, the Company’s expected lifetime loss for these portfolios is zero and there is no ACL recorded for these portfolios. The\n92\nCompany has no knowledge of any underlying credit issues and the cash flows underlying the debt securities have not changed and are not expected to be\nimpacted by changes in interest rates.\nFor the State and political subdivision portfolio, the Company’s holdings are in general obligation bonds as well as private placement bonds, which have\nvery low historical default rates due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. The Company has a robust process for monitoring\ncredit risk, including both pre-purchase and ongoing post-purchase credit reviews and analysis. The Company monitors credit ratings of all bond issuers in these\nsegments and reviews available financial data, including market and sector trends. The underlying bonds are evaluated for credit losses in conjunction with\nmanagement’s estimate of the ACL based on credit rating.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost basis by credit rating of the Company’s held-to-maturity State and political subdivisions bond investments\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nAmortized Cost Basis by Credit Rating - HTM Debt Securities\n2023 AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC-C Total\nState and political\nsubdivisions:\nCompetitive $ — $ 7,704 $ 464,349 $ 641,743 $ 30,734 $ 15,326 $ 2,649 $ 1,162,505\nUtilities 757,381 795,448 87,736 26,720 615 — — 1,667,900\nTotal state and political\nsubdivisions $ 757,381 $ 803,152 $ 552,085 $ 668,463 $ 31,349 $ 15,326 $ 2,649 $ 2,830,405\nAmortized Cost Basis by Credit Rating - HTM Debt Securities\n2022 AAA AA A BBB BB CCC-C Total\nState and political\nsubdivisions:\nCompetitive $ — $ — $ 435,953 $ 618,517 $ 17,120 $ 2,934 $ 1,074,524\nUtilities 759,539 824,386 84,293 29,599 581 — 1,698,398\nTotal state and political\nsubdivisions $ 759,539 $ 824,386 $ 520,246 $ 648,116 $ 17,701 $ 2,934 $ 2,772,922\nCompetitive held-to-maturity securities include not-for-profit enterprises that provide public functions such as housing, higher education, or healthcare,\nbut do so in a competitive environment.

The limits on proprietary\ntrading are largely focused on purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal primarily for the purpose of short-term resale,\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or realizing short-term arbitrage profits. The limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and\nprivate-equity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in managed or advised funds and are not exposed to\nsignificant losses arising directly or indirectly from them. The Volcker Rule also provides for increased capital charges, quantitative limits, rigorous compliance\nprograms, and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities, including a prohibition on transactions with a covered fund that would\nconstitute a covered transaction under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The fund activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are in\nconformance with the Volcker Rule.\n99\nActual capital amounts as well as required and well-capitalized common equity tier 1, tier 1, total and tier 1 leverage ratios as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022 for the Company and the Bank are as follows (in thousands):\n2023\nTo Be Well Capitalized Under\nPrompt Corrective Action\nActual For Capital Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital:\nUMB Financial Corporation $ 3,418,676 10.94% $ 1,406,371 4.50% $ N/A N/A%\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,477,634 11.21 1,395,873 4.50 2,016,261 6.50\nTier 1 Capital:\nUMB Financial Corporation 3,418,676 10.94 1,875,161 6.00 N/A N/A\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,477,634 11.21 1,861,164 6.00 2,481,551 8.00\nTotal Capital:\nUMB Financial Corporation 4,014,910 12.85 2,500,215 8.00 N/A N/A\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,690,378 11.90 2,481,551 8.00 3,101,939 10.00\nTier 1 Leverage:\nUMB Financial Corporation 3,418,676 8.49 1,611,076 4.00 N/A N/A\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,477,634 8.52 1,633,347 4.00 2,041,684 5.00\n2022\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital:\nUMB Financial Corporation $ 3,129,030 10.62% $ 1,325,893 4.50% $ N/A N/A%\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,184,837 10.88 1,317,571 4.50 1,903,158 6.50\nTier 1 Capital:\nUMB Financial Corporation 3,129,030 10.62 1,767,857 6.00 N/A N/A\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,184,837 10.88 1,756,762 6.00 2,342,349 8.00\nTotal Capital:\nUMB Financial Corporation 3,682,619 12.50 2,357,142 8.00 N/A N/A\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,359,158 11.47 2,342,349 8.00 2,927,936 10.00\nTier 1 Leverage:\nUMB Financial Corporation 3,129,030 8.43 1,483,953 4.00 N/A N/A\nUMB Bank, n. a. 3,184,837 8.46 1,506,443 4.00 1,883,054 5.00\n11.

This plan is for the benefit of\nsubstantially all eligible officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company recognized expense related to such contributions of $2.0\nmillion, $2.0 million, and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company has a qualified 401(k) profit sharing plan that permits participants to make contributions by salary deduction, to which the Company\nmakes matching contributions.

The LTIP permits the issuance to selected officers of the Company service-based\nrestricted stock grants, performance-based restricted stock grants and non-qualified stock options. Service-based restricted stock grants contain a service\nrequirement. The performance-based restricted grants contain performance and service requirements. The non-qualified stock option grants contain a service\nrequirement.\nAt the April 23, 2013 shareholders’ meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved amendments to the LTIP Plan, including increasing the number\nof shares of the Company’s stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from 5.25 million shares to 7.44 million shares. Additionally, the shareholders approved\nincreasing the maximum benefits any one eligible employee may receive under the plan during any one fiscal year from $1 million to $2 million taking into\naccount the value of all stock options and restricted stock received.\nAt the April 24, 2018 shareholders’ meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive\nCompensation Plan which became effective as of April 24, 2018 and replaced the LTIP plan. No service-based restricted stock grants, performance-based\nrestricted stock grants or non-qualified stock options have been issued under the LTIP since 2018.\nThe service-based restricted stock grants issued under the LTIP contained a service requirement with varying vesting schedules. The majority of these\ngrants issued in 2016 through 2018 utilized a vesting schedule in which 50% of the shares vest after two years of service, 75% after three years of service and\n100% after four years of service. Certain other grants utilized vesting schedules in which the grants vest ratably over the requisite service period or contain a\nthree-year cliff vesting.\nThe dividends on service-based restricted stock grants are treated as two separate transactions. First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock.\nThose cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock. Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock have the same\nterms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, similar to all dividend transactions.\nTotal fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was $2.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\nThe non-qualified stock options carry a service requirement and grants issued prior to 2016 vested 50% after three years, 75% after four years and 100%\nafter five years, while grants issued in 2016 through 2018 vested 50% after two years, 75% after three years and 100% after four years.\nThe table below discloses the information relating to non-qualified option activity in 2023 under the LTIP:\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining\nNumber of Average Price Contractual Aggregate\nShares Per Share Term Intrinsic Value\nStock Options Under the LTIP\nOutstanding - December 31, 2022 137,858 $ 62.08\nGranted — —\nCanceled — —\nExpired (4,956) 69.85\nExercised (35,278) 55.12\nOutstanding - December 31, 2023 97,624 $ 64.20 2.5 $ 1,888,911\nExercisable - December 31, 2023 97,624 $ 64.20 2.5 $ 1,888,911\nThere were no options granted during 2023, 2022, or 2021. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, was $640 thousand, $1.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was no unrecognized compensation cost\nrelated to nonvested options.\n101\nCash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation plans was $1.9 million, $1.5 million, and $18.4 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The tax benefit realized for stock options exercised was $1.6 million, $2.2 million, and $2.6 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company has no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the Company has historically\nmade adequate discretionary repurchases of common shares in an amount that exceeds stock option exercise activity. See a description of the Company’s\nRepurchase Authorizations in Note 14, “Common Stock and Earnings Per Share,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provided in Item 8 of\nthis report.\nOmnibus Incentive Compensation Plan\nAt the April 24, 2018 shareholders’ meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive\nCompensation Plan (OICP) which became effective as of April 24, 2018. The OICP permits the issuance to key employees of the Company various types of\nawards, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards. Service-based restricted stock\nunit awards contain a service requirement and the performance-based restricted stock unit awards contain performance and service requirements. The number of\nshares of the Company’s stock reserved for issuance under the OICP is 5.40 million shares.\nThe service-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and the majority contain a service requirement with a four-year graded\nvesting schedule in which 50% of the units are vested after two years, 75% are vested after three years, and 100% are vested after four years. Grants of service-\nbased restricted stock units made beginning in 2023 contain a service requirement with a three-year pro-rata vesting schedule. Certain other grants utilize\nvesting schedules in which the grants vest ratably over the requisite service period or have a cliff vesting.\nThe performance-based restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of stock and contain a service and a performance requirement. The\nperformance requirement is based on two predetermined performance requirements over a three-year period. The service requirement portion is a three-year cliff\nvesting. If the minimum performance requirement is not met, the participants do not receive the shares.\nThe dividends on service-based restricted stock units are treated as two separate transactions. First, cash dividends are paid on the restricted stock units.\nThose cash dividends are then paid to purchase additional shares of restricted stock units. Dividends earned as additional shares of restricted stock units have\nthe same terms as the associated grant. The dividends paid on the stock are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, similar to all dividend transactions.\nDividends are not paid on performance-based restricted stock units.\nThe table below discloses the status of the service-based restricted stock units during 2023:\nWeighted Average\nNumber of Units Price Per Unit\nService-Based Restricted Stock Units Under the OICP\nNonvested - December 31, 2022 379,986 $ 82.64\nGranted 168,254 88.74\nCanceled (42,988) 89.57\nVested (140,142) 72.64\nNonvested - December 31, 2023 365,110 $ 88.47\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $13.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested service-based restricted stock units.

COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table summarizes the share transactions for the three years ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except for share data):\nShares Issued Shares in Treasury\nBalance January 1, 2021 55,056,730 (7,050,344)\nPurchase of Treasury Stock — (67,671)\nSale of Treasury Stock — 6,835\nIssued for stock options and restricted stock — 485,255\nBalance December 31, 2021 55,056,730 (6,625,925)\nPurchase of Treasury Stock — (341,785)\nSale of Treasury Stock — 6,487\nIssued for stock options and restricted stock — 223,897\nBalance December 31, 2022 55,056,730 (6,737,326)\nPurchase of Treasury Stock — (94,727)\nSale of Treasury Stock — 7,782\nIssued for stock options and restricted stock — 321,668\nBalance December 31, 2023 55,056,730 (6,502,603)\nThe Board authorized, at its April 26, 2022, and April 27, 2021 meetings, the repurchase of up to two million shares of the Company’s common stock\nduring the twelve months following each meeting. On July 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of\nthe Company's common stock, which will terminate on April 30, 2024. All share purchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations are intended to be within\nthe scope of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for purchases in a given day if the Company satisfies the\nmanner, timing and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own common shares. The Company has not made any repurchase of its securities other\nthan pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential common shares that were outstanding during the year.\nThe shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, are shown below:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average basic common shares outstanding 48,503,643 48,340,922 48,271,462\nDilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock 260,177 406,477 466,830\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding 48,763,820 48,747,399 48,738,292\n107\n15. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters\nof credit, standby letters of credit, and futures contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the\namount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract or notional amount of those instruments reflects the extent of involvement the Company\nhas in particular classes of financial instruments. Many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total amount of these commitments\ndoes not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit,\ncommercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit is represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same\ncredit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. These\nconditions generally include, but are not limited to, each customer being current as to repayment terms of existing loans and no deterioration in the customer’s\nfinancial condition. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The interest rate is\ngenerally a variable rate. If the commitment has a fixed interest rate, the rate is generally not set until such time as credit is extended. For credit card customers,\nthe Company has the right to change or terminate terms or conditions of the credit card account at any time. Since a large portion of the commitments and\nunused credit card lines are never actually drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company\nevaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on an individual basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of\ncredit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral pledged by customers varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, plant and\nequipment, stock, securities and certificates of deposit.\nCommercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce. Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule,\ndrafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as intended.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company payable upon the non-performance of a customer’s obligation to a third\nparty. The Company issues standby letters of credit for terms ranging from three months to six years. The Company generally requires the customer to pledge\ncollateral to support the letter of credit. The maximum liability to the Company under standby letters of credit at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $407.6\nmillion and $437.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, standby letters of credit totaling $29.7 million and $25.5 million, respectively,\nwere with related parties to the Company.\nThe credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities. The Company holds collateral\nsupporting those commitments when deemed necessary. Collateral varies but may include such items as those described for commitments to extend credit.\nFutures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified\nfuture date, of a specified instrument, at a specified yield. Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from\nmovement in securities values and interest rates. Instruments used in trading activities are carried at fair value and gains and losses on futures contracts are\nsettled in cash daily. Any changes in the fair value are recognized in trading and investment banking income.\nThe Company uses contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in the trading portfolio. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno notional amounts outstanding for these contracts. There were no open futures contract positions during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. There\nwas no net futures activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. The Company controls the credit risk of its futures contracts through credit\napprovals, limits and monitoring procedures.\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts on a limited basis. For operating purposes, the Company maintains certain balances in foreign\nbanks. Foreign exchange contracts are purchased on a monthly basis\n108\nto avoid foreign exchange risk on these foreign balances. The Company will also enter into foreign exchange contracts to facilitate foreign exchange needs of\ncustomers. The Company will enter into a contract to buy or sell a foreign currency at a future date only as part of a contract to sell or buy the foreign currency\nat the same future date to a customer. During 2023, contracts to purchase and to sell foreign currency averaged approximately $19.3 million compared to $13.8\nmillion during 2022. The net gains on these foreign exchange contracts for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $4.2 million, $3.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nWith respect to group concentrations of credit risk, most of the Company’s business activity is with customers in the states of Missouri, Kansas,\nColorado, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Illinois, and Texas. At December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any significant credit concentrations in any\nparticular industry.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments as described above (in thousands):\nContract or Notional Amount December 31,\n2023 2022\nCommitments to extend credit for loans (excluding credit card loans) $ 12,831,831 $ 12,988,231\nCommitments to extend credit under credit card loans 4,286,604 4,008,386\nCommercial letters of credit 1,224 3,334\nStandby letters of credit 407,574 436,965\nForward contracts 26,471 32,552\nSpot foreign exchange contracts 4,830 5,112\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to\nextend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur\nand an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate is based on expected utilization rates by\nportfolio segment. Utilization rates are influenced by historical trends and current conditions. The expected utilization rates are applied to the total commitment\nto determine the expected amount to be funded. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit\nloss rates to the expected amount to be funded.\nThe following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:\nRevolving Lines of Credit: includes commercial, construction, agricultural, personal, and home-equity. Risk inherent to revolving lines of credit often\nare related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. During\nthese financial troubles, the borrower could have less than desirable assets collateralizing the revolving line of credit. The financial strain the borrower is\nexperiencing could lead to drawing against the line without the ability to pay the line down.\nNon-Revolving Lines of Credit: include commercial and personal. Lines that do not carry a revolving feature are generally associated with a specific\nexpenditure or project, such as to purchase equipment or the construction of real estate. The predominate risk associated with non-revolving lines is the\ndiversion of funds for other expenditures. If the funds get diverted, the contributory value to collateral suffers.\nLetters of Credit: includes standby letters of credit. Generally, a standby letter of credit is established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the\napplicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and the applicant. These obligations might be the\nperformance of a service or delivery of a product. If the obligations are not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit.\nThe ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $5.1 million and $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was recorded in\nthe Accrued expenses and taxes line of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Provision of $2.0 million was recorded for off-balance sheet credit\nexposures for the year ended December 31, 2023. A $500 thousand of provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. A reduction of $3.0 million of provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures was\n109\nrecorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the Provision for credit losses line of the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n16. INCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes as set forth below produce effective income tax rates of 17.0% in 2023, 18.9% in 2022, and 17.7% in 2021. These percentages are\ncomputed by dividing Income tax expense by Income before income taxes.\nIncome tax expense includes the following components (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent tax\nFederal $ 81,565 $ 92,673 $ 72,410\nState 10,452 13,964 16,356\nTotal current tax expense 92,017 106,637 88,766\nDeferred tax\nFederal (19,438) (3,998) (9,872)\nState (1,001) (2,310) (2,852)\nTotal deferred tax benefit (20,439) (6,308) (12,724)\nTotal tax expense $ 71,578 $ 100,329 $ 76,042\nThe reconciliation between the income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal tax rate of 21% for income before income\ntaxes is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nStatutory federal income tax expense $ 88,536 $ 111,722 $ 90,103\nTax-exempt interest income (20,614) (20,206) (20,635)\nTax-exempt life insurance related income (4,961) (723) (2,631)\nMeals, entertainment and related expenses 1,582 854 580\nState and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefits 7,466 9,207 10,659\nEquity-based compensation (1,377) (1,921) (1,889)\nFederal tax credits, net of amortization of LIHTC investments (5,049) (3,748) (2,634)\nOther 5,995 5,144 2,489\nTotal tax expense $ 71,578 $ 100,329 $ 76,042\nIn preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to interpret tax laws and regulations to determine its taxable income. Periodically, the Company is\nsubject to examinations by various taxing authorities that may give rise to differing interpretations of these laws. Upon examination, agreement of tax liabilities\nbetween the Company and the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns may ultimately be different. The Company is in the examination\nprocess with two state tax authorities for tax years 2019 and 2020. The Company believes the aggregate amount of any additional liabilities that may result\nfrom these examinations, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and the tax basis of\nassets and liabilities for income tax return purposes.\n110\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet unrealized loss on securities available for sale $ 202,804 $ 248,001\nLoans, principally due to allowance for credit losses 47,995 43,129\nEquity-based compensation 7,446 7,743\nAccrued expenses 35,779 25,007\nDeferred compensation 17,918 15,375\nMiscellaneous 3,617 2,289\nTotal deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 315,559 341,544\nValuation allowance (3,286) (180)\nTotal deferred tax assets 312,273 341,364\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nNet unrealized gain on fair value hedges (17,855) (18,617)\nNet unrealized gain on cash flow hedges (4,133) (1,798)\nLand, buildings and equipment (27,772) (33,036)\nOriginal issue discount (496) (992)\nPrepaid expenses (6,672) (5,862)\nPartnership investments (6,059) (6,737)\nTrust preferred securities (6,673) (6,912)\nIntangibles (16,843) (17,225)\nMiscellaneous (3,574) (1,760)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (90,077) (92,939)\nNet deferred tax asset $ 222,196 $ 248,425\nAs of December 31, 2023, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.2 million are included in the miscellaneous deferred tax assets line\nitem above. These deferred tax assets include approximately $34.1 million related to net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income\nin future periods and reduce our income taxes payable in those future periods. Most of these net operating losses expire at various times between 2024 and 2043\nand some have an indefinite carryforward. During the year ended December 31, 2023, due to cumulative losses, the Company established a state valuation\nallowance of $2.1 million, against certain state deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of $1.2 million\nand $13 thousand, respectively, for certain state net operating losses as they are not expected to be realized. In addition, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany had a valuation allowance of $2.1 million and $167 thousand, respectively, to reduce certain other state deferred tax assets to the amount management\nbelieves will be more likely than not realized.\nThe net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in the Other assets line of the Company’s Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. With few exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 2018 in the jurisdictions in\nwhich it files.\nLiabilities Associated With Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $10.9 million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of\nunrecognized tax benefits, net of associated deferred tax benefit, that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, would be $8.6 million and $7.4 million\nat December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits relate to state tax positions that have a corresponding federal tax\nbenefit. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not expect this change to\nhave a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.\n111\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits - opening balance $ 9,360 $ 8,798\nGross increases - tax positions in prior period 64 —\nGross decreases - tax positions in prior period — (63)\nGross increases - current-period tax positions 2,807 2,621\nLapse of statute of limitations (1,310) (1,996)\nUnrecognized tax benefits - ending balance $ 10,921 $ 9,360\n17. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its\nexposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks,\nincluding interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities. Specifically, the Company\nenters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and\nuncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in\nthe amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the\nCompany’s loans and borrowings. The Company also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and,\ntherefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk of the Company’s assets or liabilities. The Company has entered into an offsetting position for each of these\nderivative instruments with a matching instrument from another financial institution in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nThe table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company’s derivative\nassets and derivative liabilities are located within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each\nderivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including\ninterest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its\nown nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative\ncontracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral\npostings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.\nThis table provides a summary of the fair value of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in\nthousands):\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nDecember 31, December 31,\nFair Value 2023 2022 2023 2022\nInterest Rate Products:\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 99,574 $ 47,638 $ 105,016 $ 126,231\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments 61,922 483 67 103\nTotal $ 161,496 $ 48,121 $ 105,083 $ 126,334\n112\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps\ndesignated as fair value hedges involve making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments over the\nlife of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps that were designated as fair\nvalue hedges as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had three interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of\ninterest rate risk associated with the Company’s municipal bond securities. These swaps had a notional amount of $254.6 million as of December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company terminated all three fair value hedges. In connection with these terminated hedges, $11.5 million of\nhedging adjustments will be amortized through the contractual maturity date of each respective hedged item.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the\nCompany primarily uses interest rate swaps and floors as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges\ninvolve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without\nexchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had two interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow\nhedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by Marquette Capital Trusts III and IV. These swaps had\nan aggregate notional amount of $51.5 million at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of\nvariable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company had three interest rate floors with an aggregate notional amount of $1.0 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.\nThe Company did not have any interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022.\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company terminated an interest rate floor with a notional amount of $750.0 million. At the date of termination, the interest rate\nfloor had a net asset fair value of $34.1 million. The gross unrealized gain on the terminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI was $2.7 million, or $2.0\nmillion net of tax, and $7.4 million, or $5.6 million net of tax, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The unrealized gain will be reclassified into\nInterest income as the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings through the original maturity of the hedged forecasted transactions. The total\nremaining term over which the unrealized gain will be reclassified into earnings is 0.7 years.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and is\nsubsequently reclassified into interest expense and interest income in the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts\nreported in AOCI related to interest rate swap derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company’s\nhedged items. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate floor derivatives will be reclassified to Interest income as interest payments are received or\npaid on the Company’s hedged items. The Company expects to reclassify $1.1 million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest expense and $2.5 million from\nAOCI to Interest income during the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for\nforecasted transactions over a maximum period of 12.7 years.\nNon-designated Hedges\nThe remainder of the Company’s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not\nspeculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking\ncustomers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company\nexecutes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.\nFair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to\naccess. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable\ninputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In such cases, the fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement in its entirety.\n115\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nDecember 31, for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable\nDescription 2023 Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nU.S. Treasury $ 881 $ 881 $ — $ —\nU.S. Agencies — — — —\nMortgage-backed 1,738 — 1,738 —\nState and political subdivisions 13,482 — 13,482 —\nCorporates 1,974 1,974 — —\nTrading – other 18 18 — —\nTrading securities 18,093 2,873 15,220 —\nU.S. Treasury 1,298,742 1,298,742 — —\nU.S. Agencies 159,721 — 159,721 —\nMortgage-backed 3,620,785 — 3,620,785 —\nState and political subdivisions 1,286,975 — 1,286,975 —\nCorporates 351,275 351,275 — —\nCollateralized loan obligations 351,115 — 351,115 —\nSecurities available for sale 7,068,613 1,650,017 5,418,596 —\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values 11,228 11,228 — —\nCompany-owned life insurance 69,727 — 69,727 —\nBank-owned life insurance 523,960 — 523,960 —\nDerivatives 161,496 — 161,496 —\nTotal $ 7,853,117 $ 1,664,118 $ 6,188,999 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives $ 105,083 $ — $ 105,083 $ —\nSecurities sold not yet purchased 8,018 — 8,018 —\nTotal $ 113,101 $ — $ 113,101 $ —\n116\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2022 Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nDecember 31, Identical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable\nDescription 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3)\nAssets\nU.S. Treasury $ 580 $ 580 $ — $ —\nU.S. Agencies 7,558 — 7,558 —\nMortgage-backed — — — —\nState and political subdivisions 8,038 — 8,038 —\nCorporates 1,024 1,024 — —\nTrading – other 780 780 — —\nTrading securities 17,980 2,384 15,596 —\nU.S. Treasury 777,070 777,070 — —\nU.S. Agencies 171,296 — 171,296 —\nMortgage-backed 3,982,122 — 3,982,122 —\nState and political subdivisions 1,362,407 — 1,362,407 —\nCorporates 367,500 367,500 — —\nCollateralized loan obligations 345,952 — 345,952 —\nSecurities available for sale 7,006,347 1,144,570 5,861,777 —\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values 10,782 10,782 — —\nCompany-owned life insurance 56,769 — 56,769 —\nBank-owned life insurance 510,293 — 510,293 —\nDerivatives 48,121 — 48,121 —\nTotal $ 7,650,292 $ 1,157,736 $ 6,492,556 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives $ 126,334 $ — $ 126,334 $ —\nSecurities sold not yet purchased 3,503 — 3,503 —\nTotal $ 129,837 $ — $ 129,837 $ —\nValuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring basis:\nTrading Securities Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities.\nSecurities Available for Sale Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair\nvalue is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market\ninputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the\nyear, if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold. Variances are\nanalyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or\nrevise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide\ndocumentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement\nwithin the fair value hierarchy is appropriate.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values Fair values are based on quoted market prices.\nCompany-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.\nBank-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.\n117\nDerivatives Fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each\nderivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including\ninterest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own\nnonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts\nfor the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings,\nthresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.\nSecurities sold not yet purchased Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available,\nfair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market\ninputs.\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices in Total Gains\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant Recognized During\nDecember 31, for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs the Twelve Months\nDescription 2023 Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Ended December 31\nCollateral dependent assets $ 2,796 $ — $ — $ 2,796 $ 141\nOther real estate owned 1,738 — — 1,738 66\nTotal $ 4,534 $ — $ — $ 4,534 $ 207\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2022 Using\nQuoted Prices in Total Losses\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant Recognized During\nDecember 31, for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs the Twelve Months\nDescription 2022 Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Ended December 31\nCollateral dependent assets $ 4,373 $ — $ — $ 4,373 $ (2,998)\nOther real estate owned 68 — — 68 —\nTotal $ 4,441 $ — $ — $ 4,441 $ (2,998)\nValuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis:\nCollateral Dependent Assets Collateral dependent assets are assets evaluated as part of the ACL on an individual basis. Those assets for which there is\nan associated allowance are considered financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments are recorded on certain assets to reflect\nwrite-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral. The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of\ncomparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the property being valued. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is\nplaced on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the\nCompany’s property management group and the Company’s credit department. The valuation of collateral dependent assets and impaired loans are reviewed on\na quarterly basis. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3.\nOther real estate owned Other real estate owned consists of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised\nof commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, recreational and marine vehicles. Other real estate owned is recorded\nas held for sale initially at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. The initial valuation of the foreclosed property\n118\nis obtained through an appraisal process similar to the process described in the collateral dependent/impaired loans paragraph above. Subsequent to foreclosure,\nvaluations are reviewed quarterly and updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements\nmay be based upon appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods and those measurements are classified as Level 3.\nFair value disclosures require disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial\nliabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis.\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Total\nCarrying Assets (Level Inputs (Level Inputs (Level Estimated Fair\nAmount 1) 2) 3) Value\nFINANCIAL ASSETS\nCash and short-term investments $ 5,852,347 $ 5,612,003 $ 240,344 $ — $ 5,852,347\nSecurities available for sale 7,068,613 1,650,017 5,418,596 — 7,068,613\nSecurities held to maturity (exclusive of allowance for credit\nlosses) 5,691,868 — 5,183,367 — 5,183,367\nTrading securities 18,093 2,873 15,220 — 18,093\nOther securities 492,935 11,228 481,707 — 492,935\nLoans (exclusive of allowance for credit losses) 23,176,904 — 22,969,788 — 22,969,788\nDerivatives 161,496 — 161,496 — 161,496\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nDemand and savings deposits 32,719,268 32,719,268 — — 32,719,268\nTime deposits 3,073,591 — 3,073,591 — 3,073,591\nOther borrowings 3,919,644 13,813 3,905,831 — 3,919,644\nLong-term debt 383,247 — 413,896 — 413,896\nDerivatives 105,083 — 105,083 — 105,083\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCommitments to extend credit for loans 11,523\nCommitments to extend resell agreements 208\nCommercial letters of credit 138\nStandby letters of credit 4,047\n119\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2022 Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Total\nCarrying Assets (Level Inputs (Level Inputs (Level Estimated Fair\nAmount 1) 2) 3) Value\nFINANCIAL ASSETS\nCash and short-term investments $ 2,638,384 $ 1,686,787 $ 951,597 $ — $ 2,638,384\nSecurities available for sale 7,006,347 1,144,570 5,861,777 — 7,006,347\nSecurities held to maturity (exclusive of allowance for credit\nlosses) 5,861,599 — 5,280,659 — 5,280,659\nTrading securities 17,980 2,384 15,596 — 17,980\nOther securities 349,758 10,782 338,976 — 349,758\nLoans (exclusive of allowance for credit losses) 21,033,167 — 20,816,899 — 20,816,899\nDerivatives 48,121 — 48,121 — 48,121\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nDemand and savings deposits 31,721,995 31,721,995 — — 31,721,995\nTime deposits 917,138 — 917,138 — 917,138\nOther borrowings 2,222,167 62,480 2,159,687 — 2,222,167\nLong-term debt 381,311 — 418,737 — 418,737\nDerivatives 126,334 — 126,334 — 126,334\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCommitments to extend credit for loans 9,260\nCommercial letters of credit 185\nStandby letters of credit 3,982\nCash and short-term investments The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates\nof their fair values.\nSecurities held to maturity For U.S. Agency and mortgage-backed securities, as well as general obligation bonds in the State and political subdivision\nportfolio, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using\nquoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis,\nthe Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional\nresearch is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant\nadjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes\nreference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. For\nprivate placement bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates.\nOther securities Amount consists of FRB and FHLB stock held by the Company, equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values, including equity-method investments and other miscellaneous investments. The carrying amount of the FRB\nand FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying amount. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost,\nwhich approximates fair value.\nLoans Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate,\nconsumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans is estimated by\ndiscounting the future cash flows. The discount rates used are estimated using comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be\ncommensurate with the credit risk, overhead costs, and optionality of such instruments.\nDemand and savings deposits The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts was the amount payable on demand at period-end.\n120\nTime deposits The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates that are currently\noffered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.\nOther borrowings The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of their\nfair value because of the short-term nature of their maturities. Federal funds purchased are classified as Level 1 based on availability of quoted market prices\nand repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are classified as Level 2.\nLong-term debt Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of\nexisting debt.\nOther off-balance sheet instruments The fair value of loan commitments and letters of credit are determined based on the fees currently charged to\nenter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. Neither the fees\nearned during the year on these instruments nor their fair value at period-end are significant to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\n19.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer have each evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “Disclosure Controls and Procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the\nExchange Act) and have concluded that the Company’s Disclosure Controls and Procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate “internal control over financial reporting,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and\nwith the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and effected by the Board,\nmanagement and other personnel, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the criteria established\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In addition, given the Company’s size, operations and footprint, lapses or deficiencies in internal\ncontrols may occur from time to time.\nBased on the evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), management (with the participation of the Company’s\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) under the oversight of the Board of Directors, has concluded that internal control over financial reporting\nwas effective at the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, Kansas City, Missouri, (U.S. PCAOB Auditor Firm ID: 185),\nthe independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included within this report, has issued an attestation report on the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at the end of the period covered by this report. KPMG LLP's attestation report is set forth below.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last\nquarter of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n123\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nUMB Financial Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited UMB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance\nsheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’\nequity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial\nstatements), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 22, 2024\n124\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn December 13, 2023, four foundations and trusts that are related interests of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Mariner Kemper adopted a\nsingle, pre-arranged stock sale plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) (Rule 10b5-1) under the Exchange Act for the sale of shares of the Company’s common\nstock (the 2024 Plan). The 2024 Plan was entered into during an open trading window in accordance with the Company’s requirements regarding transactions in\nthe Company’s securities and is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1. The 2024 Plan provides for the monthly sale of an initial\nnumber of shares of the Company’s common stock once the market price of the Company’s common stock meets or exceeds certain minimum threshold prices\nas specified in the 2024 Plan. Should the market price of the Company’s shares meet or exceed secondary and tertiary pricing thresholds as specified in the 2024\nPlan, up to double and triple the initial number of shares in the aggregate may be sold in that month, respectively. If no sales occur in a month, the initial\nnumber of shares may be carried forward for sale in the following month subject to the pricing thresholds. Sales under the 2024 Plan may occur beginning in\nMarch of 2024 (after conclusion of the applicable cooling off period following adoption of the 2024 Plan) and end no later than December 31, 2024. The\naggregate number of shares of common stock of the Company that will be available for sale under the 2024 Plan will vary depending on the market price\nachieved but will not exceed a maximum of 399,000 shares in aggregate.\nITEM 9C.

Policy Overview\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of UMB Financial Corporation (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best\ninterest of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability\nand reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. This Compensation Recovery Policy (this\n“Policy”) provides for the mandatory recoupment of “erroneously awarded” (defined below) Incentive-Based\nCompensation (defined below) to Executive Officers (defined below) in the event that the Company is required to prepare\nan “accounting restatement” due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement\nunder applicable securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material\nmisstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. This Policy also\nprovides for the discretionary recoupment of Incentive-Based Compensation from employees who engaged in misconduct\nthat led to a material error in a Financial Reporting Measure (defined below) leading to erroneously awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation.\n2. Scope\nThe Board of the Company adopts this Policy to address the mandatory recoupment of certain Incentive-Based\nCompensation (defined below) in the event of an accounting restatement. The Policy is designed to comply with Section\n10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 5608 of the NASDAQ\nlisting standards and is made in accordance with the provisions of the Compensation Committee’s charter. This Policy\nalso addresses the discretionary recoupment of Incentive-Based Compensation from employees who engage in any illegal,\ndishonest, fraudulent, or intentional misconduct that materially contributes to the Company erroneously awarding\nIncentive-Based Compensation. The Policy supersedes and replaces in its entirety any prior or existing policies adopted\nby the Company with respect to the clawback of incentive-based compensation payable to an individual covered by this\nPolicy. Any determinations made by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”)\nrelating to this Policy shall be binding on all individuals.\n3. Definitions\nThe term “Executive Officer” means any individual identified as an officer of the Company pursuant to Rule 16a-1 of the\nExchange Act during the relevant recovery period.\nThe term “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in\npart upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. For the\nPage 2 of 8\nExhibit 97.1\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nStatus: Approved\nRevision Date: 10/31/2023\nCompany, Incentive-Based Competition may include, but is not limited to:\n· Bonuses under any Company Short-Term Incentive Compensation Program (or any equivalent successor plan\nor program)\n· Performance Shares\n· Performance Units\n· Stock Options\n· Cash Incentive Awards under the UMB Financial Corporation Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan\nIncentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial\nReporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the\nIncentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nThe term “Financial Reporting Measures” refers to measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived in whole or\nin part from such measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements of the\nCompany or included in a filing made by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial\nReporting Measures include, but are not limited to:\n· Company stock price\n· Total shareholder return (TSR)\n· Revenue\n· Net income\n· Pre-provision net revenue\n· Return measures such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return on average tangible\ncommon equity (ROTCE)\n· Earnings measures such as earnings per share\n4. Policy Requirements\nMandatory Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, the Company will require reimbursement\nor forfeiture of any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation Received by any Executive Officer during the\nthree completed fiscal years\nPage 3 of 8\nExhibit 97.1\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nStatus: Approved\nRevision Date: 10/31/2023\nimmediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement.\nThe compensation that is subject to mandatory recoupment under this Policy is erroneously awarded Incentive-Based\nCompensation that is Received by an Executive Officer:\na. after such person began service as an Executive Officer;\nb. who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based\nCompensation (for the avoidance of doubt, this includes both current and former Executive Officers);\nc. while the Company has a class of securities listed on Nasdaq (or such other national securities exchange\non which the Company’s securities are then listed); and\nd. during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to\nprepare an accounting restatement.\nThe Company’s obligation to recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not dependent on if or\nwhen the restated financial statements are filed.\nDiscretionary Recoupment\nThe Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, require reimbursement or forfeiture of any or all Incentive-Based\nCompensation from any individual who is identified by the Compensation Committee to have engaged in any illegal,\ndishonest, fraudulent, or intentional misconduct that materially contributed to the Company erroneously awarding\nIncentive-Based Compensation during any portion of the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the\ndiscovery of the illegal, dishonest, fraudulent, or intentional misconduct irrespective of whether an accounting\nrestatement is required.\nDetermination of Recovery Period\nFor purposes of determining the relevant recovery period for any mandatory recoupment, the date that the Company is\nrequired to prepare an accounting restatement shall be the earlier to occur of:\na. The date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take\nsuch action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company\nis required to prepare an accounting restatement; or\nb. The date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare the accounting\nrestatement.\nPage 4 of 8\nExhibit 97.1\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nStatus: Approved\nRevision Date: 10/31/2023\nAmount Subject to Mandatory Recoupment\nThe amount to be recovered (“erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation”) will be the amount of\nIncentive-Based Compensation Received by the Executive Officer that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts\ncomputed without regard to any taxes paid, as determined by the Compensation Committee. If the erroneously\nawarded Incentive-Based Compensation is based on a measurement that is not subject to a mathematical recalculation\ndirectly from the information in the accounting restatement (i.e., stock price or total shareholder return), the amount\nmust be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received, and the Company must maintain\ndocumentation of the determination of the reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\nAmount Subject to Discretionary Recoupment\nThe Compensation Committee shall determine the amount of discretionary recoupment up to the full amount of any\nIncentive-Based Compensation received by an individual during a period where the individual was found to have\nengaged in any illegal, dishonest, fraudulent, or intentional misconduct that had a material impact on causing the\nCompany to erroneously award Incentive-Based Compensation.\nMethod of Recoupment; Reasonably Promptly\nThe Company shall in the case of mandatory recoupment, or may in the case of discretionary recoupment, recover\n“reasonably promptly” any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in accordance with this Policy in a\nmethod determined by the Compensation Committee which may include, without limitation:\na. Requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid;\nb. Seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other distribution\nof equity awards;\nc. Offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the individual(s);\nd. Cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\ne. Taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Compensation\nCommittee.\nThe Compensation Committee shall determine the repayment schedule for each amount of erroneously awarded\nIncentive-Based Compensation in a manner that complies with the\nPage 5 of 8\nExhibit 97.1\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nStatus: Approved\nRevision Date: 10/31/2023\n“reasonably promptly” requirement. Such determination shall be made consistent with any applicable legal guidance,\nby the SEC, Nasdaq, judicial opinion, or otherwise. The determination of what constitutes “reasonably promptly” may\nvary from case to case and will depend on the particular facts and circumstances applicable to the Company, the\naccounting restatement and the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, among other factors. The\nCompensation Committee is authorized to adopt additional rules to further describe what repayment schedules satisfy\nthis requirement.\nIn the case of mandatory recoupment, the Compensation Committee may determine that the recovery of erroneously\nawarded compensation would be impracticable if:\na. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based\nCompensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such\nerroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide\ndocumentation to Nasdaq.\nb. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly\navailable to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C.\n411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the\nCompany to prepare an accounting restatement, the Committee may direct the Company to postpone the recovery of\nany Incentive-Based Compensation: (a) if the Company undertakes any legal challenge to such direction to prepare an\naccounting restatement; and (b) for only such time as it takes for the process to complete such legal challenge is\nunderway.\nNo Indemnification\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other policy or governing document of the Company or any agreement\nbetween the Company and an Executive Officer or an employee, the Company shall not indemnify or reimburse any\nExecutive Officer or employee against the loss of any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation.\nAgreement to the Policy by Executive Officers\nThe Compensation Committee will take reasonable steps to inform Executive Officers and employees of this Policy.\nExecutive Officers should read this Policy carefully and ask questions of the Company’s General Counsel.\nPage 6 of 8\nExhibit 97.1\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nStatus: Approved\nRevision Date: 10/31/2023\n5. Roles and Responsibilities\nThe Compensation Committee shall administer and interpret this Policy, make any required determinations under this\nPolicy and amend this Policy as it deems appropriate at any time. The Compensation Committee shall also consider any\nguidelines, directives and authorizations provided to the Compensation Committee by the Board from time to time in the\ncourse of administering this Policy. Decisions of the Compensation Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final,\nconclusive, and binding on all individuals subject to this Policy, unless determined to be an abuse of discretion or\ndetermined to be unenforceable by the SEC or NASDAQ.\n6. Exceptions\nThere shall be no exceptions to this Policy.\n7.

2024 (UNAUDITED)\n1. Financial Statement Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of UMB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) after the\nelimination of all intercompany transactions. In the opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments relating to items that are of a normal recurring\nnature and necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations have been made. The results of operations and cash flows for the\ninterim periods presented may not be indicative of the results of the full year ending December 31, 2024. The financial statements should be read in conjunction\nwith “Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Form\n10-Q) and in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) on February 22, 2024 (the Form 10-K).\nThe Company is a financial holding company, which offers a wide range of banking and other financial services to its customers through its branches and\noffices. The Company’s national bank, UMB Bank, National Association (the Bank), has its principal office in Missouri and also has branches in Arizona,\nColorado, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Company also has offices in Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana, Utah, Minnesota,\nCalifornia, Wisconsin, Iowa, Delaware, and New York.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A summary of the significant accounting policies to assist the reader in understanding the financial\npresentation is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes Cash and due from banks and amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). Cash on hand, cash items in the\nprocess of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks are included in Cash and due from banks. Amounts due from the FRB are interest-bearing for\nall periods presented and are included in the Interest-bearing due from banks line on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThis table provides a summary of cash and cash equivalents as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nDue from the FRB $ 6,498,695 $ 3,472,524\nCash and due from banks 778,069 454,705\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 7,276,764 $ 3,927,229\nAlso included in the Interest-bearing due from banks, but not considered cash and cash equivalents, are interest-bearing accounts held at other financial\ninstitutions, which totaled $103.2 million and $82.0 million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n9\nPer Share Data\nBasic net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted\nquarter-to-date net income per share includes the dilutive effect of 303,425 and 236,920 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and nonvested\nrestricted stock units granted by the Company and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Diluted year-to-date net income per share includes\nthe dilutive effect of 265,667 and 245,043 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and nonvested restricted stock units granted by the Company and\noutstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCertain options and restricted stock units issued under employee benefits plans were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share\nbecause they were anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding stock options or restricted stock units\nexcluded from the computation of diluted income per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 there were 57,883 and 209,245,\nrespectively, outstanding stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have\nbeen anti-dilutive.\nDerivatives\nThe Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndepends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting\nand whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Currently, 13 of the Company’s derivatives are designated in\nqualifying hedging relationships. However, the remainder of the Company’s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships, as the derivatives\nare not used to manage risks within the Company’s assets or liabilities. All changes in fair value of the Company’s non-designated derivatives and fair value\nhedges are recognized directly in earnings. Changes in fair value of the Company’s cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (AOCI) and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.\n3. New Accounting Pronouncements\nTroubled Debt Restructurings In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses:\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” The ASU eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) by creditors and\nenhanced disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The\namendments also added requirements to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases,\ndisclosed by credit-quality indicator and class of financing receivable. The amendments in this update were adopted prospectively on January 1, 2023. The\nadoption of the amendments had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional and revised financial statement disclosures. See\nNote 4, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses” for related disclosures.\nEquity-Method Investments In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, \"Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.\" The ASU allows entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity\ninvestments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. Previously, this method was\nonly available for qualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. The Company adopted the amended guidance on January 1,\n2024, upon which the Company elected to continue the use of the practical expedient under ASC 323-740-35-4 to account for low-income housing tax credit and\nhistoric tax credit investments. Under the practical expedient, the cost of a tax equity investment is amortized in proportion to income tax credits only and is\nrecorded on a net basis within income tax expense. The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside\nfrom annual disclosures which will be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The ASU is\nintended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update require additional disclosures primarily\nrelated to the rate\n10\nreconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements aside from additional\ndisclosures.\n4. Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLoan Origination/Risk Management\nThe Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to minimize the level of risk within the loan portfolio.\nDiversification of the loan portfolio manages the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Authority levels are established for the extension of\ncredit to ensure consistency throughout the Company. It is necessary that policies, processes, and practices implemented to control the risks of individual credit\ntransactions and portfolio segments are sound and adhered to. The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the\nrisk assessment on a continual basis. Management regularly evaluates the results of the loan reviews. The loan review process complements and reinforces the\nrisk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company’s policies and procedures.\nCommercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its\nbusiness. Commercial loans are made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash\nflows of the borrower, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by\nthe assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee. In the case of loans\nsecured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect\namounts from its customers.\nSpecialty lending loans include Asset-based loans, which are offered primarily in the form of revolving lines of credit to commercial borrowers that do\nnot generally qualify for traditional bank financing. Asset-based loans are underwritten based primarily upon the value of the collateral pledged to secure the\nloan, rather than on the borrower’s general financial condition. The Company utilizes pre-loan due diligence techniques, monitoring disciplines, and loan\nmanagement practices common within the asset-based lending industry to underwrite loans to these borrowers.\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans.\nThese loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher\nloan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business\nconducted on the property securing the loan. The Company requires that an appraisal of the collateral be made at origination and on an as-needed basis, in\nconformity with current market conditions and regulatory requirements. The underwriting standards address both owner and non-owner-occupied real estate.\nAlso included in Commercial real estate are Construction loans that are underwritten using feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis\nor absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value\nassociated with the complete project. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the\nsuccess of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim\nloan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have\nhigher risks than other real estate loans due to their repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, economic\nconditions, completion of the construction project, and the availability of long-term financing.\nConsumer real estate loans, including residential real estate and home equity loans, are underwritten based on the borrower’s loan-to-value percentage,\ncollection remedies, and overall credit history.\nConsumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer loans and\nleases. The underwriting and review practices combined with the\n11\nrelatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Consumer loans and leases that are 90 days past due or more\nare considered non-performing.\nCredit cards include both commercial and consumer credit cards. Commercial credit cards are generally unsecured and are underwritten with criteria\nsimilar to commercial loans, including an analysis of the borrower’s cash flow, available business capital, and overall creditworthiness of the borrower.\nConsumer credit cards are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment ability. The Company monitors delinquencies on all of its consumer credit cards and\nperiodically reviews the distribution of credit scores relative to historical periods to monitor credit risk on its consumer credit card loans. During the first quarter\nof 2024, the Company purchased a co-branded credit card portfolio. The purchase included $109.4 million in credit card receivables.\nCredit risk is a potential loss resulting from nonpayment of either the primary or secondary exposure. Credit risk is mitigated with formal risk\nmanagement practices and a thorough initial credit-granting process including consistent underwriting standards and approval process. Control factors or\ntechniques to minimize credit risk include knowing the client, understanding total exposure, analyzing the client and debtor’s financial capacity, and monitoring\nthe client’s activities. Credit risk and portions of the portfolio risk are managed through concentration considerations, average risk ratings, and other aggregate\ncharacteristics.\nLoan Aging Analysis\nThe following tables provide a summary of loan classes and an aging of past due loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nGreater\n30-89 than\nDays Past 90 Days Past\nDue and Due and Nonaccrual Total\nAccruing Accruing Loans Past Due Current Total Loans\nLoans\nCommercial and industrial 10,663,34 10,671,67\n$ 1,646 $ — $ 6,682 $ 8,328 $ 4 $ 2\nSpecialty lending — — — — 473,267 473,267\nCommercial real estate 1,917 — 598 2,515 9,778,484 9,780,999\nConsumer real estate 921 76 11,575 12,572 3,098,507 3,111,079\nConsumer 136 8 29 173 166,258 166,431\nCredit cards 11,350 7,049 407 18,806 562,930 581,736\nLeases and other — — — — 205,607 205,607\nTotal loans 24,948,39 24,990,79\n$ 15,970 $ 7,133 $ 19,291 $ 42,394 $ 7 $ 1\nDecember 31, 2023\nGreater\n30-89 than\nDays Past 90 Days Past\nDue and Due and Nonaccrual Total\nAccruing Accruing Loans Past Due Current Total Loans\nLoans\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,851 $ — $ 7,033 $ 9,884 $ 9,920,045 $ 9,929,929\nSpecialty lending — — — — 498,786 498,786\nCommercial real estate 1,848 — 737 2,585 8,891,341 8,893,926\nConsumer real estate 1,137 — 5,058 6,195 2,954,437 2,960,632\nConsumer 104 55 28 187 163,104 163,291\nCredit cards 5,343 3,056 285 8,684 415,272 423,956\nLeases and other — — 71 71 301,893 301,964\nTotal loans 23,144,87 23,172,48\n$ 11,283 $ 3,111 $ 13,212 $ 27,606 $ 8 $ 4\n12\nThe Company sold consumer real estate loans with proceeds of $60.8 million and $49.7 million in the secondary market without recourse during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company has ceased the recognition of interest on loans with a carrying value of $19.3 million and $13.2 million at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.

The total amount of accrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost basis of\nloans presented above. Further, the Company has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including\ntrends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans, net charge-offs, non-performing loans, and general economic conditions.\n15\nThe Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate loans.\nChanges in credit risk are monitored on a continuous basis and changes in risk ratings are made when identified. The loan ratings are summarized into the\nfollowing categories: Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful. Any loan not classified in one of the categories described below is considered to be a\nPass loan. A description of the general characteristics of the loan rating categories is as follows:\n• Special Mention – This rating reflects a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these\npotential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the borrower’s credit position at some future\ndate. The rating is not adversely classified and does not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.\n• Substandard – This rating represents an asset inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or\nof the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of\nthe debt. Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are\nnot corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets\nclassified as substandard.\n• Doubtful – This rating represents an asset that has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified as substandard, with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly\nquestionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending\nfactors, which may work to the advantage of strengthening the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact\nstatus may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, liquidation procedures, capital injection, or perfecting\nliens.\nCommercial and industrial\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial and industrial loans is included below:\nEquipment, accounts receivable, and inventory General commercial and industrial loans are secured by working capital assets and non-real estate\nassets. The general purpose of these loans is for financing capital expenditures and current operations for commercial and industrial entities. These assets are\nshort-term in nature. In the case of accounts receivable and inventories, the repayment of debt is reliant upon converting assets into cash or through goods and\nservices being sold and collected. Collateral-based risk is due to aged short-term assets, which can be indicative of underlying issues with the borrower and lead\nto the value of the collateral being overstated.\nAgriculture Agricultural loans are secured by non-real estate agricultural assets. These include shorter-term assets such as equipment, crops, and\nlivestock. The risks associated with loans to finance crops or livestock include the borrower’s ability to successfully raise and market the commodity. Adverse\nweather conditions and other natural perils can dramatically affect farmers’ or ranchers’ production and ability to service debt. Volatile commodity prices\npresent another significant risk for agriculture borrowers. Market price volatility and production cost volatility can affect both revenues and expenses.\nOverdrafts Commercial overdrafts are typically short-term and unsecured. Some commercial borrowers tie their overdraft obligation to their line of\ncredit, so any draw on the line of credit will satisfy the overdraft.\nBased on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed\nfinancial position.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\n16\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nRevolving\nAmortized Loans\nCost - Converted\nRevolving to Term\nRisk by Collateral 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Loans Loans Total\nEquipment/Accounts\nReceivable/Inventory\nPass 1,395,68 4,781,17 10,119,49\n$1,611,855 $ 8 $ 995,069 $ 820,239 $ 316,176 $ 198,413 $ 9 $ 875 $ 4\nSpecial Mention 2,453 22,583 10,773 9,845 62 — 88,962 — 134,678\nSubstandard 46,628 2,848 56,034 12,098 976 4,936 119,717 210 243,447\nDoubtful 1,142 — — — — — — 1,286 2,428\nTotal Equipment/Accounts 1,662,07 1,061,87 4,989,85 10,500,0\nReceivable/Inventory $ 8 $1,421,119 $ 6 $ 842,182 $ 317,214 $ 203,349 $ 8 $ 2,371 $ 47\nAgriculture\nPass $ 4,575 $ 5,889 $ 3,605 $ 2,697 $ 462 $ 246 $ 132,801 $ 400 $ 150,675\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard 8,164 — — — — — 2,246 — 10,410\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Agriculture $ 12,739 $ 5,889 $ 3,605 $ 2,697 $ 462 $ 246 $ 135,047 $ 400 $ 161,085\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nRevolving\nAmortized Loans\nCost - Converted\nRevolving to Term\nRisk by Collateral 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans Loans Total\nEquipment/Accounts\nReceivable/Inventory\nPass 1,767,38 1,462,71 4,473,08 9,524,85\n$ 3 $ 4 $1,115,205 $ 411,441 $ 194,181 $ 94,606 $ 5 $ 6,243 $ 8\nSpecial Mention 3,000 17,857 5,186 214 — — 39,059 — 65,316\nSubstandard 15,708 6,038 3,341 621 8,646 2,524 103,728 93 140,699\nDoubtful 1,210 — — — — — — — 1,210\nTotal Equipment/Accounts 1,787,30 1,486,60 1,123,73 4,615,87 9,732,08\nReceivable/Inventory $ 1 $ 9 $ 2 $ 412,276 $ 202,827 $ 97,130 $ 2 $ 6,336 $ 3\nAgriculture\nPass $ 13,934 $ 5,122 $ 3,785 $ 839 $ 477 $ 239 $ 159,565 $ — $ 183,961\nSpecial Mention — 66 — — — — 1,236 — 1,302\nSubstandard — 652 — 81 — — 8,372 — 9,105\nDoubtful — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Agriculture $ 13,934 $ 5,840 $ 3,785 $ 920 $ 477 $ 239 $ 169,173 $ — $ 194,368\nSpecialty lending\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Specialty loans is included below:\nAsset-based lending General asset-based loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate. The purpose of these loans is\nfor financing current operations for commercial customers. The repayment of debt is reliant upon collection of the accounts receivable within 30 to 90 days or\nconverting assets into\n17\ncash or through goods and services being sold and collected. The Company tracks each individual borrower credit risk based on their loan to collateral position.\nAny borrower position where the underlying value of collateral is below the fair value of the loan is considered out-of-margin and inherently higher risk.\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance by risk rating for asset-based loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nAsset-based lending\nRisk September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIn-margin $ 473,267 $ 498,786\nOut-of-margin — —\nTotal $ 473,267 $ 498,786\nCommercial real estate\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Commercial real estate loans is included below:\nOwner-occupied Owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple\neconomic cycles. The loans rely on the owner-occupied operations to service debt which cover a broad spectrum of industries. Real estate debt can carry a\nsignificant amount of leverage for a borrower to maintain.\nNon-owner-occupied Non-owner-occupied loans are secured by commercial real estate. These loans are often longer tenured and susceptible to multiple\neconomic cycles. The key element of risk in this type of lending is the cyclical nature of real estate markets. Although national conditions affect the overall real\nestate industry, the effect of national conditions on local markets is equally important. Factors such as unemployment rates, consumer demand, household\nformation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas. In addition to geographic considerations,\nmarkets can be defined by property type. While all sectors are influenced by economic conditions, some sectors are more sensitive to certain economic factors\nthan others.\nFarmland Farmland loans are secured by real estate used for agricultural purposes such as crop and livestock production. Assets used as collateral are\nlong-term assets that carry the ability to have longer amortizations and maturities. Longer terms carry the risk of added susceptibility to market conditions. The\nlimited purpose of some Agriculture-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan\nrepayment problems emerge.\n5+ Multi-family 5+ multi-family loans are secured by a multi-family residential property. The primary risks associated with this type of collateral are\nlargely driven by economic conditions. The national and local market conditions can change with unemployment rates or competing supply of multi-family\nhousing. Tenants may not be able to afford their housing or have better options and this can result in increased vacancy. Rents may need to be lowered to fill\napartment units. Increased vacancy and lower rental rates not only drive the borrower’s ability to repay debt but also contribute to how the collateral is valued.\n1-4 Family construction 1-4 family construction loans are secured by 1-4 family residential real estate and are in the process of construction or\nimprovements being made. The predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a project on\ntime and within budget. Market conditions also play an important role in understanding the risk profile. Risk from adverse changes in market conditions from\nthe start of development to completion can result in deflated collateral values.\nGeneral construction General construction loans are secured by commercial real estate in process of construction or improvements being made and\ntheir repayment is dependent on the collateral’s completion. Construction lending presents unique risks not encountered in term financing of existing real estate.\nThe predominant risk inherent to this portfolio is the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a\n18\nproject on time and within budget. Commercial properties under construction are susceptible to market and economic conditions. Demand from prospective\ncustomers may erode after construction begins because of a general economic slowdown or an increase in the supply of competing properties.\nBased on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed\nfinancial position.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year -

The primary risk is the borrower’s inability to repay debt.\nRevolving notes are often associated with HELOCs that can be secured by real estate without a 1st lien priority. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility\nimpacting home values or economic downturns.\n20\nFirst lien: 1-4 family First lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a first lien on 1-4 family residential property. These term loans carry longer maturities\nand amortizations. The longer tenure exposes the borrower to multiple economic cycles, coupled with longer amortizations that result in smaller principal\nreduction early in the life of the loan. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values.\nJunior lien: 1-4 family Junior lien 1-4 family loans are secured by a junior lien on 1-4 family residential property. The Company’s primary risk is the\nborrower’s inability to repay debt and not being in a first lien position. Collateral is susceptible to market volatility impacting home values or economic\ndownturns.\nA borrower is considered non-performing if the Company has ceased the recognition of interest and the loan is placed on non-accrual. Charge-offs and\nborrower performance are tracked on a loan origination vintage basis. Certain vintages, based on their maturation cycle, could be at higher risk due to collateral-\nbased risk factors.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nRevolving\nAmortized Loans\nCost - Converted\nRevolving to Term\nRisk by Collateral 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Loans Loans Total\nHELOC\nPerforming $ 90 $ — $ 460 $ 202 $ 265 $ 3,769 $ 366,946 $ 671 $ 372,403\nNon-performing — — — — 19 1,099 — 600 1,718\nTotal HELOC $ 90 $ — $ 460 $ 202 $ 284 $ 4,868 $ 366,946 $ 1,271 $ 374,121\nFirst lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming 2,682,35\n$ 300,778 $ 374,444 $ 568,721 $ 646,282 $ 510,281 $ 281,847 $ — $ — $ 3\nNon-performing 331 1,947 4,883 1,476 149 982 — — 9,768\n2,692,12\nTotal First lien: 1-4 family $ 301,109 $ 376,391 $ 573,604 $ 647,758 $ 510,430 $ 282,829 $ — $ — $ 1\nJunior lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming $ 11,346 $ 10,821 $ 10,460 $ 6,025 $ 3,220 $ 2,802 $ 75 $ — $ 44,749\nNon-performing — 18 30 — — 40 — — 88\nTotal Junior lien: 1-4\nfamily $ 11,346 $ 10,839 $ 10,490 $ 6,025 $ 3,220 $ 2,842 $ 75 $ — $ 44,837\n21\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - Term Loans\nAmortized\nCost -\nRevolving\nAmortized Loans\nCost - Converted\nRevolving to Term\nRisk by Collateral 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans Loans Total\nHELOC\nPerforming $ 150 $ 579 $ — $ 466 $ 82 $ 3,737 $ 355,047 $ 1,308 $ 361,369\nNon-performing — 71 — 31 — 1,221 58 56 1,437\nTotal HELOC $ 150 $ 650 $ — $ 497 $ 82 $ 4,958 $ 355,105 $ 1,364 $ 362,806\nFirst lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming 2,555,48\n$ 418,766 $ 583,711 $ 681,921 $ 548,736 $ 158,037 $ 164,315 $ 2 $ — $ 8\nNon-performing 546 1,690 87 123 191 882 — — 3,519\n2,559,00\nTotal First lien: 1-4 family $ 419,312 $ 585,401 $ 682,008 $ 548,859 $ 158,228 $ 165,197 $ 2 $ — $ 7\nJunior lien: 1-4 family\nPerforming $ 12,094 $ 11,911 $ 6,861 $ 3,927 $ 2,117 $ 1,722 $ 85 $ — $ 38,717\nNon-performing 23 32 — — — 47 — — 102\nTotal Junior lien: 1-4\nfamily $ 12,117 $ 11,943 $ 6,861 $ 3,927 $ 2,117 $ 1,769 $ 85 $ — $ 38,819\nConsumer\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Consumer loans is included below:\nRevolving line Consumer Revolving lines of credit are secured by consumer assets other than real estate.

The primary risk associated with this collateral class is credit card debt\nwhich is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay. The highly competitive environment\nfor credit card lending provides consumers with ample opportunity to hold several credit cards from different issuers and to pay only minimum monthly\npayments on outstanding balances. In such an environment, borrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic\ndownturn or a personal catastrophic event.\nThe consumer credit card portfolio is segmented by borrower payment activity. Transactors are defined as accounts that pay off their balance by the end\nof each statement cycle. Revolvers are defined as an account that carries a balance from one statement cycle to the next. These accounts incur monthly finance\ncharges, and, sometimes, late fees. Revolvers are inherently higher risk and are tracked by credit score.\nCommercial Commercial credit card loans are revolving loans made to small and commercial businesses. The primary risk associated with this\ncollateral class is credit card debt which is generally unsecured; therefore, repayment depends primarily on a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay.\nBorrowers may become over-extended and unable to repay, particularly in times of an economic downturn or a catastrophic event.\nThe commercial credit card portfolio is segmented by current and past due payment status. A borrower is past due after 30 days. In general, commercial\ncredit card customers do not have incentive to hold a balance resulting in paying interest on credit card debt as commercial customers will typically have other\ndebt obligations with lower interest rates in which they can utilize for capital.\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance of consumer credit cards by risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 (in thousands):\nConsumer\nRisk September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTransactor accounts $ 90,627 $ 74,330\nRevolver accounts (by credit score):\nLess than 600 16,299 7,140\n600-619 8,588 3,572\n620-639 14,044 5,343\n640-659 20,142 9,536\n660-679 20,147 9,642\n680-699 23,960 11,220\n700-719 25,532 13,489\n720-739 22,461 12,896\n740-759 18,927 12,434\n760-779 18,570 12,955\n780-799 17,353 11,822\n800-819 10,984 7,808\n820-839 5,503 4,054\n840+ 1,026 854\nTotal $ 314,163 $ 197,095\n24\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance of commercial credit cards by risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 (in thousands):\nCommercial\nRisk September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCurrent $ 250,571 $ 207,520\nPast Due 17,002 19,341\nTotal $ 267,573 $ 226,861\nLeases and other\nA discussion of the credit quality indicators that impact each type of collateral securing Leases and other loans is included below:\nLeases Leases are either loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures or are loans related to all other direct financing and\nleveraged leases on property for leasing to lessees other than for household, family and other personal expenditure purposes. All leases are secured by the lease\nbetween the lessor and the lessee. These assignments grant the creditor a security interest in the rent stream from any lease, an important source of cash to pay\nthe note in case of the borrower’s default.\nOther Other loans are loans that are obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S., loans to non-depository financial institutions, loans for\npurchasing or carrying securities, or all other non-consumer loans. Risk associated with other loans is tied to the underlying collateral by each type of loan.\nCollateral is generally equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, 1-4 family residential construction and susceptible to the same risks mentioned with those\ncollateral types previously. Other risks consist of collateral that is secured by the stock of a non-depository financial institution, which can be unlisted stock\nwith a limited market for the stock, or volatility of asset values driven by market performance.\nBased on the factors noted above for each type of collateral, the Company assigns risk ratings to borrowers based on their most recently assessed\nfinancial position.\nThe following table provides a summary of the amortized cost balance by collateral type and risk rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nLeases Other\nRisk September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPass $ 1,510 $ 1,716 $ 204,072 $ 300,152\nSpecial Mention — — — —\nSubstandard — — 25 96\nDoubtful — — — —\nTotal $ 1,510 $ 1,716 $ 204,097 $ 300,248\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation account that is deducted from loans’ and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities’ amortized cost bases to\npresent the net amount expected to be collected on the instrument. Loans and HTM securities are charged off against the ACL when management believes the\nbalance has become uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the allowance and do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and\nexpected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses\nand is tracked over an economic cycle to capture a ‘through the cycle’ loss history. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current\nloan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in portfolio industry-based segmentation,\n25\nrisk rating and credit score changes, average prepayment rates, changes in environmental conditions, or other relevant factors. For economic forecasts, the\nCompany uses the Moody’s baseline scenario. The Company has developed a dynamic reasonable and supportable forecast period that ranges from one to three\nyears and changes based on economic conditions. Due to current economic conditions, the Company’s reasonable and supportable forecast period is one year.\nAfter the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical losses. The reversion method applied to each portfolio can either be cliff\nor straight-line over four quarters.\nThe ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exists. The ACL also incorporates qualitative factors which represent\nadjustments to historical credit loss experience for items such as concentrations of credit and results of internal loan review. The Company has identified the\nfollowing portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods. The Company’s portfolio segmentation consists of\nCommercial and industrial, Specialty lending, Commercial real estate, Consumer real estate, Consumer, Credit cards, Leases and other, and Held-to-maturity\nsecurities. Multiple modeling techniques are used to measure credit losses based on the portfolio.\nThe ACL for Commercial and industrial and Leases and other segments are measured using a probability of default and loss given default method.\nPrimary risk drivers within the segment are risk ratings of the individual loans along with changes of macro-economic variables. The economic variables\nutilized are typically comprised of leading and lagging indicators. The ACL for Commercial and industrial loans is calculated by modeling probability of default\n(PD) over future periods multiplied by historical loss given default rates (LGD) multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments\nand charge offs.\nCollateral positions for Specialty lending loans are continuously monitored by the Company and the borrower is required to continually adjust the\namount of collateral securing the loan. Credit losses are measured for any position where the amortized cost basis is greater than the fair value of the collateral.\nThe ACL for specialty lending loans is calculated by using a bottom-up approach comparing collateral values to outstanding balances.\nThe ACL for the Commercial real estate segment is measured using a PD and LGD method. Primary risk characteristics within the segment are risk\nratings of the individual loans, along with changes of macro-economic variables, such as interest rates, CRE price index, median household income, construction\nactivity, farm income, and vacancy rates. The ACL for Commercial real estate loans is calculated by modeling PD over future periods based on peer bank data.\nThe PD loss rate is then multiplied by historical LGD multiplied by contractual exposure at default minus any estimated prepayments and charge offs.\nThe ACL for the Consumer real estate and Consumer segments are measured using an origination vintage loss rate method applied to the loans’\namortized cost balance. The primary risk driver within the segments is year of origination along with changes of macro-economic variables such as\nunemployment and the home price index.\nThe Credit card segment contains both consumer and commercial credit cards. The ACL for Consumer credit cards is measured using a PD and LGD\nmethod for Revolvers and average historical loss rates across a defined lookback period for Transactors. The PD and LGD method used for Revolvers is similar\nin nature to the method used in the Commercial and industrial and Commercial real estate segments. Primary risk drivers within the segment are credit ratings\nof the individual card holders along with changes of macro-economic variables such as unemployment and retail sales. The ACL for Commercial credit cards is\nmeasured using roll-rate loss rate method based on days past due.\nThe ACL for the State and political HTM securities segment is measured using a loss rate method based on historical bond rating transitions. Primary\nrisk drivers within the segment are bond ratings in the portfolio along with changes of macro-economic conditions. There is no ACL for the U.S. Agency and\nGSE mortgage-backed HTM securities portfolios as they are considered to be agency-backed securities with no risk of loss as they are either explicitly or\nimplicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. For further discussion on these securities, including the aging and amortized cost balance of HTM securities, see\nNote 5, “Securities.”\nSee the credit quality indicators presented previously for a summary of current risk in the Company’s portfolio. Changes in economic forecasts will\naffect all portfolio segments, updated financial records from borrowers will affect portfolio segments by risk rating, updated credit scores will affect consumer\ncredit cards,\n26\npayment performance will affect consumer and commercial credit card portfolio segments, and updated bond credit ratings will affect held-to-maturity\nsecurities. The Company actively monitors all credit quality indicators for risk changes that will influence the current estimate.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes\nexpected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a\nconcessionary loan term has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or\nmodified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancelable by the Company.\nCredit card receivables do not have stated maturities. In determining the estimated life of a credit card receivable, management first estimates the future\ncash flows expected to be received and then applies those expected future cash flows to the credit card balance. Expected credit losses for credit cards are\ndetermined by estimating the amount and timing of principal payments expected to be received as payment for the balance outstanding as of the reporting period\nuntil the expected payments have been fully allocated. The ACL is recorded for the excess of the balance outstanding as of the reporting period over the\nexpected principal payments.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually include loans on nonaccrual, loans that\ninclude modifications deemed concessionary made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or any loans specifically identified, and are excluded from the\ncollective evaluation. When it is determined that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable, expected credit losses are based on the fair\nvalue of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for undiscounted selling costs as appropriate. All loans are classified as collateral dependent if placed on\nnon-accrual or include modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RECORDED INVESTMENT IN LOANS\nThis table provides a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nCommercia\nl and Specialty Commercia Consumer Credit Leases Total -\nindustrial lending l real estate real estate Consumer cards and other Loans HTM Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 150,526 $ — $ 68,862 $ 3,567 $ 632 $ 13,936 $ 1,644 $ 239,167 $ 2,956 $ 242,123\nCharge-offs (892) — — (132) (357) (7,852) (4) (9,237) — (9,237)\nRecoveries 219 1 — 22 40 498 3 783 — 783\nProvision 7,630 (1) 3,238 287 188 7,106 (254) 18,194 (194) 18,000\nEnding balance - ACL $ 157,483 $ — $ 72,100 $ 3,744 $ 503 $ 13,688 $ 1,389 $ 248,907 $ 2,762 $ 251,669\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit\nexposures:\nBeginning balance $ 2,205 $ — $ 1,681 $ 80 $ 13 $ — $ 115 $ 4,094 $ 44 $ 4,138\nProvision 231 — (235) 5 3 — 20 24 (24) —\nEnding balance - ACL on\noff-balance sheet $ 2,436 $ — $ 1,446 $ 85 $ 16 $ — $ 135 $ 4,118 $ 20 $ 4,138\n27\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nCommercia\nl and Specialty Commercia Consumer Credit Leases Total -\nindustrial lending l real estate real estate Consumer cards and other Loans HTM Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 163,810 $ — $ 42,192 $ 6,527 $ 417 $ 7,231 $ 1,984 $ 222,161 $ 2,828 $ 224,989\nCharge-offs (1,908) (762) — (11) (254) (2,511) — (5,446) — (5,446)\nRecoveries 445 — — 6 32 345 — 828 — 828\nProvision (4,129) 762 3,524 304 303 2,651 504 3,919 58 3,977\nEnding balance - ACL $ 158,218 $ — $ 45,716 $ 6,826 $ 498 $ 7,716 $ 2,488 $ 221,462 $ 2,886 $ 224,348\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit\nexposures:\nBeginning balance $ 3,079 $ 186 $ 430 $ 119 $ 12 $ — $ 177 $ 4,003 $ 85 $ 4,088\nProvision 1,013 — 30 (2) (3) — (17) 1,021 (21) 1,000\nEnding balance - ACL on\noff-balance sheet $ 4,092 $ 186 $ 460 $ 117 $ 9 $ — $ 160 $ 5,024 $ 64 $ 5,088\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nCommercia\nl and Specialty Commercia Consumer Credit Leases Total -\nindustrial lending l real estate real estate Consumer cards and other Loans HTM Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 155,658 $ — $ 45,507 $ 6,941 $ 1,089 $ 7,935 $ 2,608 $ 219,738 $ 3,258 $ 222,996\nCharge-offs (1,886) — (250) (308) (1,026) (15,098) (4) (18,572) — (18,572)\nRecoveries 1,837 3 — 632 138 1,632 3 4,245 — 4,245\nProvision 1,874 (3) 26,843 (3,521) 302 19,219 (1,218) 43,496 (496) 43,000\nEnding balance - ACL $ 157,483 $ — $ 72,100 $ 3,744 $ 503 $ 13,688 $ 1,389 $ 248,907 $ 2,762 $ 251,669\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit\nexposures:\nBeginning balance $ 4,092 $ 186 $ 460 $ 117 $ 9 $ — $ 160 $ 5,024 $ 64 $ 5,088\nProvision (1,656) (186) 986 (32) 7 — (25) (906) (44) (950)\nEnding balance - ACL on\noff-balance sheet $ 2,436 $ — $ 1,446 $ 85 $ 16 $ — $ 135 $ 4,118 $ 20 $ 4,138\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nCommercia\nl and Specialty Commercia Consumer Credit Leases Total -\nindustrial lending l real estate real estate Consumer cards and other Loans HTM Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 136,737 $ — $ 39,370 $ 6,148 $ 494 $ 6,866 $ 2,221 $ 191,836 $ 2,407 $ 194,243\nCharge-offs (4,727) (762) (21) (1,153) (934) (6,181) — (13,778) — (13,778)\nRecoveries 3,331 1 21 24 154 1,125 — 4,656 — 4,656\nProvision 22,877 761 6,346 1,807 784 5,906 267 38,748 479 39,227\nEnding balance - ACL $ 158,218 $ — $ 45,716 $ 6,826 $ 498 $ 7,716 $ 2,488 $ 221,462 $ 2,886 $ 224,348\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit\nexposures:\nBeginning balance $ 2,178 $ 186 $ 418 $ 124 $ 13 $ — $ 62 $ 2,981 $ 107 $ 3,088\nProvision 1,914 — 42 (7) (4) — 98 2,043 (43) 2,000\nEnding balance - ACL on\noff-balance sheet $ 4,092 $ 186 $ 460 $ 117 $ 9 $ — $ 160 $ 5,024 $ 64 $ 5,088\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the Accrued expenses and taxes line of the Company’s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.

These modifications are analyzed to determine whether\nthe modification is considered concessionary, long term and made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications generally\ninclude interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These modifications allow the borrower short-term cash\nrelief to allow them to improve their financial condition. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the\nloan is considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part of the ACL as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no new modifications. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad two modifications on residential real estate loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty with a total pre-modification loan balance of $291\nthousand and a total\n30\npost-modification loan balance of $293 thousand. For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had no new modifications.\nThe Company had no commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which the Company has modified an existing loan as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default.\nDetermination of payment default involves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows\nduring the loan term. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no loan modifications made to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within the 12 months following the modification date.\n5.

The changes in fair value in the agency-backed portfolios are solely driven by change in interest\nrates caused by changing economic conditions.

Revenue Recognition\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which the Company generates revenue that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers:\nTrust and securities processing – Trust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of\nsecurities services, trust investments and wealth management services, and mutual fund and alternative asset servicing. The performance obligations related to\nthis revenue include items such as performing full bond trustee service administration, investment advisory services, custody and record-keeping services, and\nfund administrative and accounting services. These fees are part of long-term contractual agreements and the performance obligations are satisfied upon\ncompletion of service and fees are generally a fixed flat monthly rate or based on a percentage of the account’s market value per the contract with the customer.\nThese fees are primarily recorded within the Company’s Institutional and Personal Banking segments.\nTrading and investment banking – Trading and investment banking income consists of income earned related to the Company’s trading securities\nportfolio, including futures hedging, dividends, bond underwriting, and other securities incomes. The vast majority of this revenue is recognized in accordance\nwith ASC 320, Debt and Equity Securities, and is out of the scope of ASC 606. A portion of trading and investment banking represents fees earned for\nmanagement fees, commissions, and underwriting of corporate bond issuances. The performance obligations related to these fees include reviewing the credit\nworthiness of the customer, ensuring appropriate regulatory approval and participating in due diligence. The fees are fixed per the bond prospectus and the\nperformance obligations are satisfied upon registration approval of the bonds by the applicable regulatory agencies. Revenue is recognized at the point in time\nupon completion of service and when approval is granted by the regulators.\nService charges on deposits – Service charges on deposit accounts represent monthly analysis fees recognized for the services related to customer deposit\naccounts, including account maintenance and depository transactions processing fees. Commercial Banking and Institutional Banking depository accounts\ncharge fees in accordance with the customer’s pricing schedule while Personal Banking account holders are generally charged a flat service fee per month.\nDeposit service charges for the healthcare accounts included in the Institutional Banking segment are priced according to either standard pricing schedules with\nindividual account holders or according to service agreements between the Company and employer groups or third-party administrators. The Company satisfies\nthe performance obligation related to providing depository accounts monthly as transactions are processed and deposit service charge revenue is recorded\nmonthly. These fees are recognized within all Business Segments.\nInsurance fees and commissions – Insurance fees and commissions includes all insurance-related fees earned, including commissions for individual life,\nvariable life, group life, health, group health, fixed annuity, and variable annuity insurance contracts. The performance obligations related to these revenues\nprimarily represent the placement of insurance policies with the insurance company partners. The fees are based on the contracts with insurance company\npartners and the performance obligations are satisfied when the terms of the policy have been agreed to and the insurance policy becomes effective.\nBrokerage fees – Brokerage fees represent income earned related to providing brokerage transaction services, including commissions on equity and\ncommodity trades, and fees for investment management, advisory and administration. The performance obligations related to transaction services are executing\nthe specified trade and are priced according to the customer’s fee schedule. Such income is recognized at a point in time as the trade occurs and the performance\nobligation is fulfilled. The performance obligations related to investment management, advisory and administration include allocating customer assets across a\nwide range of mutual funds and other investments, on-going account monitoring and re-balancing of the portfolio. These performance obligations are satisfied\nover time and the related revenue is calculated monthly based on the assets under management of each customer. All material performance obligations are\nsatisfied as of the end of each accounting period.\nBankcard fees – Bankcard fees primarily represent income earned from interchange revenue from MasterCard and Visa for the Company’s processing of\ndebit, credit, HSA, and flexible spending account transactions. Additionally, the Company earns income and incentives related to various referrals of customers\nto card programs.\n41\nThe performance obligation for interchange revenue is the processing of each transaction through the Company’s access to the banking system. This\nperformance obligation is completed for each individual transaction and income is recognized per transaction in accordance with interchange rates established\nby MasterCard and Visa. The performance obligations for various referral and incentive programs include either referring customers to certain card products or\nissuing exclusively branded cards for certain customer segments. The pricing of these incentive and referral programs are in accordance with the agreement\nwith the individual card partner. These performance obligations are completed as the referrals are made or over a period of time when the Company is\nexclusively issuing branded cards. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had $10.2 million and $9.6 million\nof expense, respectively, recorded within the Bankcard fees line on the Company’s Consolidated Income Statements related to rebates and rewards programs that\nare outside of the scope of ASC 606. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had $28.5 million and $30.3 million\nof expense, respectively, related to these rebates and rewards programs. All material performance obligations are satisfied as of the end of each accounting\nperiod.\nInvestment securities gains, net – In the regular course of business, the Company recognizes gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities.\nAdditionally, the Company recognizes gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values and equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values. These gains and losses are recognized in accordance with ASC 321, Equity Securities, and are outside of the scope of ASC 606.\nOther income – The Company recognizes other miscellaneous income through a variety of other revenue streams, the most material of which include\nletter of credit fees, certain loan origination fees, gains on the sale of assets, derivative income, and bank-owned and company-owned life insurance income.\nThese revenue streams are outside of the scope of ASC 606 and are recognized in accordance with the applicable U.S. GAAP. The remainder of Other income is\nprimarily earned through transactions with personal banking customers, including wire transfer service charges, stop payment charges, and fees for items like\nmoney orders and cashier’s checks. The performance obligations of these types of fees are satisfied as transactions are completed and revenue is recognized\nupon transaction execution according to established fee schedules with the customers.\nThe Company had no material contract assets, contract liabilities, or remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024. Total receivables\nfrom revenue recognized under the scope of ASC 606 were $88.1 million and $86.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThese receivables are included as part of the Other assets line on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of noninterest income according to revenue stream and Business Segment for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As stated in Note 8, “Business Segment Reporting,” for comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are\nbased on methodologies in effect at September 30, 2024 and previously reported results have been reclassified in this Form 10-Q to conform to the Company’s\ncurrent organizational structure.\n42\nDisaggregated revenue is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue\n(Expense) out\nCommercial Institutional Personal of Scope of\nNONINTEREST INCOME Banking Banking Banking ASC 606 Total\nTrust and securities processing $ — $ 59,843 $ 14,379 $ — $ 74,222\nTrading and investment banking — 211 — 6,907 7,118\nService charges on deposit accounts 10,543 8,119 1,401 26 20,089\nInsurance fees and commissions — — 282 — 282\nBrokerage fees 68 13,689 1,992 — 15,749\nBankcard fees 18,776 8,421 5,377 (10,180) 22,394\nInvestment securities gains, net — — — 2,623 2,623\nOther 1,169 674 740 13,683 16,266\nTotal Noninterest income $ 30,556 $ 90,957 $ 24,171 $ 13,059 $ 158,743\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\n(Expense) out\nCommercial Institutional Personal of Scope of\nNONINTEREST INCOME Banking Banking Banking ASC 606 Total\nTrust and securities processing $ — $ 52,939 $ 13,729 $ — $ 66,668\nTrading and investment banking — 118 — 3,653 3,771\nService charges on deposit accounts 9,845 9,917 1,292 26 21,080\nInsurance fees and commissions — — 272 — 272\nBrokerage fees 69 11,353 1,978 — 13,400\nBankcard fees 16,763 6,337 5,483 (9,287) 19,296\nInvestment securities gains, net — — — 271 271\nOther 223 839 653 6,844 8,559\nTotal Noninterest income $ 26,900 $ 81,503 $ 23,407 $ 1,507 $ 133,317\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue\n(Expense) out\nCommercial Institutional Personal of Scope of\nNONINTEREST INCOME Banking Banking Banking ASC 606 Total\nTrust and securities processing $ — $ 170,394 $ 43,316 $ — $ 213,710\nTrading and investment banking — 757 — 17,284 18,041\nService charges on deposit accounts 31,386 27,638 4,002 81 63,107\nInsurance fees and commissions — — 832 — 832\nBrokerage fees 201 37,091 5,637 — 42,929\nBankcard fees 54,099 25,077 15,978 (28,446) 66,708\nInvestment securities gains, net — — — 10,127 10,127\nOther 1,469 2,261 2,074 41,648 47,452\nTotal Noninterest income $ 87,155 $ 263,218 $ 71,839 $ 40,694 $ 462,906\n43\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\n(Expense) out\nCommercial Institutional Personal of Scope of\nNONINTEREST INCOME Banking Banking Banking ASC 606 Total\nTrust and securities processing $ — $ 150,531 $ 40,085 $ — $ 190,616\nTrading and investment banking — 431 — 13,448 13,879\nService charges on deposit accounts 28,150 30,815 4,587 68 63,620\nInsurance fees and commissions — — 771 — 771\nBrokerage fees 197 34,835 5,648 — 40,680\nBankcard fees 49,263 19,677 16,775 (29,668) 56,047\nInvestment securities losses, net — — — (4,153) (4,153)\nOther 613 1,817 1,971 35,738 40,139\nTotal Noninterest income $ 78,223 $ 238,106 $ 69,837 $ 15,433 $ 401,599\n10. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters\nof credit, standby letters of credit, forward foreign exchange contracts and spot foreign exchange contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees,\nelements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contractual or notional amount of those\ninstruments reflects the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. Many of the commitments expire without being\ndrawn upon; therefore, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Company.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit,\ncommercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit is represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same\ncredit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments (in thousands):\nContractual or Notional Amount\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCommitments to extend credit for loans (excluding credit card loans) $ 12,875,899 $ 12,831,831\nCommitments to extend credit under credit card loans 5,439,782 4,286,604\nCommercial letters of credit 647 1,224\nStandby letters of credit 416,842 407,574\nForward contracts 78,086 26,471\nSpot foreign exchange contracts 36,241 4,830\nCommitments to extend credit for securities purchased under agreements to resell 60,000 —\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to\nextend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur\nand an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate is based on expected utilization rates by\nportfolio segment. Utilization rates are influenced by historical trends and current conditions.\n44\nThe expected utilization rates are applied to the total commitment to determine the expected amount to be funded. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit\nexposure is calculated by applying portfolio segment expected credit loss rates to the expected amount to be funded.\nThe following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:\nRevolving Lines of Credit: includes commercial, construction, agriculture, personal, and home-equity. Risks inherent to revolving lines of credit often\nare related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. During\nthese financial troubles, the borrower could have less than desirable assets collateralizing the revolving line of credit. The financial strain the borrower is\nexperiencing could lead to drawing against the line without the ability to pay the line down.\nNon-Revolving Lines of Credit: includes commercial and personal. Lines that do not carry a revolving feature are generally associated with a specific\nexpenditure or project, such as to purchase equipment or the construction of real estate. The predominate risk associated with non-revolving lines is the\ndiversion of funds for other expenditures. If funds get diverted, the contributory value to collateral suffers.\nLetters of Credit: includes standby letters of credit. Generally, a standby letter of credit is established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the\napplicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and applicant. These obligations might be the\nperformance of a service or delivery of a product. If the obligations are not met, it gives the beneficiary, the right to draw on the letter of credit.\nThe ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $4.1 million and $5.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was\nrecorded in the Accrued expenses and taxes line of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. There was no provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures\nrecorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a reduction of $1.0 million of provision was recorded\nfor off-balance sheet credit exposures. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, provision of $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, was\nrecorded for off-balance sheet credit exposures. Provision for off-balance sheet credit exposure is recorded in the Provision for credit losses line of the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n11. Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its\nexposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks,\nincluding interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities. Specifically, the Company\nenters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and\nuncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in\nthe amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the\nCompany’s loans and borrowings. The Company also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and,\ntherefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk of the Company’s assets or liabilities. The Company has entered into an offsetting position for each of these\nderivative instruments with a matching instrument from another financial institution in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nThe table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The\nCompany’s derivative assets and derivative liabilities are located within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\n45\nDerivative fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each\nderivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including\ninterest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own\nnonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts\nfor the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings,\nthresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.\nThis table provides a summary of the fair value of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in\nthousands):\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nSeptember 30, December 31, September 30, December 31,\nFair Value 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest Rate Products:\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 88,602 $ 99,574 $ 92,969 $ 105,016\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments 169,912 61,922 109 67\nTotal $ 258,514 $ 161,496 $ 93,078 $ 105,083\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps\ndesignated as fair value hedges involve making fixed rate payments to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable rate payments over the\nlife of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not\nhave any interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Company terminated 10 fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company's municipal bond securities. For\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company reclassified $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, from AOCI to Interest income in\nconnection with these terminated hedges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company reclassified $4.9 million and $3.5 million,\nrespectively, from AOCI to Interest income in connection with these terminated hedges. The unrealized gain on the terminated fair value hedges remaining in\nAOCI was $51.2 million net of tax, and $55.0 million net of tax, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The hedging adjustments will\nbe amortized through the contractual maturity date of each respective hedged item.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the\nCompany primarily uses interest rate swaps, floors, and floor spreads as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash\nflow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the\nagreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had two interest rate swaps\nthat were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by Marquette Capital\nTrusts III and IV. These swaps had an aggregate notional amount of $51.5 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nInterest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the strike\nrate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. Interest\n46\nrate floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates fall below the purchased floor\nrate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium, and involve payment of variable-rate amounts to the counterparty if interest rates fall below the sold\nfloor rate on the contract. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 11 interest rate floors and floor spreads with an aggregate notional amount of $2.5\nbillion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had three interest rate floors and floor spreads\nwith an aggregate notional amount of $1.0 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.\nIn 2020, the Company terminated an interest rate floor designated as a cash flow hedge. As of December 31, 2023, the gross unrealized gain on the\nterminated interest rate floor remaining in AOCI was $2.0 million net of tax. As of September 30, 2024 there was no gross unrealized gain on the terminated\ninterest rate floor remaining in AOCI. The unrealized gain was reclassified into Interest income as the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings\nthrough the original maturity of the hedged forecasted transactions.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and is\nsubsequently reclassified into interest expense and interest income in the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts\nreported in AOCI related to interest rate swap derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are received or paid on the Company’s\nhedged items. Amounts reported in AOCI related to interest rate floor and floor spread derivatives will be reclassified to Interest income as interest payments\nare received or paid on the Company’s items. The Company expects to reclassify $0.7 million from AOCI as a reduction to Interest expense and $6.6 million\nfrom AOCI to Interest income during the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows\nfor forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 12.0 years.\nNon-designated Hedges\nThe remainder of the Company’s derivatives are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not\nspeculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking\ncustomers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company\nexecutes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with\nthis program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized\ndirectly in earnings.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had not\nposted any collateral as there were no derivatives in a net liability position. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024, it could\nhave been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.\n12. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024,\nand December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.\nFair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to\naccess. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable\ninputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In such cases, the fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement in its entirety.\n49\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at September 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets (Level Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nDescription September 30, 2024 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nU.S. Treasury $ 1,611 $ 1,611 $ — $ —\nMortgage-backed 10,221 — 10,221 —\nState and political subdivisions 14,443 — 14,443 —\nCorporates 9,160 9,160 — —\nTrading – other 404 404 — —\nTrading securities 35,839 11,175 24,664 —\nU.S. Treasury 882,540 882,540 — —\nU.S. Agencies 161,821 — 161,821 —\nMortgage-backed 4,037,941 — 4,037,941 —\nState and political subdivisions 1,259,246 — 1,259,246 —\nCorporates 322,402 322,402 — —\nCollateralized loan obligations 352,048 — 352,048 —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 7,015,998 1,204,942 5,811,056 —\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair\nvalues 11,783 11,783 —\nCompany-owned life insurance 77,853 — 77,853 —\nBank-owned life insurance 536,131 — 536,131 —\nDerivatives 258,514 — 258,514 —\nTotal $ 7,936,118 $ 1,227,900 $ 6,708,218 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives $ 93,078 $ — $ 93,078 $ —\nSecurities sold not yet purchased 11,293 — 11,293 —\nTotal $ 104,371 $ — $ 104,371 $ —\n50\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets (Level Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nDescription December 31, 2023 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nU.S. Treasury $ 881 $ 881 $ — $ —\nMortgage-backed 1,738 — 1,738 —\nState and political subdivisions 13,482 — 13,482 —\nCorporates 1,974 1,974 — —\nTrading – other 18 18 — —\nTrading securities 18,093 2,873 15,220 —\nU.S. Treasury 1,298,742 1,298,742 — —\nU.S. Agencies 159,721 — 159,721 —\nMortgage-backed 3,620,785 — 3,620,785 —\nState and political subdivisions 1,286,975 — 1,286,975 —\nCorporates 351,275 351,275 — —\nCollateralized loan obligations 351,115 — 351,115 —\nAvailable for sale securities 7,068,613 1,650,017 5,418,596 —\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair\nvalues 11,228 11,228 — —\nCompany-owned life insurance 69,727 — 69,727 —\nBank-owned life insurance 523,960 — 523,960 —\nDerivatives 161,496 — 161,496 —\nTotal $ 7,853,117 $ 1,664,118 $ 6,188,999 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives $ 105,083 $ — $ 105,083 $ —\nSecurities sold not yet purchased 8,018 — 8,018 —\nTotal $ 113,101 $ — $ 113,101 $ —\nValuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a recurring basis:\nTrading Securities Fair values for trading securities (including financial futures), are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair\nvalue is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market\ninputs. On an annual basis, the Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Additionally, throughout the\nyear, if securities are sold, comparisons are made between the pricing services prices and the market prices at which the securities were sold. Variances are\nanalyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or\nrevise their quoted price. No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide\ndocumentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement\nwithin the fair value hierarchy is appropriate.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values Fair values are based on quoted market prices.\nCompany-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.\n51\nBank-owned Life Insurance Fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies.\nDerivatives Fair values are determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows from each\nderivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including\ninterest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own\nnonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts\nfor the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings,\nthresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.\nSecurities sold not yet purchased Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available,\nfair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market\ninputs.\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at September 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted Prices Total (Losses)\nin Active Significant Gains\nMarkets for Other Significant Recognized\nIdentical Observable Unobservable During the Nine\nSeptember 30, Assets (Level Inputs (Level Inputs (Level Months Ended\nDescription 2024 1) 2) 3) September 30\nCollateral dependent assets $ 2,399 $ — $ — $ 2,399 $ (906)\nOther real estate owned 227 — — 227 12\nTotal $ 2,626 $ — $ — $ 2,626 $ (894)\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices Total Gains\nin Active Significant Recognized\nMarkets for Other Significant During the\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Twelve Months\nDecember 31, Assets (Level Inputs (Level Inputs (Level Ended\nDescription 2023 1) 2) 3) December 31\nCollateral dependent assets $ 2,796 $ — $ — $ 2,796 $ 141\nOther real estate owned 1,738 — — 1,738 66\nTotal $ 4,534 $ — $ — $ 4,534 $ 207\nValuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis:\nCollateral Dependent Assets Collateral dependent assets are assets evaluated as part of the ACL on an individual basis. Those assets for which there is\nan associated allowance are considered financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments are recorded on certain assets to reflect\nwrite-downs that are based on the external appraised value of the underlying collateral. The external appraisals are generally based on recent sales of\ncomparable properties which are then adjusted for the unique characteristics of the property being valued. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is\nplaced on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists within the\nCompany’s property management group and the Company’s credit department. The valuations of the collateral dependent assets are\n52\nreviewed on a quarterly basis. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3.\nOther real estate owned Other real estate owned consists of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised\nof commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, recreational and marine vehicles. Other real estate owned is recorded\nas held for sale initially at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. The initial valuation of the foreclosed property is obtained through an\nappraisal process similar to the process described in the collateral dependent assets paragraph above. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are reviewed\nquarterly and updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements may be based upon\nappraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods and those measurements are classified as Level 3.\nFair value disclosures require disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial\nliabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis.\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at September 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Total\nCarrying Assets (Level Inputs (Level Inputs Estimated\nAmount 1) 2) (Level 3) Fair Value\nFINANCIAL ASSETS\nCash and short-term investments $ 7,779,169 $ 7,379,935 $ 399,234 $ — $ 7,779,169\nSecurities available for sale 7,015,998 1,204,942 5,811,056 — 7,015,998\nSecurities held to maturity (exclusive of allowance for credit\nlosses) 5,477,472 — 4,913,972 — 4,913,972\nTrading securities 35,839 11,175 24,664 — 35,839\nOther securities 465,477 11,783 453,694 — 465,477\nLoans (exclusive of allowance for credit losses) 24,995,967 — 25,164,755 — 25,164,755\nDerivatives 258,514 — 258,514 — 258,514\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nDemand and savings deposits 37,639,809 37,639,809 — — 37,639,809\nTime deposits 2,062,783 — 2,070,381 — 2,070,381\nOther borrowings 3,073,297 12,765 3,060,532 — 3,073,297\nLong-term debt 384,758 — 419,863 — 419,863\nDerivatives 93,078 — 93,078 — 93,078\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCommitments to extend credit for loans 8,672\nCommitments to extend resell agreements 292\nCommercial letters of credit 102\nStandby letters of credit 3,241\n53\nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Total\nCarrying Assets (Level Inputs (Level Inputs Estimated\nAmount 1) 2) (Level 3) Fair Value\nFINANCIAL ASSETS\nCash and short-term investments $ 5,852,347 $ 5,612,003 $ 240,344 $ — $ 5,852,347\nSecurities available for sale 7,068,613 1,650,017 5,418,596 — 7,068,613\nSecurities held to maturity (exclusive of allowance for credit\nlosses) 5,691,868 — 5,183,367 — 5,183,367\nTrading securities 18,093 2,873 15,220 — 18,093\nOther securities 492,935 11,228 481,707 — 492,935\nLoans (exclusive of allowance for credit losses) 23,176,904 — 22,969,788 — 22,969,788\nDerivatives 161,496 — 161,496 — 161,496\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nDemand and savings deposits 32,719,268 32,719,268 — — 32,719,268\nTime deposits 3,073,591 — 3,073,591 — 3,073,591\nOther borrowings 3,919,644 13,813 3,905,831 — 3,919,644\nLong-term debt 383,247 — 413,896 — 413,896\nDerivatives 105,083 — 105,083 — 105,083\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCommitments to extend credit for loans 11,523\nCommitments to extend resell agreements 208\nCommercial letters of credit 138\nStandby letters of credit 4,047\nCash and short-term investments The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates\nof their fair values.\nSecurities held to maturity For U.S. Agency and mortgage-backed securities, as well as general obligation bonds in the State and political subdivision\nportfolio, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using\nquoted market prices for similar securities. Prices are provided by third-party pricing services and are based on observable market inputs. On an annual basis,\nthe Company compares a sample of these prices to other independent sources for the same securities. Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional\nresearch is conducted with the third-party pricing services. Based on this research, the pricing services may affirm or revise their quoted price. No significant\nadjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing services. The pricing services also provide documentation on an ongoing basis that includes\nreference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate. For\nprivate placement bonds in the State and political subdivision portfolio, fair values are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates.\nOther securities Amount consists of FRB and FHLB stock held by the Company, equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values, including equity-method investments and other miscellaneous investments. The carrying amount of the FRB\nand FHLB stock equals its fair value because the shares can only be redeemed by the FRB and FHLB at their carrying amount. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost,\nwhich approximates fair value.\nLoans Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate,\nconsumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans are estimated by\ndiscounting the future cash flows. The\n54\ndiscount rates used are estimated using comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be commensurate with the credit risk, overhead\ncosts, and optionality of such instruments.\nDemand and savings deposits The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nTime deposits The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates that are currently\noffered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.\nOther borrowings The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of their\nfair value because of the short-term nature of their maturities. Federal funds purchased are classified as Level 1 based on availability of quoted market prices and\nrepurchase agreements and other short-term debt are classified as Level 2.\nLong-term debt Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing\ndebt.\nOther off-balance sheet instruments The fair value of loan commitments and letters of credit are determined based on the fees currently charged to\nenter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. Neither the fees\nearned during the year on these instruments nor their fair value at period-end are significant to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\n55\nITEM 2.

Management believes these objectives will guide its efforts to achieve its vision,\nto deliver the Unparalleled Customer Experience, all while seeking to improve net income and strengthen the balance sheet while undertaking prudent risk\nmanagement.\nThe first financial objective is to continuously improve operating efficiencies. The Company has focused on identifying efficiencies that simplify our\norganizational and reporting structures, streamline back-office functions, and take advantage of synergies and newer technologies among various platforms and\ndistribution networks. The Company has identified and expects to continue identifying ongoing efficiencies through the normal course of business that, when\ncombined with increased revenue, will contribute to improved operating leverage. During the third quarter of 2024, total revenue increased $50.5 million, or\n14.2%, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, while noninterest expense increased $21.0 million, or 9.1%, for the same period. As part of the initiative to\nimprove operating efficiencies, the Company continues to invest in technological advances that it believes will help management drive operating leverage in the\nfuture through improved data analysis and automation. The Company also continues to evaluate core systems and will invest in enhancements that it believes\nwill yield operating efficiencies.\nThe second financial objective is to increase net interest income through profitable loan and deposit growth and the optimization of the balance sheet.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company had an increase in net interest income of $25.1 million, or 11.3%, from the same period in 2023. The change in\nnet interest income was driven by increased average loan growth and higher rates, partially offset by higher interest expense due to an unfavorable mix shift in\nthe composition of liabilities. These changes are driven by the higher interest rate environment compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest\nincome was driven by a $1.6 billion, or 7.2%, increase in average loans, driven by organic loan growth, coupled with the impact of higher short-term and long-\nterm interest rates. The funding for these assets was driven primarily by a $4.5 billion, or 21.0%, increase in average interest-bearing deposits, offset by a\ndecrease in average borrowed funds of $1.1 billion, or 43.8%, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased\nthree basis points compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased loan yields and earning asset mix, partially offset by the cost and mix of\ninterest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread increased by three basis points during the same period. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the\neconomic markets resulting from governmental responses to inflation and reversionary signs in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on\nthe balance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year.\nThe third financial objective is to grow the Company’s revenue from noninterest sources. The Company seeks to grow noninterest revenues throughout\nall economic and interest rate cycles, while positioning itself to benefit in periods of economic growth. Noninterest income increased $25.4 million, or 19.1%,\nto $158.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. See greater detail below under Noninterest Income. The\nCompany continues to emphasize its asset management, brokerage, bankcard services, healthcare services, and treasury management businesses. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income represented 39.1% of total revenue, compared to 37.5% for the same period in 2023. The recent\neconomic changes have impacted fee income, especially those with assets tied to market values and interest rates.\nThe fourth financial objective is effective capital management. The Company places a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position,\nwhich management believes promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company’s ability to\ncapitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. The Company continues to maximize shareholder value through a mix of reinvesting in organic\ngrowth, evaluating acquisition opportunities that complement the Company’s strategies, increasing\n58\ndividends over time, and appropriately utilizing a share repurchase program. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.5 billion in total shareholders’ equity.\nThis is an increase of $728.8 million, or 26.0%, compared to total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a total\nrisk-based capital ratio of 13.14%. The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during the third quarter of 2024, except for shares acquired\npursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs.\nOn April 28, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with HTLF, a Delaware corporation, and Blue\nSky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement and the merger were unanimously\napproved by the boards of directors of the Company and HTLF. Pending regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of the Company and HTLF, the\nmerger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, HTLF stockholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.55\nshares of the Company’s common stock for each share of HTLF stock, with a total market value of approximately $2.0 billion.\nAdditionally, on April 29, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it entered into a forward\nsale agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. or its affiliate to issue 2,800,000 shares of its common stock for approximate proceeds of $201.6 million. The\nunderwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable within 30 days of April 28,\n2024. The underwriters exercised this option in full on April 30, 2024, upon which the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement relating to\nthe 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The forward purchase agreement is classified as an equity instrument under ASC 815-40, Contracts in\nEntity’s Own Equity.\nThe rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios, and the bank runs that\nled to the failures of some financial institutions in March of 2023, among other events, have resulted in significant volatility in the U.S. banking sector and\nheightened focus on liquidity, uninsured deposits, deposit composition, unrecognized investment losses, and capital.\nDuring November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the\nlosses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of certain financial institutions in March\nof 2023. The assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to\nexclude the first $5 billion, and will be collected at an annual rate of 13.4 basis points for eight quarterly assessment periods. The Company’s portion of this\nspecial assessment was $52.8 million and was recognized in noninterest expense during the fourth quarter of 2023. During 2024, the FDIC increased the\nestimated loss attributable to the 2023 bank failures, which in turn increased the special assessment the FDIC will charge to insured depository institutions. The\nFDIC also announced that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at an\nestimated quarterly rate of 1.9 basis points. The projected number of additional quarters and the estimated rate applicable to those quarters is subject to change\nbased on future adjustments to estimated losses or amendments to the assessment base. The Company recorded $7.5 million of expense related to the updated\nspecial assessment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and its impacts are discussed below.\nEarnings Summary\nThe following is a summary regarding the Company’s earnings for the third quarter of 2024. The changes identified in the summary are explained in\ngreater detail below. The Company recorded net income of $109.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of\n$96.6 million for the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.25 per share ($2.23 per share fully-diluted)\ncompared to $1.99 per share ($1.98 per share fully-diluted) for the third quarter of 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders’\nequity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 1.01% and 12.63%, respectively, compared to 0.97% and 13.25%, respectively, for the three-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company recorded net income of $321.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $279.1 million\nfor the same period a year earlier. Basic earnings per share for the\n59\nnine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were $6.59 per share ($6.56 per share fully-diluted) compared to $5.76 per share ($5.73 per share fully-diluted)\nfor the same period in 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common shareholders’ equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024\nwere 1.01% and 13.13%, respectively, compared to 0.95% and 13.18%, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.\nNet interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased $25.1 million, or 11.3%, and increased $42.3 million, or\n6.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, average earning assets increased by $3.7\nbillion, or 9.8%, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, they increased by $3.0 billion, or 8.1%, compared to the same periods in 2023. Net\ninterest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 2.46% and decreased to 2.49% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to 2.43% and 2.54% for the same periods in 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses increased by $13.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and increased by $0.8 million for the\nnine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes were driven by loan growth, portfolio credit metric\nchanges, and changes in macro-economic metrics in the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Company’s nonperforming loans increased $2.2\nmillion to $19.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. The ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans increased three basis points\nto 1.00% as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. For a description of the Company’s methodology for computing the ACL, please see the\nsummary discussion in the “Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses” section included below.\nNoninterest income increased by $25.4 million, or 19.1%, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and increased by $61.3 million, or\n15.3%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under\nNoninterest Income.\nNoninterest expense increased by $21.0 million, or 9.1%, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and increased by $47.2 million, or 6.6%,\nfor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail below under\nNoninterest Expense.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is a significant source of the Company’s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the\ninterest expense paid on liabilities. The volume of interest-earning assets and the related funding sources, the overall mix of these assets and liabilities, and the\nrates paid on each affect net interest income. Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased $25.1 million, or\n11.3%, and increased $42.3 million, or 6.1%, compared to the same periods in 2023.\nTable 1 shows the impact of earning asset rate changes compared to changes in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As illustrated in this table, net\ninterest spread for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased three basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 increased three basis points compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest spread for the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased by 12 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024 decreased by five basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The changes for three-month period ended September 30, 2024 are primarily due to\nincreased average loan balances and rates, partially offset by higher interest costs due to unfavorable mix shift in the composition of liabilities. The changes for\nthe nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were related to the cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increased loan volumes,\nrepricing of earning assets, and the benefit of interest free funds. The impact of the increased cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities had a significant impact\nin the third quarter of 2024. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 36 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 while the yield on earning assets\nincreased 39 basis points compared to the same period. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 66 basis points for the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 while the yield on earning assets increased 54 basis points compared to the same period. Earning\nasset balance increases have been primarily driven by higher average loans and increased interest-bearing due from banks balances. The Company expects to\nsee continued volatility in the economic markets and governmental responses to changes in the economy. These changing conditions could have impacts on the\n60\nbalance sheet and income statement of the Company for the remainder of the year. For the impact of the contribution from free funds, see the Analysis of Net\nInterest Margin within Table 2 below. Table 2 also illustrates how the changes in volume and interest rates have resulted in an increase in net interest income.\nTable 1\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS/YIELDS AND RATES (tax-equivalent basis) (unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the average earning assets and resulting yields, as well as the average interest-bearing liabilities\nand resulting yields, expressed in both dollars and rates. All average balances are daily average balances. The average yield on earning assets without the tax-\nequivalent basis adjustment would have been 5.41% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 5.01% for the same period in 2023. The average\nyield on earning assets without the tax-equivalent basis adjustment would have been 5.35% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 4.80% for\nthe same period in 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nBalance Yield/Rate Balance Yield/Rate\nASSETS\nLoans, net of unearned interest $ 24,387,163 6.79% $ 22,751,467 6.41%\nSecurities:\nTaxable 9,122,386 2.77 8,964,467 2.37\nTax-exempt 3,601,976 3.43 3,783,890 3.37\nTotal securities 12,724,362 2.96 12,748,357 2.66\nFederal funds and resell agreements 328,240 6.05 303,864 5.96\nInterest-bearing due from banks 3,562,746 5.36 1,548,867 5.26\nOther earning assets 19,743 6.37 17,327 5.31\nTotal earning assets 41,022,254 5.47 37,369,882 5.08\nAllowance for credit losses (239,950) (227,878)\nOther assets 2,484,538 2,381,496\nTotal assets $ 43,266,842 $ 39,523,500\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 25,789,850 4.05% $ 21,315,761 3.57%\nFederal funds and repurchase agreements 2,298,240 4.69 2,027,382 4.52\nBorrowed funds 1,464,393 5.61 2,605,897 5.28\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 29,552,483 4.18 25,949,040 3.82\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits 9,502,106 10,014,686\nOther liabilities 757,379 667,920\nShareholders' equity 3,454,874 2,891,854\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 43,266,842 $ 39,523,500\nNet interest spread 1.29% 1.26%\nNet interest margin 2.46 2.43\n61\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nBalance Yield/Rate Balance Yield/Rate\nASSETS\nLoans, net of unearned interest $ 23,850,976 6.73% $ 22,076,977 6.17%\nSecurities:\nTaxable 9,140,270 2.72 9,179,230 2.35\nTax-exempt 3,657,837 3.44 3,816,122 3.36\nTotal securities 12,798,107 2.93 12,995,352 2.64\nFederal funds and resell agreements 260,520 6.01 343,297 5.49\nInterest-bearing due from banks 3,451,537 5.41 1,935,029 4.90\nOther earning assets 21,333 6.88 13,071 5.56\nTotal earning assets 40,382,473 5.41 37,363,726 4.87\nAllowance for credit losses (230,181) (213,744)\nOther assets 2,433,597 2,322,171\nTotal assets $ 42,585,889 $ 39,472,153\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 24,500,489 3.96% $ 20,638,982 3.18%\nFederal funds and repurchase agreements 2,367,985 4.67 2,273,826 4.18\nBorrowed funds 1,796,230 5.53 2,319,652 5.25\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 28,664,704 4.12 25,232,460 3.46\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits 9,889,099 10,816,120\nOther liabilities 764,733 591,919\nShareholders' equity 3,267,353 2,831,654\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 42,585,889 $ 39,472,153\nNet interest spread 1.29% 1.41%\nNet interest margin 2.49 2.54\nTable 2 presents the dollar amount of change in net interest income and margin due to volume and rate.

The benefit from\ninterest-free funds was flat and increased seven basis points in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, primarily due to increased short-term interest rates.\n62\nTable 2\nANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN (unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 September 30, 2024 and 2023\nVolume Rate Total Volume Rate Total\nChange in interest earned on:\nLoans $ 26,670 $ 22,245 $ 48,915 $ 85,908 $ 97,489 $ 183,397\nSecurities:\nTaxable 940 9,071 10,011 (683) 25,751 25,068\nTax-exempt (1,656) 530 (1,126) (3,858) 2,286 (1,572)\nFederal funds sold and resell agreements 359 64 423 (3,626) 1,245 (2,381)\nInterest-bearing due from banks 27,054 364 27,418 60,814 8,094 68,908\nTrading 32 45 77 378 140 518\nInterest income 53,399 32,319 85,718 138,933 135,005 273,938\nChange in interest incurred on:\nInterest-bearing deposits 43,139 27,541 70,680 101,814 134,817 236,631\nFederal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 3,116 878 3,994 3,055 8,635 11,690\nOther borrowed funds (16,063) 2,018 (14,045) (21,376) 4,669 (16,707)\nInterest expense 30,192 30,437 60,629 83,493 148,121 231,614\nNet interest income $ 23,207 $ 1,882 $ 25,089 $ 55,440 $ (13,116) $ 42,324\nANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST MARGIN\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nAverage earning assets $41,022,254 $37,369,882 $ 3,652,372 $40,382,473 $37,363,726 $ 3,018,747\nInterest-bearing liabilities 29,552,483 25,949,040 3,603,443 28,664,704 25,232,460 3,432,244\nInterest-free funds $11,469,771 $11,420,842 $ 48,929 $11,717,769 $12,131,266 $ (413,497)\nFree funds ratio (interest-free funds to average earning\nassets) 27.96% 30.56% (2.60)% 29.02% 32.47% (3.45)%\nTax-equivalent yield on earning assets 5.47 5.08 0.39 5.41 4.87 0.54\nCost of interest-bearing liabilities 4.18 3.82 0.36 4.12 3.46 0.66\nNet interest spread 1.29 1.26 0.03 1.29 1.41 (0.12)\nBenefit of interest-free funds 1.17 1.17 — 1.20 1.13 0.07\nNet interest margin 2.46% 2.43% 0.03% 2.49% 2.54% (0.05)%\nProvision and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL represents management’s judgment of the total expected losses included in the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The\nCompany’s process for recording the ACL is based on the evaluation of the Company’s lifetime historical loss experience, management’s understanding of the\ncredit quality inherent in the loan portfolio, and the impact of the current economic environment, coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.\nA mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of management’s recorded ACL. To develop\nthe estimate, the Company follows the guidelines in ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost\nand any related credit\n63\ndeterioration in the Company’s available-for-sale debt security portfolio. Assets held at amortized cost include the Company’s loan book and held-to-maturity\nsecurity portfolio.\nThe process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans. These factors have been\nestablished over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics. This process is designed to produce\na lifetime estimate of the losses, at a reporting date, that includes evaluation of historical loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts, and the qualitative framework outlined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the published 2020 Interagency Policy\nStatement. This process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded ACL reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is\nconsidered.\nThe Company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework, extensive\nmethodology documentation, credit underwriting standards which encompass the Company’s desired risk profile, model validation, and ratio analysis. If the\nCompany’s total ACL estimate, as determined in accordance with the approved ACL methodology, is either outside a reasonable range based on review of\neconomic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis, the ACL estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reason(s).\nBased on that investigation, issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process, which may warrant\nadjustments to estimated credit losses.\nThe ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated ACL that represents management’s best estimate of the total expected losses included in the\nloan portfolio, held-to-maturity securities, and credit deterioration in available-for-sale securities.\nBased on the factors above, management of the Company recorded $18.0 million as provision for credit losses for the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, management of the\nCompany recorded $42.1 million as provision for credit losses, as compared to $41.2 million for the same period in 2023. These changes are the result of\napplying the methodology for computing the ACL, coupled with the impacts of the current and forecasted economic environment.

Table 4 above summarizes the components of\nnoninterest income and the respective year-over-year comparison for each category.\nTrust and securities processing income consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts, custody of securities services, trust investments\nand wealth management services, mutual fund assets, and alternative asset servicing. The increase in these fees for the three and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in fund services and corporate trust revenues. For the three-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2024, fund services revenue increased $5.2 million, or 13.6%, corporate trust revenue increased $1.8 million, or 12.4%, and trust\nincome increased $0.6 million, or 4.2%, compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, fund services revenue\nincreased $15.8 million, or 14.7%, corporate trust revenue increased $4.3 million, or 10.2%, and trust services revenue increased $3.1 million, or 7.4%,\ncompared to the same period in 2023. The recent volatile markets have impacted the income in this category. Since trust and securities processing fees are\nprimarily asset-based, which are highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected\nby changes in the securities markets. Management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving\nthe distribution channels.\nTrading and investment banking fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased $3.3 million, or 88.8%, and increased $4.2 million,\nor 30.0%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. These changes were primarily driven by the volatile\nmarket’s impact on trading volume. The income in this category is market driven and impacted by general increases or decreases in trading volume.\n66\nService charges on deposit accounts for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased $1.0 million, or 4.7%, and decreased $0.5 million,\nor 0.8%, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease for the three-month and nine-month period were driven by decreased healthcare\nincome.\nBrokerage fees for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.3 million, or 17.5%, and increased $2.2 million, or 5.5%, for the nine-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The changes in the three-month and nine-month periods were driven by 12b-1\nfees and money market income.\nBankcard fees for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased $3.1 million, or 16.1%, and increased $10.7 million, or 19.0%,\nrespectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was driven by increased interchange income for the three-month period and increased\ninterchange coupled with lower rebate costs in the nine-month period.\nInvestment securities gains, net for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.4 million, or 867.9%, and increased $14.3\nmillion, or 343.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was primarily\ndriven by net gains on dispositions of, and increased valuations in the Company's securities without readily determinable fair values during the third quarter of\n2024. The increase for the nine-month period was driven by a net gain of $12.0 million on dispositions of securities without readily determinable fair values\nduring 2024, coupled with a $4.9 million impairment loss on one Corporate available-for-sale security during the same period in 2023. The income in this\ncategory is highly correlated to the change in market value of the assets, and the related income for the remainder of the year will be affected by changes in the\nsecurities markets. The Company’s investment portfolio is continually evaluated for opportunities to improve its performance and risk profile relative to market\nconditions and the Company’s interest rate expectations. This can result in differences from quarter to quarter in the amount of realized gains or losses on this\nportfolio.\nOther noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased $7.7 million, or 90.0%, compared to the same period in 2023,\ndriven by a $4.0 million increase in company-owned life insurance income, a $1.1 million gain on the sale of a building, a $0.9 million increase in syndication\nfees, and a $0.7 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income. For the nine-month period, other noninterest income increased $7.3 million, or 18.2%,\ncompared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a $2.1 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income, a $1.5 million increase in company-\nowned life insurance income, a gain on sale of land of $1.8 million during the first quarter, a gain of $1.1 million on the sale of a building in the third quarter,\nand increases of $0.9 million in both syndication fees and foreign currency valuation. These increases are offset by a decrease in derivative income of $1.9\nmillion.\nTable 5\nSUMMARY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE (unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Dollar Percent\nSeptember 30, Change Change\n2024 2023 24-23 24-23\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 146,984 $ 133,380 $ 13,604 10.2%\nOccupancy, net 12,274 12,283 (9) (0.1)\nEquipment 15,988 17,204 (1,216) (7.1)\nSupplies and services 4,967 3,213 1,754 54.6\nMarketing and business development 6,817 6,631 186 2.8\nProcessing fees 29,697 26,016 3,681 14.1\nLegal and consulting 9,518 7,230 2,288 31.6\nBankcard 12,482 8,852 3,630 41.0\nAmortization of other intangible assets 1,917 2,124 (207) (9.7)\nRegulatory fees 4,686 6,153 (1,467) (23.8)\nOther 7,124 8,355 (1,231) (14.7)\nTotal noninterest expense $ 252,454 $ 231,441 $ 21,013 9.1%\n67\nNine Months Ended Dollar Percent\nSeptember 30, Change Change\n2024 2023 24-23 24-23\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 432,851 $ 419,190 $ 13,661 3.3%\nOccupancy, net 36,267 36,206 61 0.2\nEquipment 48,094 52,139 (4,045) (7.8)\nSupplies and services 11,672 11,283 389 3.4\nMarketing and business development 19,440 19,090 350 1.8\nProcessing fees 87,334 75,828 11,506 15.2\nLegal and consulting 33,978 21,574 12,404 57.5\nBankcard 34,867 24,292 10,575 43.5\nAmortization of other intangible assets 5,788 6,539 (751) (11.5)\nRegulatory fees 26,649 17,827 8,822 49.5\nOther 19,385 25,198 (5,813) (23.1)\nTotal noninterest expense $ 756,325 $ 709,166 $ 47,159 6.6%\nNoninterest expense increased $21.0 million, or 9.1%, and increased $47.2 million, or 6.6%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

Employee benefits expense increased $4.6 million, or 22.7%, and increased\n$2.3 million, or 2.9%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by changes in\ndeferred compensation expense and medical benefit expense.\nEquipment expense decreased $1.2 million, or 7.1%, and $4.0 million, or 7.8%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreased software expense.\nProcessing fees increased $3.7 million, or 14.1%, and $11.5 million, or 15.2%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased software subscription costs.\nLegal and consulting expense increased $2.3 million, or 31.6%, and $12.4 million, or 57.5%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to expense related to the recently announced acquisition of HTLF.\nBankcard expense increased $3.6 million, or 41.0%, and $10.6 million, or 43.5%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily driven by higher administrative expense.\nRegulatory fees decreased $1.5 million, or 23.8%, and increased $8.8 million, or 49.5%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily driven by adjustments to the FDIC special assessment liability.\nOther expense decreased $1.2 million, or 14.7%, and $5.8 million, or 23.1%, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

The\nincrease in the effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily attributable to a smaller portion of income being earned from tax-exempt municipal securities and higher\nnon-deductible acquisition costs in 2024.\nStrategic Lines of Business\nThe Company has strategically aligned its operations into the following three reportable Business Segments: Commercial Banking, Institutional Banking,\nand Personal Banking. The Company’s senior executive officers regularly evaluate Business Segment financial results produced by the Company’s internal\nreporting system in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance for individual Business Segments. For comparability purposes, amounts in all\nperiods are based on methodologies in effect at September 30, 2024.

Noninterest expense increased\n$5.4 million, or 2.9%, primarily due to increases of $5.0 million in technology, service, and overhead expenses, $1.5 million in salaries and employee benefits,\nand $1.0 million in bankcard expense, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in operational losses.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nTotal assets of the Company increased $3.5 billion, or 7.9%, as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of\n$1.8 billion, or 7.8%, in loan balances and an increase of $1.4 billion, or 27.9%, in interest-bearing due from banks.\nTotal assets of the Company increased $6.0 billion, or 14.5%, as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in\ninterest-bearing due from banks of $3.0 billion, or 85.7%, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 9.2%, in loan balances, and an increase of $433.7 million, or 3.5% in\ntotal securities.\n71\nTable 9\nSELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nTotal assets $ 47,496,428 $ 41,464,682 $ 44,011,674\nLoans, net of unearned interest 24,995,967 22,884,513 23,176,904\nTotal securities 12,994,786 12,561,046 13,271,509\nInterest-bearing due from banks 6,601,866 3,556,076 5,159,802\nTotal earning assets 44,991,853 39,249,838 41,853,559\nTotal deposits 39,702,592 33,431,752 35,792,859\nTotal borrowed funds 3,458,055 4,440,370 4,302,891\nLoans represent the Company’s largest source of interest income. In addition to growing the commercial loan portfolio, management believes its middle\nmarket commercial business and its consumer business, including home equity and credit card loan products, are the market niches that represent its best\nopportunity to cross-sell fee-related services and generate additional noninterest income for the Company.\nActual loan balances totaled $25.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, and increased $1.8 billion, or 7.8%, compared to December 31, 2023, and increased\n$2.1 billion, or 9.2%, compared to September 30, 2023. Compared to December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans increased $887.1 million, or 10.0%,\ncommercial and industrial loans increased $741.7 million, or 7.5%, and credit card loans increased $157.8 million, or 37.2%. Compared to September 30, 2023,\ncommercial real estate loans increased $1.0 billion, or 11.4%, commercial and industrial loans increased $882.0 million, or 9.0%, consumer real estate loans\nincreased $186.6 million, or 6.4%, and credit card loans increased $131.2 million, or 29.1%. The increase in credit card loans in both periods is related to the\npurchase of $109.4 million in co-branded credit card receivables during the first quarter of 2024. See further information in Note 4, “Loans and Allowance for\nCredit Losses” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans comprised approximately 39.1% and 38.4%, respectively, of the\nCompany's loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than consumer real estate loans because they typically\nhave larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend\nupon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected\nby factors outside the borrower’s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations. In recent\nyears, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19\npandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options, which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office\nproperties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Due to these risks, the Company is actively monitoring its exposure to commercial real estate.\nGenerally, these loans are made for investment and real estate development or working capital and business expansion purposes and are primarily\nsecured by real estate with a maximum loan-to-value of 80%. Most of these properties are non-owner occupied and have guarantees as additional security. The\nCompany's investment CRE portfolio (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) totaled 27.7% and 26.5% of total Company loans as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average investment CRE loan was approximately $6.9 million and $5.8 million, as of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 90% are recourse loans as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These loans have an average\nloan-to-value of 57% as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce exposure to\nadverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Notwithstanding, commercial real estate loans, in general, may be more adversely impacted\nby conditions in the real estate market or the economy.\n72\nThe following table presents the Company's investment CRE (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) by industry. The table\nseparately discloses the top five industries as a percentage of the Company's loan portfolio as of either period presented, while the remainder are included in\n\"Other.\"\nTable 10\nInvestment CRE loans by industry as a percentage of total Company Loans\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIndustrial 8.1% 8.0%\nMultifamily 6.8 5.0\nOffice building 4.1 4.2\nHotel 2.0 2.0\nRetail 1.9 2.2\nOther 4.8 5.1\nTotal Investment CRE 27.7% 26.5%\nThe following table presents the Company's investment CRE (which includes non-owner occupied and construction loans) by state.

The Company is\nactively monitoring its exposure to office space in its non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. The average loan size in the Company's office\nportfolio was approximately $9.3 million and $9.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average loan-to-value of the\noffice portfolio was 64% as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and 84% are recourse loans as of the end of both periods. Further, only 23%\nand 30% of the Company's office portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is in central business districts, which have been more\nheavily impacted by the shift to remote work. The remainder of the Company's office portfolio is in suburban or medical properties.\nThe table below presents the Company's portfolio of office commercial real estate by the metropolitan statistical area (MSAs) in which the loan collateral\nis located.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk” in this report.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company’s investment portfolio contains trading, AFS, and HTM securities, as well as FRB stock, FHLB stock, and other miscellaneous\ninvestments. Investment securities totaled $13.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, and $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, and comprised 28.9% and 31.9%\nof the Company’s earning assets, respectively, as of those dates.\nThe Company’s AFS securities portfolio comprised 54.0% of the Company’s total securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 53.3% at December 31,\n2023. The Company’s AFS securities portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities. This liquidity can\nbe used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources. The average life of the AFS securities portfolio was 55.4 months at\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 52.6 months at December 31, 2023, and 61.7 months at September 30, 2023. In addition to providing a potential source of\nliquidity, the AFS securities portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity. The Company’s goal in the management of its AFS securities\nportfolio is to maximize return within the Company’s parameters of liquidity goals, interest rate risk, and credit risk.\nManagement expects collateral pledging requirements for public funds, loan demand, and deposit funding to be the primary factors impacting changes in\nthe level of AFS securities. There were $9.4 billion and $10.1 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S. Government deposits, other public deposits, certain\ntrust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company’s HTM securities portfolio consists of U.S. agency-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, general obligation bonds, and private\nplacement bonds. The HTM portfolio, net of the ACL, totaled $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The\naverage life of the HTM portfolio was 8.7 years at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.4 years at December 31, 2023, and 9.5 years at September 30, 2023.\nThe securities portfolio generates the Company’s second largest component of interest income. The securities portfolio achieved an average yield on a\ntax-equivalent basis of 2.93% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.64% for the same period in 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the AFS securities portfolio was $449.4 million, or 6.0% of the $7.5 billion amortized cost\nvalue, a decrease of $174.9 million as compared to December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized pre-tax net loss on the securities designated as\nHTM was $563.5 million, or 10.3% of amortized cost value, compared to $508.5 million at December 31, 2023. During 2022, the Company transferred\nsecurities with an amortized cost balance of $4.1 billion and a fair value of $3.8 billion from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer of securities\nwas made at fair value at the time of transfer. The\n74\nremaining balance of unrealized pre-tax losses related to transferred securities was $179.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and $207.2 million as of December\n31, 2023, and was included in the amortized cost balance of HTM securities. See further information in Note 5, “Securities” in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nDeposits and Borrowed Funds\nDeposits increased $3.9 billion, or 10.9%, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and increased $6.3 billion, or 18.8%, from September 30,\n2023 to September 30, 2024. Total interest-bearing balances increased $3.2 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $710.3 million from December\n31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $4.7 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.6 billion from September\n30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 32.3%, 33.9%, and 33.7% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nDeposits represent the Company’s primary funding source for its asset base. In addition to the core deposits garnered by the Company’s retail branch\nstructure, the Company continues to focus on its cash management services, as well as its trust and investment company servicing businesses, in order to attract\nand retain additional deposits. Management believes a strong core deposit composition is one of the Company’s key strengths given its competitive product\nmix.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were an estimated $28.6 billion of uninsured deposits, an increase of $4.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2023,\nand an increase of $7.9 billion as compared to September 30, 2023. Estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 72.2%, 68.2%, and 62.0% of total\ndeposits as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. A portion of these uninsured deposits represent affiliate deposits\nand collateralized deposits. Affiliate deposits represent deposit accounts owned by the wholly owned subsidiaries of UMB Financial Corporation that are on\ndeposit at UMB Bank, n.a. Collateralized deposits are public fund deposits or corporate trust deposits that are collateralized by high quality securities within the\ninvestment portfolio. Excluding affiliate deposits of $2.6 billion and collateralized deposits of $5.4 billion, the adjusted estimated uninsured deposits were $20.7\nbillion as of September 30, 2024. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits, as a percentage of total\ndeposits was approximately 52.2% as of September 30, 2024. The adjusted ratio of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate and collateralized deposits,\nas a percentage of total deposits was approximately 45.3% as of December 31, 2023, and 42.6% as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Company participates in the IntraFi Cash Service program, which allows its customers to place deposits into the program to receive reciprocal FDIC\ninsurance coverage. The Company had $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.3 billion of deposits in the program as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nLong-term debt totaled $384.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $383.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and $382.8 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nIn September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million,\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective\nrate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027.\nIn September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million,\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective\nrate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025.\nThe remainder of the Company’s long-term debt was assumed from the acquisition of Marquette Financial Companies (Marquette) and consists of debt\nobligations payable to four unconsolidated trusts (Marquette Capital\n75\nTrust I, Marquette Capital Trust II, Marquette Capital Trust III, and Marquette Capital Trust IV) that previously issued trust preferred securities. These long-\nterm debt obligations have an aggregate contractual balance of $103.1 million. Interest rates on trust preferred securities are tied to the three-month term SOFR\nwith spreads ranging from 133 basis points to 160 basis points and reset quarterly. The trust preferred securities have maturity dates ranging from January 2036\nto September 2036.\nThe Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which allows the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for general working\ncapital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company’s option either 1.40% above SOFR or 1.75% below the prime rate on\nthe date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had no advances outstanding on this revolving line of credit.\nShort-term debt totaled $1.1 billion as September 30, 2024 and consisted of a short-term borrowing with the FHLB of Des Moines for $250.0 million and\nan $800.0 million borrowing with the BTFP. The FHLB borrowing had an interest rate of 5.47% and matured in October 2024. The BTFP borrowing had a rate\nof 4.76% and was repaid in advance of its maturity in October 2024. See further information in Note 7, “Borrowed Funds” in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, $2.1 billion at December 31,\n2023, and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2023. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving the exchange of investment funds by the customer for\nsecurities by the Company under an agreement to repurchase the same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date.\nCapital and Liquidity\nThe Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to\nfunding sources under favorable terms, and enhances the Company’s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of\nliquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended\nliability maturities. The Company manages capital for each subsidiary based upon the subsidiary’s respective risks and growth opportunities as well as\nregulatory requirements.\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $3.5 billion at September 30, 2024, a $435.1 million increase as compared to December 31, 2023, and a $728.8 million\nincrease compared to September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorized, at its April 30, 2024 and April 26, 2022 meetings, the repurchase of up to one million shares and two\nmillion shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock during the twelve months following each meeting (each a Repurchase Authorization). On July 25,\n2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company's common stock, which terminated on April 30,\n2024. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did not repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to\nany of its announced Repurchase Authorizations, but did acquire shares pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs.\nAt the Company’s quarterly board meeting, the Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share quarterly cash dividend payable on January 2, 2025, to\nshareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2024.\nOn April 28, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with HTLF, a Delaware corporation and Blue Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement and the merger were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the\nCompany and HTLF. Pending regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of the Company and HTLF, the merger is expected to close in the first\nquarter of 2025. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, HTLF stockholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.55 shares of the Company’s common\nstock for each share of HTLF stock, with a total market value of approximately $2.0 billion.\n76\nAdditionally, on April 29, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it entered into a forward\nsale agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. or its affiliate to issue 2,800,000 shares of its common stock for approximate proceeds of $201.6 million. The\nunderwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable within 30 days of April 28,\n2024. The underwriters exercised this option in full on April 30, 2024, upon which the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement relating to\nthe 420,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The forward purchase agreement is classified as an equity instrument under ASC 815-40, Contracts in\nEntity’s Own Equity.\nThrough the Company’s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines, the Company owns $21.4 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional\nliquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Company’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at\nthe FHLB. The Company had a short-term advance for $250.0 million outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2024. This borrowing\nmatured in October 2024. Additionally, during 2024, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure\ndeposits. This letter of credit expired in October 2024, was renewed, and will expire in January 2025. The Company’s remaining borrowing capacity with the\nFHLB was $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's BTFP as of September 30, 2024. This\nborrowing was repaid in October 2024 in advance of its maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s remaining borrowing capacity with the BTFP was\n$18.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window was $11.8 billion.\nIn addition to borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity\nof $11.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of September 30, 2024.\nRisk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial\ninstitution’s assets. The Company has implemented the Basel III regulatory capital rules adopted by the FRB. Basel III capital rules include a minimum ratio of\ncommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. A financial institution’s total capital is also\nrequired to equal at least 8% of risk-weighted assets.\nThe risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit\nand binding loan commitments) are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk\nweightings. The Company is also required to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 4%. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of tier 1 core\ncapital to total average assets, less goodwill and intangibles.\nU.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations\nthe option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that\nprovides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss\nmethodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company elected this alternative option instead of the one described\nin the December 2018 rule.\n77\nThe Company's capital position as of September 30, 2024 is summarized in the table below and exceeded regulatory requirements.\nTable 13\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nRATIOS 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.22% 10.77% 11.22% 10.77%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 11.22 10.77 11.22 10.77\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 13.14 12.68 13.14 12.68\nLeverage ratio 8.58 8.55 8.58 8.55\nReturn on average assets 1.01 0.97 1.01 0.95\nReturn on average equity 12.63 13.25 13.13 13.18\nAverage equity to assets 7.99 7.32 7.67 7.17\nThe Company's per share data is summarized in the table below.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nPer Share Data 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEarnings – basic $ 2.25 $ 1.99 $ 6.59 $ 5.76\nEarnings – diluted 2.23 1.98 6.56 5.73\nCash dividends 0.39 0.38 1.17 1.14\nDividend payout ratio 17.3% 19.1% 17.8% 19.8%\nBook value $ 72.45 $ 57.83 $ 72.45 $ 57.83\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company’s main off-balance sheet arrangements are loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of credit, futures contracts and forward\nexchange contracts, which have maturity dates rather than payment due dates. See Note 10, “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on these arrangements. The level of the outstanding commitments could be impacted by volatility in\nthe economic markets and governmental responses to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints. These changing conditions could have\nimpacts on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company for the remainder of the year\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to customers and\nsuppliers, allowance for credit losses, bad debts, investments, financing operations, long-lived assets, taxes, other contingencies, and litigation. Management\nbases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from the recorded estimates.\nA summary of critical accounting policies is listed in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nsection of the Form 10-K.\n78\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management\nMarket risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the\nresult of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange prices, commodity prices, or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market\nrisk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading.\nThe Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The\nfollowing discussion of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the\ninstruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company’s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. To minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and\nexposure levels to economic losses, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines\nestablished by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board. The ALCO is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with\nasset/liability management policies, including interest rate exposure. The Company’s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate\nrisk is the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis. The Company also uses a Net Portfolio Value model to measure market value risk under various rate\nchange scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific\npoints in time. On a limited basis, the Company uses hedges such as swaps, rate floors, floor spreads, and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on\ncertain loans, securities, and trust preferred securities. See further information in Note 11 “Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nOverall, the Company manages interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level\nof interest rate and credit risk, remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability, liquidity, interest rate risk, and credit risk.\nNet Interest Income Modeling\nThe Company’s primary interest rate risk tool, the Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis, measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate\nchanges on net interest income and net interest margin. This analysis incorporates all of the Company’s assets and liabilities together with assumptions that\nreflect the current interest rate environment. Through these simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 200-basis-point upward or\na 300-basis-point downward gradual change (e.g. ramp) and immediate change (e.g. shock) of market interest rates over a two year period. In ramp scenarios,\nrates change gradually for a one-year period and remain constant in year two. In shock scenarios, rates change immediately and the change is sustained for the\nremainder of the two-year scenario horizon. Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, management outlook\nand repricing strategies. Asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes. The\nresults of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results on a\nregular basis.\nTable 14 shows the net interest income increase or decrease over the next two years as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 based on hypothetical changes in\ninterest rates and a constant sized balance sheet with runoff being replaced.\n79\nTable 14\nMARKET RISK (unaudited)\nHypothetical change in interest rate – Rate Ramp\nYear One Year Two\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPercentage Percentage Percentage Percentage\nChange in basis points change change change change\n200 (3.3)% (2.1)% 1.9% 2.4%\n100 (1.7) (1.0) 0.8 1.2\nStatic — — — —\n(100) 3.3 1.1 1.4 (1.3)\n(200) 6.6 2.4 2.6 (2.2)\n(300) 9.9 n/a 2.5 n/a\nHypothetical change in interest rate – Rate Shock\nYear One Year Two\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPercentage Percentage Percentage Percentage\nChange in basis points change change change change\n200 (2.0)% 1.2% 3.7% 5.6%\n100 (1.1) 0.6 1.7 2.8\nStatic — — — —\n(100) 3.2 (0.6) 0.2 (2.9)\n(200) 6.3 (0.7) (0.0) (5.7)\n(300) 8.4 n/a (2.2) n/a\nThe Company is liability sensitive to changes in interest rates in the next year. Net interest income is predicted to decrease in all upward rate scenarios\nand increase in all downward rate scenarios. In year two, net interest income is predicted to increase in all upward rate scenarios. In down rate scenarios net\ninterest income is predicted to increase in rate ramp scenarios and decrease in rate shock scenarios except for the down 100bps shock scenario. The Company’s\nability to price deposits consistent with its historical approach is a key assumption in these scenarios.\nTrading Account\nThe Company carries securities in a trading account that is maintained according to Board-approved policy and procedures. The policy limits the amount\nand type of securities that can be carried in the trading account, requires compliance with any limits under applicable law and regulations, and mandates the use\nof a value-at-risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters. The risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset\nby utilizing financial instruments including exchange-traded financial futures as well as short sales of U.S. Treasury and Corporate securities. The trading\nsecurities and related hedging instruments are marked-to-market daily. The trading account had a balance of $35.8 million as of September 30, 2024, $18.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, and $24.5 million as of September 30, 2023. Securities sold not yet purchased (i.e., short positions) totaled $11.3 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, $8.0 million as of December 31, 2023, and $9.7 million at September 30, 2023 and are classified within the Other liabilities line of the\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n80\nThe Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading. The\ndiscussion in Table 14 above of interest rate risk, however, combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading, because\nthe instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the Company’s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial.\nOther Market Risk\nThe Company has minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts. See Note 10 “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees”\nin the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. The Company utilizes a centralized\ncredit administration function, which provides information on the Bank’s risk levels, delinquencies, an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure.\nLoan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards. In addition, the Company has an internal loan review\nstaff that operates independently of the Bank. This review team performs periodic examinations of the Bank’s loans for credit quality, documentation and loan\nadministration. The respective regulatory authorities governing the Bank also review loan portfolios.\nA primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and\nrestructured loans on nonaccrual. The Company’s nonperforming loans increased $2.2 million to $19.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to September\n30, 2023, and increased $6.1 million, compared to December 31, 2023.\nThe Company had $1.9 million and $1.7 million of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans past\ndue more than 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $7.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 million at September 30, 2023 and $3.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.\nA loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90 days or more and/or when management has considerable doubt about the\nborrower’s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when received in cash.\nCertain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective\nborrowers. The Company had $200 thousand of restructured loans at September 30, 2024, $3.2 million at September 30, 2023, and $548 thousand at December\n31, 2023.\n81\nTable 15\nLOAN QUALITY (unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nNonaccrual loans $ 19,248 $ 14,519 $ 12,828\nRestructured loans on nonaccrual 43 2,523 384\nTotal nonperforming loans 19,291 17,042 13,212\nOther real estate owned 1,851 — 1,738\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 21,142 $ 17,042 $ 14,950\nLoans past due 90 days or more $ 7,133 $ 3,044 $ 3,111\nRestructured loans accruing 157 665 164\nAllowance for credit losses on loans 248,907 221,462 219,738\nRatios:\nNonperforming loans as a percent of loans 0.08% 0.07% 0.06%\nNonperforming assets as a percent of loans plus other real estate owned 0.08 0.07 0.06\nNonperforming assets as a percent of total assets 0.04 0.04 0.03\nLoans past due 90 days or more as a percent of loans 0.03 0.01 0.01\nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a percent of loans 1.00 0.97 0.95\nAllowance for credit losses on loans as a multiple of nonperforming loans 12.90x 13.00x 16.63x\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity represents the Company’s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional\nfunds. The Company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and\ngrowth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, the Company believes public confidence is generated through profitable\noperations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity\nof assets, which include $7.0 billion of high-quality securities available for sale as of September 30, 2024. The liquidity of the Company and the Bank is also\nenhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits. Additionally, management believes it can raise debt or equity capital in the future,\nshould the need arise.\nAnother factor affecting liquidity is the amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements. All customer\nrepurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security. The U.S. Government, other public entities, and certain trust depositors require the Company\nto pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the FDIC-insured deposit limitations. These pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the\nrelated security cannot otherwise be disposed of due to the pledging restriction. There were $9.4 billion and $10.1 billion of securities pledged to secure U.S.\nGovernment deposits, other public deposits, certain trust deposits, derivative transactions, and repurchase agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\nThe Company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity. These commitments include unused commitments to extend credit,\nstandby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The total amount of these commercial commitments at September 30, 2024\nwas $18.8 billion. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily\nrepresent the future cash requirements of the Company.\nThe Company’s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, operating expenses, and treasury stock purchases.\nManagement fees and dividends received from bank and non-bank subsidiaries traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected\nto be sufficient in the future. The Bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the Company. For the most part, the Bank can pay\ndividends at least equal to its current year’s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval. The\n82\nCompany also uses cash to inject capital into its bank and non-bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as fund strategic initiatives.\nIn September 2022, the Company issued $110.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2032. The Company received $107.9 million,\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 6.25% and an effective\nrate of 6.64%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2027.\nIn September 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate subordinated notes due in September 2030. The Company received $197.7 million,\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding, among other uses, contributing Tier 1 capital into the Bank. The subordinated notes were issued with a fixed-to-fixed rate of 3.70% and an effective\nrate of 3.93%, due to issuance costs, with an interest rate reset date of September 2025.\nTo enhance general working capital needs, the Company has a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which allows the Company to\nborrow up to $30.0 million for general working capital purposes. The interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the Company’s option, either 1.4%\nabove SOFR or 1.75% below the prime rate on the date of an advance. The Company pays a 0.4% unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of\ncredit. The Company had no advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company is a member bank of the FHLB. The Company owns $21.4 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding\nsources through FHLB advances. The Company’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Company places at the FHLB. The\nCompany had a $250.0 million short-term advance outstanding at FHLB of Des Moines as of September 30, 2024, at an interest rate of 5.47%. This borrowing\nmatured in October 2024. Additionally, during 2024, the FHLB of Des Moines issued a letter of credit for $150.0 million on behalf of the Company to secure\ndeposits. This letter of credit expired in October 2024, was renewed, and will expire in January 2025. The Company’s remaining borrowing capacity with the\nFHLB was $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company had an $800.0 million short-term borrowing outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank's BTFP as of September 30, 2024 at an interest\nrate of 4.76%. This borrowing was repaid in October 2024 in advance of its maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s remaining borrowing capacity\nwith the BTFP was $18.0 million and its remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window was $11.8 billion.\nIn addition to borrowing capacity with the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as described above, the Company had additional liquidity\nof $11.4 billion available via cash, unpledged bond collateral, the federal funds market, and the IntraFi Cash Service program as of September 30, 2024.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by\nthird parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions\nby employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned\ninterruptions in service. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a\nresult of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. The Company must comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe Company operates in many markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions. In the\nevent of a breakdown in internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face\nregulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation. In order to address this risk, management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of\nproviding proper transaction authorization and execution, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data.\n83\nThe Company maintains systems of internal controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the Company’s operations.\nThese systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company’s financial strength, the environment in which it\noperates, and considering factors such as competition and regulation. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies\nrelating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed on a uniform basis. In certain cases, the Company has experienced losses from operational risk.\nSuch losses have included the effects of operational errors that the Company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income. While there\ncan be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls,\nsystems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, requires the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to make certain certifications under\nthis Form 10-Q with respect to the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The Company has a Code of\nEthics that expresses the values that drive employee behavior and maintains the Company’s commitment to the highest standards of ethics.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of\nthe Company's “disclosure controls and procedures” (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nfor ensuring that the Company’s SEC filings are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period required and that information required to\nbe disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nduring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting.\n84\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are named defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management,\nafter consultation with legal counsel, none of these lawsuits are expected to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or\ncash flows of the Company.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere were no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in response to Item 1A to Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or in response to Item 1A to Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\nITEM 2.

Under the terms of the Company's share-based incentive programs, the Company accepts previously owned\nshares of common stock surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with equity compensation. These purchases do not count against the maximum value of shares remaining available\nfor purchase under Repurchase Authorizations.\n(2) Includes shares acquired under the Board of Directors approved Repurchase Authorization(s).\nOn July 25, 2023, the Company announced a plan to repurchase up to one million shares of common stock, which terminated April 30, 2024. On April\n30, 2024, the Company announced a plan to repurchase up to one million shares of common stock, which will terminate on April 29, 2025. The Company has\nnot made any repurchases other than through the Repurchase Authorizations, but did acquire share pursuant to the Company's share-based incentive programs.\nThe Company is not currently engaging in repurchases. In the future, it may determine to resume repurchases. All share purchases pursuant to the Repurchase\nAuthorizations are intended to be within the scope of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for purchases in a\ngiven day if the Company satisfies the manner, timing and volume conditions of the rule when purchasing its own shares of common stock.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn September 13, 2024, three foundations and trusts that are related interests of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Mariner Kemper adopted a\nsingle, pre-arranged stock sale plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) (Rule 10b5-1) under the Exchange Act for the sale of shares of the Company’s common\nstock (the “2025\n85\nPlan”). The 2025 Plan was entered into during an open trading window in accordance with the Company’s requirements regarding transactions in the Company’s\nsecurities and is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1. The 2025 Plan provides for the monthly sale of an initial number of shares\nof the Company’s common stock once the market price of the Company’s common stock meets or exceeds certain minimum threshold prices as specified in the\n2025 Plan. Should the market price of the Company’s shares meet or exceed secondary and tertiary pricing thresholds as specified in the 2025 Plan, up to double\nand triple the initial number of shares in the aggregate may be sold in that month, respectively. Sales under the 2025 Plan may occur beginning in January of\n2025 (after conclusion of the applicable cooling off period following adoption of the 2025 Plan) and end no later than December 31, 2025. The aggregate\nnumber of shares of common stock of the Company that will be available for sale under the 2025 Plan will vary depending on the market price achieved but will\nnot exceed a maximum of 105,024 shares in aggregate.\n86\nITEM 6.
