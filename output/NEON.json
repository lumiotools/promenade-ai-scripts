(NASDAQ: NEON) (“Neonode” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The financial results relate to continuing operations, which means Neonode’s licensing business as the products business has been reclassified to discontinued operations, following the decision in Q4 2023 to focus solely on the Company’s licensing business.\n\n**FINANCIAL SUMMARY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024**\n\n  * Revenues from continuing operations of $0.8 million, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Operating expenses from continuing operations of $2.0 million, a decrease of 2.7% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations of $1.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $1.1 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same period in the prior year.\n  * Cash used by operations of $1.3 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in the prior year.\n  * Cash and accounts receivable of $18.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $17.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**FINANCIAL SUMMARY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024**\n\n  * Revenue from continuing operations of $2.5 million, a decrease of 21.0% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Operating expenses from continuing operations of $7.2 million, an increase of 2.9% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations of $4.4 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to $3.5 million, or $0.22 per share, for the same period in the prior year.\n  * Cash used by operations of $4.4 million compared to $4.1 million for the same period in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024**\n\n  * Several ongoing discussions with potential customers regarding Touch Sensor Module (“TSM”) technology and the MultiSensing® platform.\n  * TSM technology agreement with NEXTY Electronics, an electronics-trading company within the Toyota Tsusho Group, for sensor development and manufacturing of the next-generation amusement machines for a leading manufacturer in Japan’s amusement market.\n  * TSM technology agreement with YesAR to develop and build holographic infotainment solutions for its customers in the automotive and elevator segments, as well as other market segments.\n\n\n\n“Our revenues from the continuing licensing business decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year. However, non-recurring engineering revenues related to our new lines of business increased and were mainly attributable to the driver monitoring system (“DMS”) project with the original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of commercial vehicles customer that we announced at the end of last year. Licensing revenues from legacy customers within printer and passenger car touch applications decreased compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to lower demand for their products. Cash used by operations decreased in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, as we discontinued component purchases after phasing out TSM manufacturing,” said Fredrik Nihlén, Neonode’s interim President and CEO and CFO.\n\n“We remain positive toward the prospects of generating new projects and business with our driver and in-cabin monitoring solutions, which continue to generate positive attention from OEMs and suppliers to the automotive industry. Our flexible and scalable approach to driver and in-cabin monitoring presents manufacturers and their suppliers with a cost-effective and efficient platform for securing compliance and automotive innovation for years to come. We also see a growing market interest in licensing our cost-effective and proven touch interaction solutions,” concluded Mr. Nihlén.\n\n**FINANCIAL OVERVIEW FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024**\n\nRevenues from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $0.8 million, a 0.2% decrease compared to the same period in 2023. License revenues were $0.7 million, a decrease of 12.6% compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to lower demand for our legacy customers products within printer and passenger car touch applications offset by revenues from our new licensing customers.\n\nRevenues from non-recurring engineering for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.1 million, a 2,575.0% increase compared to the same period in 2023, mainly attributable to the DMS project with the commercial vehicle OEM customer that was announced at the end of 2023.\n\nOur operating expenses from continuing operations decreased by 2.7% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower payroll and related costs offset by higher professional fees and advertising costs.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.07 per share for the same period in 2023.\n\nCash used by operations was $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of component purchases following the phaseout of TSM manufacturing.\n\nCash and accounts receivable totaled $18.6 million and working capital for continuing operations was $17.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $16.1 million and $16.8 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

(NASDAQ: NEON) (“Neonode”) is pleased to announce a new license agreement for an evolution of its licensable Touch Sensor Module (“TSM”) technology. NEXTY Electronics Corporation (“NEXTY Electronics”), an electronics trading company of the Toyota Tsusho Group, has selected Neonode’s TSM technology for sensor development and manufacturing of the next-generation amusement machines for a leading manufacturer in Japan’s amusement market. The agreement includes an upfront technology access fee and future royalties and is estimated to have a value of US$2–3 million over the next four to five years.\n\nNEXTY Electronics chose to license Neonode’s latest TSM offering, primarily based on surface-mount technology (“SMT”), which enables touch interactivity on larger displays, surfaces and projected planes at a lower cost than alternative solutions. Easily integrated using a single-sided TSM sensor, Neonode’s touch interaction technology delivers exceptional performance and value to any touch-operated application. NEXTY Electronics will manufacture the TSMs in Japan for delivery to companies in the Japanese amusement market as well as in other markets that desire high quality, cost-effective touch functionality on large displays and surfaces.\n\n“After extensive evaluation, we have found Neonode's SMT-based TSM to be a great fit for the Japanese amusement market, enhancing operational performance without compromising the beauty of the content displayed on the screen. We have worked closely and productively with Neonode for years and look forward to strengthening our partnership further with this license agreement,” said Mikio Takano, NEXTY Electronics’ Executive Officer.\n\n“We are excited to deepen our relationship with NEXTY Electronics, a trusted, value-added reseller of Neonode’s products, as we continue our transformation into a company that is fully focused on technology licensing. NEXTY Electronics is intimately familiar with our products from its time as a TSM reseller, and its decision to license and manufacture our TSM technology is a vote of confidence for our licensing-focused business strategy and innovative licensable technologies,” said Fredrik Nihlén, Neonode’s interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**For more information, please contact:**\n\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Fredrik Nihlén E-mail: fredrik.nihlen@neonode.com Phone: +46 703 97 21 09\n\nVice President Marketing & Sales Johan Swartz E-mail: johan.swartz@neonode.com Phone: +46 707 64 35 44\n\n[Download PDF](https://mb.cision.com/Main/17297/4042522/3021101.pdf)[Read at Cision](https://news.cision.com/neonode/r/nexty-electronics-selects-neonode-s-touch-sensor-module-technology-for-the-japanese-amusement-market,c4042522)\n"

(NASDAQ: NEON) (“Neonode” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**FINANCIAL SUMMARY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024:**\n\n• Revenues of $1.4 million, an increase of 18.7% compared to the same period in the prior year. • Operating expenses of $2.7 million, a decrease of 1.6% compared to the same period in the prior year. • Net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to $1.5 million, or $0.10 per share, for the same period in the prior year. • Cash used by operations of $1.2 million compared to $0.6 million for the same period in the prior year. • Cash and accounts receivable of $14.4 million as of June 30, 2024 compared to $17.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**FINANCIAL SUMMARY FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024:**\n\n• Revenue of $2.4 million, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the same period in the prior year. • Operating expenses of $5.6 million, an increase of 0.9% compared to the same period in the prior year. • Net loss of $3.8 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.19 per share, for the same period in the prior year. • Cash used by operations of $3.1 million compared to $2.3 million for the same period in the prior year.\n\n**COMMENTS OF THE INTERIM PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“CEO”) AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (“CFO”)**\n\n“Our revenues increased in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year. Non-recurring engineering revenues increased and were mainly attributable to the ongoing Driver Monitoring System (“DMS”) project with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) of commercial vehicles customer that was announced at the end of last year. Product sales also increased in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year, mainly as a result of last time buy orders from customers to secure supplies, following our decision to focus solely on licensing going forward and to phase out our products business. Licensing revenues decreased compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to the demand for our legacy customers’ products being lower. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year declined and was the result of increased cost of revenue due to increased product sales and non-recurring revenues combined with decreased licensing revenues. Although our operating expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, the decline in gross margin led to a higher net loss,” said Fredrik Nihlén, Neonode’s interim President and CEO and CFO.\n\n“Our driver and in-cabin monitoring solutions keep attracting attention, which is positive. We find this promising and believe that our solution is not only competitive but also scalable and flexible, making the solution attractive to both commercial vehicle and passenger car manufacturers. We also keep seeing interesting licensing opportunities for our touch and touchless human-machine interaction offerings in addition to the first touch sensor module technology license agreement announced earlier this year,” concluded Mr. Nihlén.\n\n**FINANCIAL OVERVIEW FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2024**\n\nRevenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $1.4 million, an 18.7% increase compared to the same period in 2023. License revenues were $0.6 million, a decrease of 43.9% compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was caused by lower sales volumes for our customers during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. \n\nRevenues from product sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $0.6 million, a 641.7% increase compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to last time buy orders from customers. \n\nRevenues from non-recurring engineering for the second quarter of 2024 were $0.2 million, a 750.0% increase compared to the same period in 2023, mainly attributable to the DMS project with the commercial vehicle OEM customer that was announced at the end of last year. \n\nGross margin related to products was 26.0% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 66.7% in the same period in 2023. The gross margin for products for the second quarter in 2024 was impacted by a one-time cost of $8,000 related to an impairment loss on inventory due to the phasing out of the manufacturing of touch sensor modules.\n\nOur operating expenses decreased by 1.6% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower payroll and related costs offset by higher professional fees. Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.10 per share for the same period in 2023. Cash used by operations was $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily the result of component purchases in the second quarter of 2024 and the timing of customer payments. Cash and accounts receivable totaled $14.4 million and working capital was $13.2 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $17.1 million and $16.8 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**For more information, please contact:**\n\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Fredrik Nihlén E-mail: fredrik.nihlen@neonode.com Phone: +46 703 97 21 09\n\n[Download PDF](https://mb.cision.com/Main/17297/4022393/2937390.pdf)[Read at Cision](https://news.cision.com/neonode/r/neonode-reports-quarter-ended-june-30--2024-financial-results,c4022393)\n"

(NASDAQ: NEON) is pleased to announce the first license agreement for its Touch Sensor Module (“TSM”) technology following the decision in December 2023 to transform its TSM business to a licensing business model. YesAR has selected the Neonode TSM technology for the development and manufacturing of holographic infotainment solutions. The agreement includes an upfront technology access fee and future royalties.\n\nTo further strengthen its offering, YesAR, a Chinese pioneer in the development of holographic display technology and a provider of a new generation of intelligent display and interactive systems, will license the Neonode Touch Sensor Module technology to develop and build holographic infotainment solutions for its customers in the automotive and elevator sectors, as well as in other market segments.\n\n“We are excited to see momentum for our TSM technology as we are transforming from a product business to a technology licensing business. Our license agreement with YesAR ensures that our TSM technology remains a cornerstone technology in the growing market of holographic interfaces and is a testament to our continuing commitment to technological leadership and innovation through licensing,” Fredrik Nihlén, Neonode’s interim President and CEO and CFO, said.\n\n“We have worked together with YesAR since 2020 and are encouraged by their steadfast belief in the market potential for Neonode TSM-based holographic solutions, now as a technology licensee. We look forward to further enhancing our close relationship with YesAR as they license our technology and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that our technology platform will enable for YesAR and its customers,” Johan Swartz, Neonode’s Vice President Marketing & Sales, said.\n\nNeonode’s patented TSM technology utilizes Neonode’s revolutionary zForce® optical sensing technology platform to detect touch input or objects across an invisible infrared projected plane. Leveraging Neonode’s state-of-the-art zForce infrared technology, the Touch Sensor Module solution delivers incredible touch accuracy in any application that requires touch input, including contactless touch interaction in midair with projected holographic images as well as rugged touch on surfaces and displays. Easily integrated using a single-sided Touch Sensor Module sensor or a full-frame zForce implementation, Neonode’s licensable touch interaction technology platforms deliver exceptional performance and value to any touch-operated application.\n\n**For more information, please contact:**\n\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Fredrik Nihlén E-mail: fredrik.nihlen@neonode.com Phone: +46 703 97 21 09\n\nVice President Marketing & Sales Johan Swartz E-mail: johan.swartz@neonode.com Phone: +46 707 64 35 44\n\n[Download PDF](https://mb.cision.com/Main/17297/3986058/2814424.pdf)[Read at Cision](https://news.cision.com/neonode/r/neonode-signs-first-license-agreement-for-touch-sensor-module--tsm--technology,c3986058)\n"

(NASDAQ: NEON) (“Neonode” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**FINANCIAL SUMMARY FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024:**\n\n  * Revenue of $1.0 million, a decrease of 19.1% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Operating expenses of $2.9 million, an increase of 3.3% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to $1.4 million, or $0.09 per share, for the same period in the prior year.\n  * Cash used by operations of $1.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period in the prior year.\n  * Cash and accounts receivable of $15.3 million as of March 31, 2024 compared to $17.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**THE PRESIDENT & CEO’S COMMENTS**\n\n“Our revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year. Following the announcement of our change in strategy, with full focus on our licensing business and a phase-out of our products business, product sales have increased as a result of last time buy orders. Non-recurring engineering revenues also increased in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to a new potential Touch Sensor Module license project. At the same time, licensing revenues decreased compared to the same quarter last year. This is mainly due to the demand for our legacy customers’ products being lower, resulting in high inventory levels at some customers and thus lower revenues for Neonode,” said Fredrik Nihlén, Neonode’s interim President and CEO and CFO.\n\n“The award by a leading commercial vehicle Original Equipment Manufacturer to supply Driver Monitoring System software to their global range of commercial vehicles continues to generate increased interest in our driver and in-cabin monitoring solutions. This is encouraging, and we are confident that we have a competitive, scalable and flexible solution that is attractive to both commercial vehicle and passenger car manufacturers. We also see interesting licensing opportunities for our touch and touchless human-machine interaction offerings,” concluded Mr. Nihlén.\n\n**FINANCIAL OVERVIEW FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2024**\n\nNet revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 were $1.0 million, a 19.1% decrease compared to the same period in 2023. License revenues were $0.8 million, a decrease of 32.7% compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is caused by lower sales volumes for our customers during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nRevenues from product sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 were $0.2 million, a 96.1% increase compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to last time buy orders from customers.\n\nRevenues from non-recurring engineering for the first quarter of 2024 were $41,000, a 1,266.7% increase compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to a new potential Touch Sensor Module license project in Q1 2024.\n\nGross margin related to products was negative 90.0% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 53.9% in the same period in 2023. The gross margin for products for the first quarter in 2024 is impacted by a one-time cost related to an impairment loss on inventory due to the phasing out of the manufacturing of touch sensor modules.\n\nOur operating expenses increased by 3.3% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher marketing costs.\n\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.09 per share for the same period in 2023. Cash used by operations was $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily the result of component purchases in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCash and accounts receivable totaled $15.3 million and working capital was $14.7 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $17.1 million and $16.8 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**For more information, please contact:**\n\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Fredrik Nihlén E-mail: fredrik.nihlen@neonode.com Phone: +46 703 97 21 09\n\n[Download PDF](https://mb.cision.com/Main/17297/3975889/2786331.pdf)[Read at Cision](https://news.cision.com/neonode/r/neonode-reports-quarter-ended-march-31--2024-financial-results,c3975889)\n"
