First Guaranty attributed the decrease in the net interest margin to the increase in market interest rates that began in 2022 and continued through 2023 that increased the cost of liabilities. Loans as a percentage of average interest earning assets decreased to 80.0% at September 30, 2024 compared to 83.2% at September 30, 2023.\n  * Investment securities totaled $664.0 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $259.9 million when compared to $404.1 million at December 31, 2023.

Total loans net of unearned income are reduced by the allowance for credit losses which totaled $33.3 million at September 30, 2024 and $30.9 million at December 31, 2023, respectively.\n  * Nonaccrual loans increased $40.6 million to $65.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $25.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in total nonaccrual loans was concentrated primarily in one commercial real estate relationship that totaled $37.0 million. This relationship is comprised of five loans secured by real estate located in the Midwest. $13.9 million of this relationship was previously reported in 90 day plus but still accruing at December 31, 2023.\n  * At September 30, 2024, our largest non-performing assets were comprised of the following nonaccrual loans: (1) a $37.0 million non-farm non-residential loan relationship comprised of five loans with a specific reserve of $4.1 million; (2) a $3.3 million one- to four-family loan relationship; (3) a $1.8 million commercial real estate loan; (4) a commercial lease loan that totaled $1.7 million; (5) a commercial lease loan that totaled $1.6 million; (6) a $1.3 million one- to four-family loan relationship; and (7) a $1.3 million loan relationship that is classified as purchased credit deteriorated.\n  * First Guaranty charged off $2.6 million in loan balances during the third quarter of 2024.

This relationship had remaining principal balance of $1.3 million at September 30, 2024.\n  3.

The increase was due primarily to the recent issuance of new shares and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). AOCI is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, including unrealized losses on available for sale securities at the time of transfer to held to maturity.\n  * First Guaranty's Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.08 and $0.16 per common share in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.

The aggregate cash purchase price was $14.7 million. The sale-leaseback transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $13.2 million, or $10.4 million after tax. Aggregate first full year of rent expense under the Lease Agreements will be approximately $1.3 million pre-tax, or $1.0 million after tax.\n\n\n\n**About First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc.**\n\nFirst Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. is the holding company for First Guaranty Bank, a Louisiana state-chartered bank.

Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information\nand with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted\naccounting principles. The consolidated financial statements and the footnotes of First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. (\"First Guaranty\") thereto should be read in conjunction with\nthe audited consolidated financial statements and note disclosures for First Guaranty previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in First Guaranty's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary First Guaranty Bank (the \"Bank\"). All significant\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Those adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations at September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other interim period. The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term\nrelate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, and the valuation of\ninvestment securities.\n-10-\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2024\nNone.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nASU No. 2023-09, \"Improvements to Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\") is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily\nthrough changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early\nadoption is permitted. We do not expect it to have a material effect on First Guaranty's consolidated financial statements.\n-11-\nNote 3.

Management has the intent and ability to\nhold these debt securities until maturity or until anticipated recovery.\n-13-\nSecurities are evaluated for impairment from credit losses at least quarterly and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Consideration is\ngiven to (i) the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the recovery of contractual principal\nand interest and (iv) the intent and ability of First Guaranty to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nInvestment securities issued by the U.S. Government and Government sponsored enterprises with unrealized losses and the amount of unrealized losses on those investment\nsecurities that are the result of changes in market interest rates will not be credit impaired. First Guaranty has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery, which\nmay not be until maturity.\nCorporate debt securities in a loss position consist primarily of corporate bonds issued by businesses in the financial, insurance, utility, manufacturing, industrial, consumer\nproducts and oil and gas industries. There was one held to maturity corporate security with a credit related impairment loss at September 30, 2024. First Guaranty believes that\nthe remaining issuers will be able to fulfill the obligations of these securities based on evaluations described above. First Guaranty has the ability and intent to hold these\nsecurities until they recover, which could be at their maturity dates.\nThere were no charge-offs recognized on securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were no provisions for credit losses recognized on\nsecurities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor securities that have indications of credit related impairment, management analyzes future expected cash flows to determine if any credit related impairment is evident.\nEstimated cash flows are determined using management's best estimate of future cash flows based on specific assumptions. The assumptions used to determine the cash flows\nwere based on estimates of loss severity and credit default probabilities. Management reviews reports from credit rating agencies and public filings of issuers.\nAt September 30, 2024, First Guaranty's exposure to bond issuers that exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity is below:\nAt September 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Amortized Cost Fair Value\nU.S. Government Treasuries (U.S.) $ 255,310 $ 255,231\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) 32,275 27,355\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac-FHLMC) 98,950 75,173\nFederal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB) 139,099 115,843\nTotal $ 525,634 $ 473,602\n-14-\nNote 4.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment testing. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized\nover their useful lives. First Guaranty's goodwill is the difference in purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired from its acquisition of Homestead Bancorp in 2007,\nPremier Bancshares, Inc. in 2017 and Union Bancshares, Incorporated in 2019. Goodwill totaled $12.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. No impairment\ncharges have been recognized on First Guaranty's intangible assets since acquisition. Loan servicing assets totaled $0.4 million at September 30, 2024 and $0.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Other intangible assets recorded include core deposit intangibles, which are subject to amortization. The weighted-average amortization period remaining\nfor First Guaranty's core deposit intangibles is 4.5 years at September 30, 2024. The core deposits intangible reflect the value of deposit relationships, including the beneficial\nrates, which arose from acquisitions.\nNote 7.

Commitments and Contingencies\nOff-balance sheet commitments\nFirst Guaranty is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own\nexposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit. Those instruments\ninvolve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of\nthose instruments reflect the extent of the involvement in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of\ncredit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for\nbalance sheet instruments. Unless otherwise noted, collateral or other security is not required to support financial instruments with credit risk.\nBelow is a summary of the notional amounts of the financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nContract Amount\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommitments to Extend Credit $ 168,608 $ 304,218\nUnfunded Commitments under lines of credit $ 183,222 $ 214,546\nCommercial and Standby letters of credit $ 13,368 $ 13,971\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off- Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was a reversal of $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The ACL on off-balance-sheet credit\nexposures total $1.5 million at September 30, 2024 and $2.8 million at December 31, 2023 and is included in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nLitigation\nFirst Guaranty is subject to various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business. First Guaranty assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding\nlegal proceedings. Where it is probable that First Guaranty will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, First Guaranty records a liability in its\nconsolidated financial statements. First Guaranty does not record a loss if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable. First Guaranty Bank is a defendant in\na lawsuit alleging fault for a loss of funds by a customer related to fraud by a third party with a possible loss range of $0.0 million to $1.5 million. The Bank denies the\nallegations and intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, which is in early stages and no trial date has been set. No accrued liability has been recorded related to this\nlawsuit. First Guaranty settled a case in the third quarter of 2021 for $1.1 million. A receivable for $0.9 million was recorded for recovery by a claim against First Guaranty's\ninsurer. During the second quarter of 2024, First Guaranty received $0.5 million of the $0.9 million receivable. The remaining $0.4 million was written off. In the opinion of\nmanagement, neither First Guaranty nor First Guaranty Bank is currently involved in such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that the resolution is\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on First Guaranty’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes\nin these ordinary claims or litigation against First Guaranty or First Guaranty Bank could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition,\nregardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management’s attention, and may materially and adversely affect the reputation of First Guaranty\nand First Guaranty Bank, even if resolved favorably.\n-25-\nNote 9. Leases\nFirst Guaranty’s primary leasing activities relate to certain real estate leases of a portion of the main office, certain branches, and certain ATM locations. These leases have all\nbeen designated as operating leases. First Guaranty does not lease equipment under operating leases, and does not have leases designated as financing leases.\nOn June 28, 2024 First Guaranty sold three properties owned by it, two stand-alone branches and a portion of the headquarters building which also contains a branch, to a\npartnership owned by certain directors of First Guaranty. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $14.7 million. All of the properties are located in Louisiana.\nFirst Guaranty concurrently entered into absolute net lease agreements with the partnership under which First Guaranty will lease each of the properties. Each of the lease\nagreements has an initial term of 15 years with specified renewal options. Annual payments due under the leases total approximately $1.3 million. The sale-leaseback transaction\nresulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $13.3 million.\nFirst Guaranty recorded operating right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $11.5 million and $11.5 million, respectively.\nInformation concerning First Guaranty’s leases is as follows:\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWeighted-average lease term (in years) 14.5 4.8\nWeighted-average discount rate 7.9 % 2.9 %\nFirst Guaranty’s operating lease ROU assets were $11.7 million and $0.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the related operating lease\nliabilities were $11.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The ROU asset is included in Other Assets on the balance sheet, and the related operating lease liabilities are\nincluded in Other liabilities.\nOperating lease expense, including short-term leases, is included in occupancy expense in the amount of $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the nine months end September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Cash payment for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities of $0.4 million and $0.1 million were included in operating cash flows for the respective nine-month periods.\nThe following table reports minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases at September 30, 2024:\n(in thousands)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 352\n2025 1,406\n2026 1,406\n2027 1,406\n2028 1,351\nThereafter 13,519\nTotal lease payments 19,440\nLess: interest (7,689)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 11,751\n-26-\nNote 10. Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the\nabsence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Valuation techniques use certain inputs to arrive at fair value. Inputs to valuation\ntechniques are the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. They may be observable or unobservable. First Guaranty uses a fair value\nhierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The\nfair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices\nfor similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds or credit risks) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market\ndata by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\nA description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value follows, as well as the classification of such instruments within the valuation hierarchy.\nSecurities available for sale. Securities are classified within Level 1 where quoted market prices are available in an active market. Inputs include securities that have quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. If quoted market prices are unavailable, fair value is estimated using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, at which\npoint the securities would be classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Securities classified within Level 3 in First Guaranty's portfolio as of September 30, 2024 includes\ncorporate debt and municipal securities.\nLoan individually evaluated for impairment. Fair value is measured by either the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent (Level 2 or Level 3), or the\npresent value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate (Level 3). Fair value of the collateral is determined by appraisals or by independent\nvaluation.\nOther real estate owned. Properties are recorded at the balance of the loan or at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, whichever is less, at the date acquired. Fair\nvalues of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") are determined by sales agreement or appraisal, and costs to sell are based on estimation per the terms and conditions of the sales\nagreement or amounts commonly used in real estate transactions. Inputs include appraisal values or recent sales activity for similar assets in the property's market; thus, OREO\nmeasured at fair value would be classified within either Level 2 or Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nCertain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis including assets and liabilities related to reporting units measured at\nfair value in the testing of goodwill impairment, as well as intangible assets and other non-financial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment.\nThe following table summarizes financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, segregated by the level of the\nvaluation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAvailable for Sale Securities Fair Value Measurements Using:\nLevel 1: Quoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets $ 255,231 $ 49,830\nLevel 2: Significant Other Observable Inputs 77,328 23,172\nLevel 3: Significant Unobservable Inputs 10,039 10,483\nSecurities available for sale measured at fair value $ 342,598 $ 83,485\nFirst Guaranty's valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While the\nmethodologies used are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain\nfinancial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.\nThe change in Level 1 securities available for sale from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was due to a net increase in Treasury bills of $205.4 million. There were no\ntransfers between Level 2 and Level 3 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 securities available for sale from\nDecember 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024.\n-27-\nThe following table reconciles assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nLevel 3 Changes\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024\nBalance, beginning of year $ 10,483\nTotal gains or losses (realized/unrealized):\nIncluded in earnings —\nIncluded in other comprehensive income 79\nPurchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net (523)\nTransfers in and/or out of Level 3 —\nBalance as of end of period $ 10,039\nThere were no gains or losses for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to assets still held as of September 30, 2024.\nThe following table measures financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nsegregated by the level of valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:\n(in thousands) At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023\nFair Value Measurements Using: Loans Individually Evaluated for Impairment\nLevel 1: Quoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets $ — $ —\nLevel 2: Significant Other Observable Inputs — —\nLevel 3: Significant Unobservable Inputs 38,609 8,083\nLoans individually evaluated for impairment measured at fair value $ 38,609 $ 8,083\nFair Value Measurements Using: Other Real Estate Owned\nLevel 1: Quoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets $ — $ —\nLevel 2: Significant Other Observable Inputs 560 1,250\nLevel 3: Significant Unobservable Inputs 600 —\nOther real estate owned measured at fair value $ 1,160 $ 1,250\nASC 825-10 provides First Guaranty with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value option established by this statement permits First\nGuaranty to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been\nelected in earnings at each reporting date subsequent to implementation.\nFirst Guaranty has chosen not to elect the fair value option for any items that are not already required to be measured at fair value in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States.\n-28-\nNote 11. Financial Instruments\nFair value estimates are generally subjective in nature and are dependent upon a number of significant assumptions associated with each instrument or group of similar\ninstruments, including estimates of discount rates, risks associated with specific financial instruments, estimates of future cash flows and relevant available market information.\nFair value information is intended to represent an estimate of an amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between a willing buyer and\nseller engaging in an exchange transaction. However, since there are no established trading markets for a significant portion of First Guaranty's financial instruments, First\nGuaranty may not be able to immediately settle financial instruments; as such, the fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized through\nimmediate settlement. In addition, the majority of the financial instruments, such as loans and deposits, are held to maturity and are realized or paid according to the contractual\nagreement with the customer.\nQuoted market prices are used to estimate fair values when available. However, due to the nature of the financial instruments, in many instances quoted market prices are not\navailable. Accordingly, estimated fair values have been estimated based on other valuation techniques, such as discounting estimated future cash flows using a rate\ncommensurate with the risks involved or other acceptable methods. Fair values are estimated without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of\nownership of financial instruments, possible income tax ramifications or estimated transaction costs. The fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve matters of\nsignificant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Fair values are also estimated at a specific point in time and are based on interest rates and other\nassumptions at that date. As events change the assumptions underlying these estimates, the fair values of financial instruments will change.\nDisclosure of fair values is not required for certain items such as lease financing, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, obligations of pension and\nother postretirement benefits, premises and equipment, other real estate, prepaid expenses, the value of long-term relationships with depositors (core deposit intangibles) and\nother customer relationships, other intangible assets and income tax assets and liabilities. Fair value estimates are presented for existing on- and off-balance sheet financial\ninstruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition,\nthe tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses have not been considered in the estimates. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts\npresented do not purport to represent and should not be considered representative of the underlying market or franchise value of First Guaranty.\nBecause the standard permits many alternative calculation techniques and because numerous assumptions have been used to estimate the fair values, reasonable comparison of\nthe fair value information with other financial institutions' fair value information cannot necessarily be made. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of\nfinancial instruments are as follows:\nCash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold and federal funds purchased.\nThese items are generally short-term and the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets are a reasonable estimation of the fair values.\nInvestment Securities.\nFair values are principally based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or\nthe use of discounted cash flow analyses.\nLoans Held for Sale.\nFair values of mortgage loans held for sale are based on commitments on hand from investors or prevailing market prices. These loans are classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nLoans, net.\nMarket values are computed present values using net present value formulas. The present value is the sum of the present value of all projected cash flows on an item at a\nspecified discount rate. The discount rate is set as an appropriate rate index, plus or minus an appropriate spread. These loans are classified within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy.\nLoan individually evaluated for impairment.\nFair value is measured by either the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent (Level 2 or Level 3), or the present value of expected future cash flows,\ndiscounted at the loan's effective interest rate (Level 3). Fair value of the collateral is determined by appraisals or by independent valuation.\nCash Surrender of BOLI.\nThe cash surrender value of BOLI approximates fair value.\nAccrued interest receivable.\nThe carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value.\nDeposits.\n-29-\nThe fair value of customer deposits, excluding certificates of deposit, is the amount payable on demand. Market values of certificates of deposit are actually computed present\nvalues using net present value formulas. The present value is the sum of the present value of all projected cash flows on an item at a specified discount rate. The discount rate is\nset as an appropriate rate index, plus or minus an appropriate spread. Deposits are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAccrued interest payable.\nThe carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value.\nBorrowings.\nThe carrying amount of federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings approximate their fair values. The fair value of First Guaranty's long-term borrowings is\ncomputed using net present value formulas. The present value is the sum of the present value of all projected cash flows on an item at a specified discount rate. The discount rate\nis set as an appropriate rate index, plus or minus an appropriate spread. Borrowings are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOther Unrecognized Financial Instruments.\nThe fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar legally binding agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of\nthe agreements and customers' credit ratings. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed\nrates. The fair values of letters of credit are based on fees charged for similar agreements or on estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the\ncounterparties at the reporting date. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of guarantees under commercial and standby letters of credit was not material.\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments at September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024 Using\n(in thousands) Carrying Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash and due from banks $ 362,855 $ 362,855 $ — $ — $ 362,855\nFederal funds sold 4,766 4,766 — — 4,766\nSecurities, available for sale 342,598 255,231 77,328 10,039 342,598\nSecurities, held for maturity 321,428 — 265,540 — 265,540\nLoans held for sale — — — — —\nLoans, net 2,736,370 — — 2,612,913 2,612,913\nCash surrender value of BOLI 5,973 — — 5,973 5,973\nAccrued interest receivable 17,660 — — 17,660 17,660\nLiabilities\nDeposits $ 3,429,925 $ — $ — $ 3,439,377 3,439,377\nShort-term advances from Federal Home Loan Bank — — —\nShort-term borrowings — — — — —\nRepurchase agreements 6,981 — — 7,031 7,031\nAccrued interest payable 17,750 — — 17,750 17,750\nLong-term advances from Federal Home Loan Bank 135,000 — — 137,374 137,374\nSenior long-term debt 16,163 — — 16,281 16,281\nJunior subordinated debentures 44,730 — — 44,730 44,730\n-30-\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments at December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Using\n(in thousands) Carrying Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash and due from banks $ 286,114 $ 286,114 $ — $ — $ 286,114\nFederal funds sold 341 341 — — 341\nSecurities, available for sale 83,485 49,830 23,172 10,483 83,485\nSecurities, held for maturity 320,638 — 253,584 — 253,584\nLoans, net 2,717,782 — — 2,581,979 2,581,979\nCash surrender value of BOLI 5,861 — — 5,861 5,861\nAccrued interest receivable 15,713 — — 15,713 15,713\nLiabilities\nDeposits $ 3,009,094 $ — $ — $ 3,001,498 3,001,498\nShort-term advances from Federal Home Loan Bank 50,000 — — 50,000 50,000\nShort-term borrowings 10,000 — — 10,000 10,000\nRepurchase agreements 6,297 — — 6,285 6,285\nAccrued interest payable 11,807 — — 11,807 11,807\nLong-term advances from Federal Home Loan Bank 155,000 — — 152,299 152,299\nSenior long-term debt 39,099 — — 39,304 39,304\nJunior subordinated debentures 15,000 — — 15,000 15,000\nThere is no material difference between the contract amount and the estimated fair value of off-balance sheet items that are primarily comprised of short-term unfunded loan\ncommitments that are generally at market prices.\n-31-\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of First Guaranty's financial condition and results of operations is intended to highlight the significant factors affecting First Guaranty's financial\ncondition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. This discussion is designed to provide readers with a more\ncomprehensive view of the operating results and financial position than would be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone.

Net income for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $11.4 million and $7.9 million, respectively, an increase of $3.5 million or 44.5%.\n• Earnings per common share were $0.11 and $0.10 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $0.78 and $0.56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Total weighted average shares outstanding were 12,504,717 and 11,431,083 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 12,499,799 and\n11,022,919 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in shares was due to the issuance of 44,341 and 29,293 shares of common\nstock under the Equity Bonus Plan during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, respectively, and the issuance of 1,714,287 shares of common stock under\nprivate placement in 2023.\n• The allowance for credit losses was $33.3 million or 1.20% of total loans at September 30, 2024 compared to $30.9 million or 1.13% at December 31, 2023.\n• Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.7 million compared to $20.4 million for the same period in 2023.

The increase in total nonaccrual loans\nwas concentrated primarily in one commercial real estate relationship that totaled $37.0 million. This relationship is comprised of five loans secured by real estate located in\nthe Midwest. $13.9 million of this relationship was previously reported in 90 day plus but still accruing at December 31, 2023.\n-33-\n• Return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.21%, for each period. Return on average assets for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.42% and 0.33%, respectively.

Return on average common equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.87% and 4.06%, respectively. Return on average\nassets is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average assets. Return on average common equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average\ncommon equity.\n• Book value per common share was $17.86 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $17.36 as of December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to the recent issuance of\nnew shares and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). AOCI is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, including\nunrealized losses on available for sale securities at the time of transfer to held to maturity.\n• First Guaranty's Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.08 and $0.16 per common share in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. First Guaranty has paid 125\nconsecutive quarterly dividends as of September 30, 2024.\n• First Guaranty paid preferred stock dividends of $1.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023.\n• As previously announced, on June 28, 2024, the Bank consummated a sale-leaseback transaction relating to two stand-alone branches and a portion of the headquarters\nbuilding which also contains a branch (collectively, the “Properties”). The aggregate cash purchase price was $14.7 million. The sale-leaseback transaction resulted in a pre-\ntax gain of approximately $13.3 million, or $10.5 million after tax. Aggregate first full year of rent expense under the Lease Agreements will be approximately $1.3 million\npre-tax, or $1.0 million after tax.\n• First Guaranty is conducting a goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024, its annual testing date. In light of First Guaranty’s stock price performing under book value,\nand First Guaranty’s recent earnings results, it is possible that a goodwill impairment charge will be taken in the fourth quarter of 2024. First Guaranty's last goodwill\ntesting date was October 1, 2023. First Guaranty’s impairment testing will include an evaluation of the entity fair value, and other testing as considered necessary.\n-34-\nFinancial Condition\nChanges in Financial Condition from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024\nAssets\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024 were $3.9 billion, an increase of $371.2 million, or 10.4%, from December 31, 2023. Assets increased primarily due to increases in\ninvestment securities of $259.9 million, cash and cash equivalents of $81.2 million and net loans of $18.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.\nLoans\nNet loans increased $18.6 million, or 0.7%, to $2.7 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. Non-farm non-residential loan balances increased $119.7 million due\nto new originations. Multifamily loans increased $43.3 million primarily due to the conversion of existing construction loans to permanent financing and the origination of new\nloans. One-to-four family residential loans increased $27.0 million primarily due to new originations. Farmland loans increased $7.0 million primarily due to seasonal activity.\nAgricultural loans increased $6.5 million due to seasonal activity. Consumer and other loans decreased $8.8 million primarily due to paydowns. Commercial lease loan balances\ndecreased $36.9 million primarily due to paydowns. First Guaranty's commercial lease portfolio generally has higher yields than commercial real estate loans but shorter average\nlives. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $60.5 million primarily due to paydowns. Construction and land development loans decreased $76.3 million principally due to\nthe sale of guaranteed loans and the conversion of existing loans to permanent financing. First Guaranty had approximately 3.2% of funded and 1.8% of unfunded commitments\nin our loan portfolio to businesses engaged in support or service activities for oil and gas operations. First Guaranty's hotel and hospitality portfolio totaled $182.2 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024. As part of the management of risks in our loan portfolio, First Guaranty had previously established an internal guidance limit of approximately $200.0\nmillion for its hotel and hospitality portfolio. First Guaranty had $409.0 million in loans related to our Texas markets at September 30, 2024 which was an increase of $33.4\nmillion or 8.9% from $375.7 million at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty anticipates additional growth opportunities in Texas. First Guaranty had $346.0 million in loans\nrelated to our new Mideast markets in Kentucky and West Virginia at September 30, 2024 compared to $278.1 million at December 31, 2023. Syndicated loans at September 30,\n2024 were $52.3 million, of which $27.9 million were shared national credits. Syndicated loans decreased $24.4 million from $76.7 million at December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 77.8% of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate. The largest portion of our loan portfolio, at 42.0% as of September 30, 2024, was non-farm\nnon-residential loans secured by real estate. Approximately 53.9% of the loan portfolio was based on a floating rate tied to the prime rate, Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\"SOFR\"), or Treasury rates as of September 30, 2024. 48.9% of the loan portfolio is scheduled to mature within five years from September 30, 2024.\nCommercial real estate (“CRE”) has received increased regulatory scrutiny in recent quarters due to valuation concerns associated with the increase in market interest rates and\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. First Guaranty has utilized enhanced risk management practices for CRE concentration analysis for several years. First Guaranty Bank’s\ncredit department conducts an annual stress test for CRE related loans that is presented to the Bank’s board of directors. The stress test analyzes the impact of changes in interest\nrates and cash flow on loan customers with credit exposures of $2.5 million or greater. First Guaranty generally requires personal guarantees on CRE loans. First Guaranty\ngenerally approves CRE loans with loan-to-values of 80% or less. First Guaranty also generally requires for construction related CRE loans that the borrower provides their\nequity contribution upfront before loan funds are advanced.\nFirst Guaranty has diversified its CRE portfolio across both industries and geographic location. The following is a summary of the largest CRE related loans associated with\nhotel and motels, office properties, apartment complexes, healthcare related properties, and properties under construction as of September 30, 2024. First Guaranty does not\nfinance standalone multi-story office buildings in major metropolitan areas. The largest CRE loan secured by a hotel or motel totaled $20.0 million. The property is a flagged\nhotel located in Texas. The largest CRE loan secured by an office related property totaled $21.4 million and is located in West Virginia. The largest CRE loan secured by an\napartment complex totaled $41.5 million secured by a property located in Louisiana. First Guaranty also holds a $26.0 million loan secured by an apartment complex that is\nlocated in Texas. The largest healthcare related loan is a $32.9 million property secured by an assisted living center located in Alabama. The largest CRE loan under construction\ntotaled $31.5 million for an apartment renovation project in Louisiana. First Guaranty also has a $29.6 million loan for land development secured by a property located in Texas.\nThe increase in classified assets at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was due to a $74.1 million increase in substandard loans offset by a $1.1 million\ndecrease in doubtful loans. The increase in substandard loans was primarily the result of downgrades during the second quarter of 2024 of two related commercial loan\nrelationships, with balances of $24.0 million and $18.2 million, from pass to substandard status, and one commercial loan relationship totaling $28.7 million downgraded during\nthe third quarter of 2024, from special mention to substandard status. The $28.7 million commercial loan relationship was pass status at December 31, 2023. The decrease in\ndoubtful loans was primarily the result of the payoff of a $0.4 million one-to-four family loan classified as doubtful during the first quarter of 2024. Special mention loans\nincreased by $60.5 million in 2024. The increase in special mention loans was primarily the result of downgrades during the third quarter of 2024 of one multifamily loan\ntotaling $26.0 million, one commercial lease loan relationship totaling $19.1 million, and one commercial real estate loan relationship totaling $8.6 million, from pass to special\nmention status.\nNet loans are reduced by the allowance for credit losses which totaled $33.3 million at September 30, 2024 and $30.9 million at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty adopted\nASC 326 effective January 1, 2023 and recorded a cumulative adjustment to the allowance of $7.0 million. Loan charge-offs were $13.7 million during the first nine months of\n2024 and $2.0 million during the same period in 2023. Recoveries totaled $0.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 and $1.2 million during the same period in 2023. The\nprovision for credit losses totaled $14.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 and $1.5 million for the same period in 2023. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for more information on loans and Note 5 for more information on the allowance for credit losses.\n-35-\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities at September 30, 2024 totaled $664.0 million, an increase of $259.9 million compared to $404.1 million at December 31, 2023. The portfolio consists of\nboth available for sale (AFS) and held to maturity securities (HTM). The securities designated as held to maturity are agency and corporate debt securities that are part of First\nGuaranty’s investment strategy and public funds collateralization program. We purchase securities for our investment portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an\nappropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk and meet pledging requirements for public funds and borrowings.\nThe securities portfolio consisted principally of U.S. Government and Government agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities and municipal\nbonds. U.S. government agencies consist of FHLB, Federal Farm Credit Bank (\"FFCB\"), Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae obligations. Mortgage-backed securities that we purchase\nare issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Management monitors the securities portfolio for both credit and interest rate risk. We generally limit the purchase of corporate\nsecurities to individual issuers to manage concentration and credit risk. Corporate securities generally have a maturity of 10 years or less. U.S. Government securities consist of\nU.S. Treasury securities that have maturities of less than two years. Government agency securities generally have maturities of 15 years or less. Agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities have stated final maturities of 15 to 20 years.\nOur available for sale securities portfolio totaled $342.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $259.1 million, or 310.4%, compared to $83.5 million at December 31,\n2023. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities.\nOur held to maturity securities portfolio totaled $321.4 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.8 million, or 0.2%, compared to $320.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, $256.3 million, or 38.6%, of the securities portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than one year. $13.3 million, or 2.0%, of the securities portfolio, not\nincluding collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities, were scheduled to mature between one and five years. The majority of these securities were\ncorporate bonds. $157.1 million, or 23.7%, of the securities portfolio, not including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities, were scheduled to\nmature between five and ten years. Securities, not including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities, with contractual maturity dates over 10 years\ntotaled $182.1 million, or 27.4%, of the total securities portfolio at September 30, 2024. The average maturity of the securities portfolio is affected by call options that may be\nexercised by the issuer of the securities and are influenced by market interest rates. Prepayments of mortgages that collateralize mortgage-backed securities also affect the\nmaturity of the securities portfolio. Based on internal forecasts as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the securities portfolio has a forecasted weighted average\nlife of approximately 6.32 years based on the current interest rate environment. The portfolio had an estimated effective duration of 4.74 years at September 30, 2024.\nThere were no credit related impairment of available for sale securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses for held to maturity\nsecurities was $0.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are\ncontractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Loans are ordinarily placed on nonaccrual status when principal and interest is delinquent for 90 days or\nmore. However, management may elect to continue the accrual when the asset is well secured and in the process of collection. It is our policy to discontinue the accrual of\ninterest income on any loan for which we have reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to\nincome is reversed. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the\npayment of principal or interest and a reasonable payment performance period is observed (generally considered six months or longer). Other real estate owned consists of\nproperty acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n-36-\nThe table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNonaccrual loans:\nReal Estate:\nConstruction and land development $ 2,815 $ 530\nFarmland 1,189 836\n1- 4 family 9,563 6,985\nMultifamily 537 537\nNon-farm non-residential 42,414 9,740\nTotal Real Estate 56,518 18,628\nNon-Real Estate:\nAgricultural 1,968 1,369\nCommercial and industrial 3,711 1,581\nCommercial leases 3,334 1,799\nConsumer and other 257 1,810\nTotal Non-Real Estate 9,270 6,559\nTotal nonaccrual loans 65,788 25,187\nLoans 90 days and greater delinquent & accruing:\nReal Estate:\nConstruction and land development — —\nFarmland — —\n1- 4 family 77 124\nMultifamily — —\nNon-farm non-residential — 14,711\nTotal Real Estate 77 14,835\nNon-Real Estate:\nAgricultural — 57\nCommercial and industrial — 395\nCommercial leases — —\nConsumer and other — —\nTotal Non-Real Estate — 452\nTotal loans 90 days and greater delinquent & accruing 77 15,287\nTotal nonperforming loans 65,865 40,474\nReal Estate Owned:\nConstruction and land development 203 251\nFarmland — —\n1- 4 family 267 309\nMultifamily — —\nNon-farm non-residential 690 690\nTotal Real Estate Owned 1,160 1,250\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 67,025 $ 41,724\nNonperforming assets to total loans 2.42 % 1.52 %\nNonperforming assets to total assets 1.71 % 1.17 %\nNonperforming loans to total loans 2.38 % 1.47 %\nNonaccrual loans to total loans 2.38 % 0.92 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 50.59 % 122.79 %\nNet loan charge-offs to average loans 0.62 % 0.17 %\n-37-\nAt September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets totaled $67.0 million, or 1.71% of total assets, compared to $41.7 million, or 1.17%, of total assets at December 31, 2023, which\nrepresented an increase of $25.3 million, or 60.6%. The increase in nonperforming assets occurred primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by a decrease\nin loans 90 days greater delinquent and still accruing and other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans included loans previously classified as purchase credit deteriorated\nfollowing the adoption of CECL.\nNonaccrual loans increased from $25.2 million at December 31, 2023 to $65.8 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in nonaccrual loans was concentrated primarily in\nnon-farm non-residential, one-to-four family, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, commercial leases, agricultural, and farmland loans. The largest\nincrease in nonaccrual loans was associated with one commercial real estate relationship totaling $37.0 million. Nonaccrual loans included $2.0 million in loans with a\ngovernment guarantee. These are structured as net loss guarantees in which up to 90% of loss exposure is covered.\nAt September 30, 2024, loans 90 days or greater delinquent and still accruing totaled $0.1 million, a decrease of $15.2 million compared to $15.3 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe decrease in loans 90 days or greater delinquent and still accruing was attributed to moving those loans to nonaccrual, and was concentrated primarily in non-farm non-\nresidential, commercial and industrial, agricultural, and one-to-four family loans.\nOther real estate owned totaled $1.2 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, our largest nonperforming assets were comprised of the following nonaccrual loans: (1) a $37.0 million non-farm non-residential loan relationship\ncomprised of five loans with a specific reserve of $4.1 million; (2) a $3.3 million one- to four-family loan relationship; (3) a $1.8 million commercial real estate loan; (4) a\ncommercial lease loan that totaled $1.7 million; (5) a commercial lease loan that totaled $1.6 million; (6) a $1.3 million one- to four-family loan relationship with a specific\nreserve of $0.5 million; and (7) a $1.3 million loan relationship that is classified as purchased credit deteriorated.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on November 12, 2024, First Guaranty placed a substandard commercial real estate loan relationship that totaled $28.7 million on nonaccrual status.\nFirst Guaranty also placed a special mention multifamily credit that totaled $26.0 million on nonaccrual status. A specific reserve has not been established on either credit at this\ntime.\n-38-\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nFirst Guaranty adopted FASB ASC Topic 326 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” Update No. 2016-13 (“ASU\n2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. ASU 2016-13, referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) standard, requires financial assets measured on an\namortized cost basis, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to be presented at an amount net of an allowance for credit losses, which reflects expected losses for\nthe full life of the financial asset. Unfunded lending commitments are also within the scope of this topic. Under prior GAAP losses were not recognized until the occurrence of\nthe loss was probable.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is maintained to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, offset by\nrecoveries of previously charged-off loans and is decreased by loan charge-offs. The provision is a charge to current expense to provide for current expected loan losses and to\nmaintain the allowance commensurate with management's evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Various factors are taken into consideration when determining the\namount of the provision and the adequacy of the allowance. These factors include but are not limited to:\n• past due and nonperforming assets;\n• specific internal analysis of loans requiring special attention;\n• the current level of regulatory classified and criticized assets and the associated risk factors with each;\n• changes in underwriting standards or lending procedures and policies;\n• charge-off and recovery practices;\n• national and local economic and business conditions;\n• nature and volume of loans;\n• overall portfolio quality;\n• adequacy of loan collateral;\n• quality of loan review system and degree of oversight by our board of directors;\n• competition and legal and regulatory requirements on borrowers;\n• examinations of the loan portfolio by federal and state regulatory agencies and examinations; and\n• review by our internal loan review department and independent accountants.\nThe data collected from all sources in determining the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management with regard to current national and local\neconomic trends, prior loss history, underlying collateral values, credit concentrations and industry risks. An estimate of potential loss on specific loans is developed in\nconjunction with an overall risk evaluation of the total loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as\nnew information becomes available.\nThe allowance consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful, substandard, or collateral\ndependent. For such loans that are also classified as collateral dependent, an allowance is established when the collateral value is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The\ngeneral component covers non-classified loans and special mention loans and is based on historical loss experience for the past three years adjusted for qualitative factors\ndescribed above. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect the estimate of probable losses.\nThe balance in the allowance for credit losses is principally influenced by the provision for loan losses, recoveries, and by net loan loss experience. Additions to the allowance\nare charged to the provision for credit losses. Losses are charged to the allowance as incurred and recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the\nallowance at the time recovery is collected.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans was $33.3 million, or 1.20% of total loans, and 50.5% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024.\nComparing September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023, there were changes within the specific components of the allowance balance.\nA provision for credit losses of $14.0 million was made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The $14.0 million\nprovision made in 2024 included a $1.3 million negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. First Guaranty's unfunded commitments declined during\nthe first nine months of 2024 which resulted in a reduced liability. The provisions made were taken to provide for current credit losses and to maintain the allowance\nproportionate to risks inherent in the loan portfolio.\n-39-\nThe loan portfolio factors in the first nine months of 2024 that primarily affected the allocation of the allowance included the following:\n• Construction and land development loans decreased during the first nine months of 2024 due to loans converted to permanent financing. The allowance decrease\nrelated to this portfolio was due to a decline in the portfolio along with changes in the qualitative analysis of the portfolio related to economic conditions.\n• One-to-four family residential loans increased $27.0 million during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance increase related to this portfolio was due to growth in\nthe portfolio.\n• Multifamily loans increased during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance decrease related to this portfolio was due to changes in the qualitative analysis of the\nportfolio.\n• Non-farm non-residential loans increased by $119.7 million during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance increase related to this portfolio was due to growth,\ncharge-offs and changes in the qualitative analysis of the portfolio related to economic conditions.\n• Commercial and industrial loans decreased during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance decrease related to this portfolio was due to charge-offs and changes in\nthe qualitative analysis of the portfolio.\n• Commercial leases decreased during the first nine months of 2024 from $285.4 million at December 31, 2023 to $248.6 million at September 30, 2024. The allowance\nincrease related to this portfolio was due changes in the qualitative analysis of the portfolio.\n• Consumer and other loans decreased during the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the related loan loss allowance balance was due primarily to charge-offs and\nqualitative analysis of the portfolio.\nFirst Guaranty charged off $13.7 million in loan balances during the first nine months of 2024. The details of the $13.7 million in charged-off loans were as follows:\n1. First Guaranty charged off $2.8 million in consumer loans during the first nine months of 2024. The consumer loan charge offs included $0.1 million in credit card\nloans, $1.2 million of loans secured by automobiles or equipment and $1.5 million in unsecured loans.\n2. First Guaranty charged off $0.2 million on a commercial and industrial SBA loan relationship during the first quarter of 2024. This relationship had no remaining\nprincipal balance at September 30, 2024.\n3. First Guaranty charged off $3.8 million on a loan relationship associated with a restaurant supply business located in Louisiana during the second quarter of 2024. This\nloan was secured by real estate, equipment, and inventory. This loan had a previous specific reserve of $2.5 million as of March 31, 2024. This loan had no remaining\nprincipal balance at September 30, 2024.\n4. First Guaranty charged off a $1.8 million commercial and industrial loan that was originated under the Main Street Lending Program during the second quarter of\n2024. The $1.8 million was the unguaranteed retained portion of the loan. This loan had a previous allocation in the reserve of $1.8 million at March 31, 2024. This\nloan had no remaining principal balance at September 30, 2024.\n5. First Guaranty charged off $0.6 million on a real estate secured loan located in Louisiana during the second quarter of 2024. This was an acquired loan from the Union\nBank acquisition and was secured by rental properties. This loan had a remaining principal balance of $0.4 million at September 30, 2024.\n6. First Guaranty charged off $0.4 million on a commercial and industrial SBA loan relationship during the second quarter of 2024. This relationship had a remaining\nprincipal balance of $0.6 million at September 30, 2024.\n7. First Guaranty charged off $0.3 million on a real estate secured SBA loan during the second quarter of 2024. This loan had a remaining principal balance of $0.9\nmillion at September 30, 2024.\n8. First Guaranty charged off $1.0 million on a loan relationship that is classified as purchased credit deteriorated during the third quarter of 2024. This relationship had\nremaining principal balance of $1.3 million at September 30, 2024.\n9. Smaller loans and overdrawn deposit accounts comprised the remaining $2.8 million of charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024.\n-40-\nOther information related to the allowance for credit losses is as follows:\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nLoans:\nAverage outstanding balance $ 2,793,397 $ 2,576,793\nBalance at end of period $ 2,769,651 $ 2,699,393\nAllowance for Credit Losses:\nBalance at beginning of year $ 30,926 $ 23,518\nAdoption of ASC 326 — 8,120\nCharge-offs (13,674) (2,045)\nRecoveries 716 1,165\nProvision 15,313 1,178\nBalance at end of period $ 33,281 $ 31,936\nDeposits\nManaging the mix and pricing the maturities of deposit liabilities is an important factor affecting our ability to maximize our net interest margin. The strategies used to manage\ninterest-bearing deposit liabilities are designed to adjust as the interest rate environment changes. We regularly assess our funding needs, deposit pricing and interest rate\noutlooks. From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, total deposits increased $420.8 million, or 14.0%, to $3.4 billion. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\ndecreased $40.8 million, or 9.2%, to $402.0 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was primarily concentrated in individual and\nbusiness noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $24.7 million, or 1.6%, to $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. The decrease in\ninterest-bearing demand deposits was primarily concentrated in public funds interest-bearing demand deposits. Savings deposits increased $14.5 million, or 6.6%, to $233.5\nmillion at September 30, 2024, primarily related to increases in business and individual savings deposits. Time deposits increased $471.8 million, or 57.5%, to $1.3\nbillion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases in brokered time deposits.\nManagement will continue to evaluate and update our product mix and related technology in its efforts to attract additional customers. We currently offer a number of deposit\nproducts that are competitively priced and designed to attract and retain customers with primary emphasis on noninterest-bearing deposits, select time deposits and other lower\ncost deposits.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of outstanding certificates of deposit in amounts greater than $250,000 was approximately $197.1 million. At September 30,\n2024, approximately $39.0 million of First Guaranty's certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 had a remaining term greater than one year.\nThe total amount of our uninsured deposits (deposits in excess of $250,000, as calculated in accordance with FDIC regulations) was estimated at $273.1 million at September 30,\n2024. This total excludes public funds deposits that are collateralized by securities or FHLB letters of credit. The amount of uninsured deposits including collateralized public\nfunds deposits was estimated at $847.6 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of our time deposit accounts.\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024\nTime deposits of less than $100,000 $ 743,502\nTime deposits of $100,000 through $250,000 351,911\nTime deposits of more than $250,000 197,149\nTotal Time Deposits $ 1,292,562\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of the time deposits greater than $250,000 at September 30, 2024.\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024\nThree months or less $ 51,480\nThree to six months 55,415\nSix months to one year 51,260\nOne to three years 26,168\nMore than three years 12,826\nTotal Time Deposits greater than $250,000 $ 197,149\n-41-\nPublic funds deposits totaled $1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Public funds time deposits totaled $73.0 million at September 30,\n2024 compared to $50.9 million at December 31, 2023. Public funds deposits increased due to new balances from existing customers that was primarily attributed to seasonal\nfluctuations. First Guaranty has developed a program for the retention and management of public funds deposits. Since the end of 2012, First Guaranty has maintained public\nfunds deposits in excess of $400.0 million. These deposits are from public entities such as school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and municipalities. The majority\nof these funds are under fiscal agency agreements with terms of three years or less. Deposits under fiscal agency agreements are generally stable but public entities may maintain\nthe ability to negotiate term deposits on a specific basis including with other financial institutions. These deposits generally have stable balances as we maintain both operating\naccounts and time deposits for these entities. There is a seasonal component to public deposit levels associated with annual tax collections. Public funds will increase at the end\nof the year and during the first quarter. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, there are monthly fluctuations associated with internal payroll and short-term tax collection accounts\nfor our public funds deposit accounts. Public funds deposit accounts are collateralized by FHLB letters of credit, by expanded reciprocal deposit insurance programs, by\nLouisiana municipal bonds and by eligible government and government agency securities such as those issued by the FHLB, FFCB, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. First\nGuaranty continues to grow the proportion of its public funds portfolio that is collateralized by reciprocal deposit insurance as an alternative to pledging securities or utilizing\nFHLB letters of credit. First Guaranty initiated this strategy to invest these deposits more efficiently in higher yielding loans to improve the net interest margin and earnings.\nTotal public funds collateralized by reciprocal deposit insurance programs decreased to $526.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $591.7 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth public funds as a percent of total deposits.\n(in thousands except for %) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPublic Funds:\nNoninterest-bearing Demand $ 6,696 $ 6,471\nInterest-bearing Demand 992,946 1,090,527\nSavings 47,544 46,606\nTime 72,992 50,934\nTotal Public Funds $ 1,120,178 $ 1,194,538\nTotal Deposits $ 3,429,925 $ 3,009,094\nTotal Public Funds as a percent of Total Deposits 32.7 % 39.7 %\nBorrowings\nFirst Guaranty maintains borrowing relationships with other financial institutions as well as the Federal Home Loan Bank on a short and long-term basis to meet liquidity needs.\nFirst Guaranty had $7.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared to $66.3 million at December 31, 2023. The short-term borrowings at\nSeptember 30, 2024 were comprised of repurchase agreements of $7.0 million. The short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023 were comprised of short-term\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances of $50.0 million, a line of credit of $20.0 million with an outstanding balance of $10.0 million and repurchase agreements of $6.3 million.

During 2023, First\nGuaranty converted previous short-term floating rate borrowings from the FHLB into long-term lower fixed rate borrowings in order to reduce interest expense. First Guaranty\nhas a $100.0 million FHLB advance that matures in the second quarter of 2027 and a $35.0 million FHLB advance that matures in the third quarter of 2027.\nFirst Guaranty had senior long-term debt totaling $16.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and $39.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nFirst Guaranty had subordinated debt totaling $44.7 million at September 30, 2024 and $15.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the issuance in March of\n2024 of $30.0 million of new subordinated debt.\nFirst Guaranty had $507.5 million in Federal Home Loan Bank letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 compared to $513.3 million at December 31, 2023.

The increase in shareholders' equity was principally the\nresult of an increase of $4.7 million in retained earnings, $0.3 million in surplus and a decrease of $1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The $4.7\nmillion increase in retained earnings was primarily due to net income of $11.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by $5.0 million in cash\ndividends paid on shares of our common stock and $1.7 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our preferred stock. The $0.3 million increase in surplus was due to common\nstock issued under the Equity Bonus Plan during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily attributed to the decrease in\nunrealized losses on available for sale securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n-42-\nResults of Operations for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nPerformance Summary\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.9 million,\nan increase of $0.2 million, or 8.7%, from $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared to the prior year period was the result of several factors. First Guaranty experienced an increase in interest income, an increase in noninterest income, and a\ndecrease in noninterest expense. This increased income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan losses. Loan interest\nincome increased due to the growth in First Guaranty's loan portfolio, repricing of existing loans to higher market rates, including loan fees recognized as an adjustment to yield.\nSecurities interest income increased due to an increase in the average yield of the investment portfolio. Noninterest income increased primarily due to an increase on gains on the\nsale of loans. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to decreased personnel expenses, legal and professional fees, travel and lodging, operating supplies, and marketing\nexpense. Factors that offset the increase in net income included an increase in interest expense that was due to increases in volume of interest-bearing liabilities and market\ninterest rates. The increase in the provision was related to changes within the portfolio and charge-offs experienced in the third quarter. Earnings per common share for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was $0.11 per common share, an increase of 10.0% or $0.01 per common share from $0.10 per common share for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $11.4 million,\nan increase of $3.5 million, or 44.5%, from $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared to the prior year period was the result of several factors. First Guaranty experienced an increase in interest income, an increase in noninterest income, and a\ndecrease in noninterest expense. This increased income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan losses. Loan interest\nincome increased due to the growth in First Guaranty's loan portfolio and repricing of existing loans to higher market rates, including loan fees recognized as an adjustment to\nyield. Securities interest income increased due to an increase in the average yield of the investment portfolio. Noninterest income increased primarily due to the net gain on sale\nof assets related to the sale-leaseback transaction and an increase on gains on the sale of loans. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to decreased legal and professional\nfees, marketing, travel and lodging, operating supplies, and data processing. Factors that partially offset the increase in net income included an increase in interest expense that\nwas due to increases in volume of interest-bearing liabilities and market interest rates. The increase in the provision was related to changes within the portfolio and charge-offs\nexperienced in 2024. Earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.78 per common share, an increase of 39.3% or $0.22 per common share\nfrom $0.56 per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n-43-\nNet Interest Income\nOur operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, including loans and\nsecurities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. Interest rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the amount\nand type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, combine to affect net interest income. First Guaranty’s assets and liabilities are generally most affected by\nchanges in the Federal Funds rate, SOFR rate, short term Treasury rates such as one month and three month Treasury bills, and longer term Treasury rates such as the U.S. ten\nyear Treasury rate. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. There may also be a time lag in\nthe effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities. It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and\nother borrowed funds.\nA financial institution's asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non-financial company, in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.\nAccordingly, changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on a financial institution's performance. The impact of interest rate changes depends on the sensitivity to the\nchange of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The effects of the changing interest rate environment in recent periods and our interest sensitivity position is\ndiscussed below.\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwas $22.7 million and $20.4 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was\nprimarily due to an increase in the average balance of our total interest-earning assets and an increase in the average yield of our total interest-earning assets, partially offset by\nan increase in the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the average rate of our total interest-bearing liabilities. For the three months\nended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our total interest-earning assets increased by $412.3 million to $3.6 billion due to strong growth in our loan portfolio, and an\nincrease in interest-earning deposits with banks. The average yield of our interest-earning assets increased by 42 basis points to 6.34% for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 from 5.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an improved mix of higher yielding assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average\nbalance of our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by $466.8 million to $3.0 billion primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. The average rate\nof our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 35 basis points to 4.54% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.19% for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The rise in market interest rates, particularly associated with Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in our liabilities cost. The primary source of\nthe increase in liabilities cost was associated with the repricing of maturing time deposits to higher market rates along with interest bearing demand deposits for public funds that\nare primarily indexed to Treasury rates. As a result, our net interest rate spread increased 7 basis points to 1.80% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.73% for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 3 basis points to 2.51% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.54% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwas $65.9 million and $63.7 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was\nprimarily due to an increase in the average balance of our total interest-earning assets and an increase in the average yield of our total interest-earning assets, partially offset by\nan increase in the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the average rate of our total interest-bearing liabilities. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our total interest-earning assets increased by $394.3 million to $3.5 billion due to strong growth in our loan portfolio and an\nincrease in interest-earning deposits with banks. The average yield of our interest-earning assets increased by 55 basis points to 6.28% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 from 5.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an improved mix of higher yielding assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average\nbalance of our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by $461.2 million to $2.9 billion primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. The average rate\nof our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 74 basis points to 4.49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.75% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The rise in market interest rates, particularly associated with Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in our liabilities cost. The primary source of the increase in\nliabilities cost was associated with the repricing of maturing time deposits to higher market rates along with interest bearing demand deposits for public funds that are primarily\nindexed to Treasury rates. As a result, our net interest rate spread decreased 19 basis points to 1.79% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.98% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 23 basis points to 2.52% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.75% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\n-44-\nInterest Income\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased $9.8 million, or 20.6%, to $57.4 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. First Guaranty's loan portfolio expanded during the third quarter of 2024 due to growth associated\nwith our loan originations and existing loans repriced to higher market rates. These factors contributed to the increase in interest income as the average balance of our total\ninterest-earning assets, primarily associated with loans, increased, and the average yield of interest-earning assets increased. The average balance of our interest-earning assets\nincreased $412.3 million to $3.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The average yield of interest-earning\nassets increased by 42 basis points to 6.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest income on securities increased $0.6 million to $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of\nan increase in average balance and average yield of securities. The average balance of securities increased $12.5 million to $424.6 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 from $412.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a increase in the average balance of our U.S. Treasuries\nsecurities portfolio compared to the prior year. The average yield on securities increased 54 basis points to 2.78% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n2.24% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in lower yielding Treasury securities that matured in 2023.\nInterest income on loans increased $6.4 million or 14.8%, to $49.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of an\nincrease in the average balance and average yield of loans. The average balance of loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased by $178.7 million to $2.8 billion for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 from $2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely as a result of new loan originations. The average yield on loans\n(excluding loans held for sale) increased by 51 basis points to 7.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.54% for the three months ended September 30, 2023\ndue to the improved mix of loans along with an increase in market interest rates.\nInterest income on interest-earning deposits with banks increased $2.7 million to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year\nperiod as a result of an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $219.3\nmillion to $364.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $145.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased $31.3 million, or 23.6%, to $164.0 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. First Guaranty's loan portfolio expanded during the first nine months of 2024 due to growth\nassociated with our loan originations and existing loans repriced to higher market rates. These factors contributed to the increase in interest income as the average balance of our\ntotal interest-earning assets, primarily associated with loans, increased, and the average yield of interest-earning assets increased. The average balance of our interest-earning\nassets increased $394.3 million to $3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year. The average yield of interest-earning assets\nincreased by 55 basis points to 6.28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest income on securities increased $0.8 million to $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of an\nincrease in average yield of securities. The average yield on securities increased 39 basis points to 2.68% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.29% for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in lower yielding Treasury securities that matured in 2023. The average balance of securities decreased $19.4\nmillion to $396.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $415.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the\naverage balance of our U.S. Treasuries securities portfolio compared to the prior year.\nInterest income on loans increased $22.4 million or 18.4%, to $144.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of an\nincrease in the average balance and average yield of loans. The average balance of loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased by $216.6 million to $2.8 billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 from $2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 largely as a result of new loan originations. The average yield on loans\n(excluding loans held for sale) increased by 58 basis points to 6.90% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\ndue to the improved mix of loans along with an increase in market interest rates.\nInterest income on interest-earning deposits with banks increased $8.0 million to $11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year\nperiod as a result of an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $196.5\nmillion to $299.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $103.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n-45-\nInterest Expense\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased $7.5 million, or 27.8%, to $34.7 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 from $27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates and due to an\nincrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average rate of interest-bearing demand deposits was 4.50% for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 4.47% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in market interest rates, particularly U.S. Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in rates paid on\ninterest-bearing demand deposits. The largest concentration of interest-bearing demand deposits is associated with public funds deposits that are primarily indexed to Treasury\nrates. Treasury rates increased as the Federal Reserve increased rates to address increased inflation in the U.S. economy. The average rate of time deposits increased 105 basis\npoints during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.85% as compared to the prior year period. The increase in the average rate of time deposits was due to changes in\nmarket rates as existing time deposits repriced to higher market rates. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $466.8 million during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 to $3.0 billion as compared to the prior year period. This increase was a result of a $69.9 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing\ndemand deposits, a $18.0 million increase in the average balance of savings deposits, a $358.2 million increase in the average balance of time deposits, and a $20.6 million\nincrease in the average balance of borrowings.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased $29.1 million, or 42.1%, to $98.1 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 from $69.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates and due to an\nincrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average rate of interest-bearing demand deposits was 4.48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n4.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in market interest rates, particularly U.S. Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in rates paid on interest-\nbearing demand deposits. The largest concentration of interest-bearing demand deposits is associated with public funds deposits that are primarily indexed to Treasury rates.\nTreasury rates increased as the Federal Reserve increased rates to address increased inflation in the U.S. economy. The average rate of time deposits increased 144 basis points\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.72% as compared to the prior year period. The increase in the average rate of time deposits was due to changes in market\nrates as existing time deposits repriced to higher market rates. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $461.2 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 to $2.9 billion as compared to the prior year period. This increase was a result of a $61.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing\ndemand deposits, a $18.2 million increase in the average balance of savings deposits, a $300.7 million increase in the average balance of time deposits, and a $81.0 million\nincrease in the average balance of borrowings.\n-46-\nThe following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were\nmade, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have\nbeen reflected in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to\ninterest income or expense.\nThe net interest income yield shown below in the average balance sheet is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and is a measure of the\nefficiency of the earnings from balance sheet activities. It is affected by changes in the difference between interest on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and\nthe percentage of interest-earning assets funded by interest-bearing liabilities.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\n(in thousands except for %) Average Balance Interest Yield/Rate (5) Average Balance Interest Yield/Rate (5)\nAssets\nInterest-earning assets:\nInterest-earning deposits with banks $ 364,538 $ 4,645 5.07 % $ 145,235 $ 1,897 5.18 %\nSecurities (including FHLB stock) 424,620 2,971 2.78 % 412,169 2,323 2.24 %\nFederal funds sold 2,211 — — % 331 — — %\nLoans held for sale — — — % — — — %\nLoans, net of unearned income(6) 2,811,227 49,811 7.05 % 2,632,564 43,407 6.54 %\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,602,596 $ 57,427 6.34 % 3,190,299 $ 47,627 5.92 %\nNoninterest-earning assets:\nCash and due from banks 19,021 18,418\nPremises and equipment, net 68,974 62,348\nOther assets 35,860 27,420\nTotal Assets $ 3,726,451 $ 3,298,485\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits $ 1,499,327 $ 16,957 4.50 % $ 1,429,402 $ 16,102 4.47 %\nSavings deposits 234,118 1,374 2.33 % 216,089 1,001 1.84 %\nTime deposits 1,036,757 12,631 4.85 % 678,521 6,504 3.80 %\nBorrowings 271,954 3,767 5.51 % 251,317 3,575 5.64 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,042,156 $ 34,729 4.54 % 2,575,329 $ 27,182 4.19 %\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits 408,383 461,489\nOther 19,562 20,660\nTotal Liabilities 3,470,101 3,057,478\nShareholders' equity 256,350 241,007\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity $ 3,726,451 $ 3,298,485\nNet interest income $ 22,698 $ 20,445\nNet interest rate spread (1) 1.80 % 1.73 %\nNet interest-earning assets (2) $ 560,440 $ 614,970\nNet interest margin (3), (4) 2.51 % 2.54 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to interest-bearing\nliabilities 118.42 % 123.88 %\n(1) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.\n(2) Net interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(3) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n(4) The tax adjusted net interest margin was 2.51% and 2.55% for the above periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The\nprovision is based on management's regular evaluation of current economic conditions in our specific markets as well as regionally and nationally, changes in the character and\nsize of the loan portfolio, underlying collateral values securing loans, and other factors which deserve recognition in estimating loan losses. This evaluation is inherently\nsubjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was $4.9 million compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2023. The $4.9 million included\na $0.5 million negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. Total charge-offs were $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n$0.5 million for the same period in 2023. Charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were concentrated in consumer auto and equipment secured loans,\nunsecured consumer loans, consumer credit card loans, a loan relationship classified as purchased credit deteriorated, a commercial and industrial loan relationship, and a one- to\nfour-family loan. Partially offsetting these charge-offs were recoveries that totaled $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was $14.0 million compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The $14.0 million\nprovision included a $1.3 million negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. Total charge-offs were $13.7 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $2.0 million for the same period in 2023. Charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were concentrated in consumer auto and\nequipment secured loans, unsecured consumer loans, a loan relationship that is classified as purchased credit deteriorated a loan relationship associated with a restaurant supply\nbusiness located in Louisiana secured by real estate, equipment and inventory, and a commercial and industrial loan associated with the Main Street Lending Program. Partially\noffsetting these charge-offs were recoveries that totaled $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.2 million for the same period in 2023.\nWe believe that the allowance is adequate to cover current expected losses in the loan portfolio given the current economic conditions, and current expected net charge-offs and\nnonperforming asset levels. Economic uncertainty may result in additional increases to the allowance for credit losses in future periods.\nNoninterest Income\nOur primary sources of recurring noninterest income are customer service fees, ATM and debit card fees, loan fees, gains on the sales of loans and available for sale securities\nand other service fees. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest\nmethod.\nNoninterest income totaled $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.9 million from $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gains on the sale of loans. Service charges, commissions and fees totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $0.9 million for the same period in 2023. ATM and debit card fees totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net\nsecurities losses were $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net gains on the sale of loans were $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $0 for the same period in 2023. Net gains on the sale of assets were $31,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net losses of $7,000\nfor the same period in 2023. Other noninterest income totaled $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2023.\nNoninterest income totaled $22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $14.2 million from $8.0 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gains on sale of assets associated with the sale-leaseback transaction during the second quarter of 2024. Service\ncharges, commissions and fees totaled $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2023. ATM and debit card\nfees totaled $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2023. Net securities losses were $0 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net gains on the sale of loans were $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12,000 for the same period in\n2023. Net gains on the sale of assets were $13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $11,000 for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest\nincome totaled $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.1 million for the same period in 2023.\n-49-\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense and other types of expenses. Noninterest expense totaled $19.7 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and $20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits expense totaled $10.1 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and $10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled $2.5 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest expense totaled $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand $7.4 million for the same period in 2023.\nNoninterest expense totaled $59.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $59.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits\nexpense totaled $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled $7.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $6.5 million for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest expense totaled $21.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $23.0\nmillion for the same period in 2023.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of other noninterest expense:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOther noninterest expense:\nLegal and professional fees $ 625 $ 1,296 $ 3,102 $ 4,829\nData processing 413 497 1,196 1,559\nATM fees 424 448 1,237 1,271\nMarketing and public relations 296 463 999 1,472\nTaxes - sales, capital, and franchise 678 558 1,890 1,664\nOperating supplies 41 224 247 664\nSoftware expense and amortization 1,203 1,366 3,824 3,768\nTravel and lodging 112 330 599 1,118\nTelephone 135 96 378 264\nAmortization of core deposit intangibles 174 174 522 522\nDonations 58 148 241 574\nNet costs from other real estate and repossessions 150 124 533 243\nRegulatory assessment 1,182 676 3,105 2,112\nOther 1,579 1,046 3,582 2,930\nTotal other noninterest expense $ 7,070 $ 7,446 $ 21,455 $ 22,990\nIncome Taxes\nThe amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of other non-deductible expenses and the\nstatutory tax rate. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The provision for\nincome taxes increased due to an increase in income before income taxes. First Guaranty's statutory tax rate was 21.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023.\nThe provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes\nincreased due to an increase in income before income taxes. First Guaranty's statutory tax rate was 21.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n-50-\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to the ability or flexibility to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations. Maintaining appropriate levels of\nliquidity allows us to have sufficient funds available to meet customer demand for loans, withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities. Liquid\nassets include cash and due from banks, interest-earning demand deposits with banks, federal funds sold and available for sale investment securities.\nFirst Guaranty's cash and cash equivalents totaled $367.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $286.5 million at December 31, 2023. Loans maturing within one year or\nless at September 30, 2024 totaled $434.8 million compared to $357.7 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, time deposits maturing within one year or less\ntotaled $773.8 million compared to $503.7 million at December 31, 2023. Time deposits maturing after one year through three years totaled $386.0 million at September 30,\n2024 compared to $214.0 million at December 31, 2023. Time deposits maturing after three years totaled $132.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $103.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. First Guaranty's held to maturity (\"HTM\") securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 was $321.4 million, or 48.4% of the investment portfolio, compared to\n$320.6 million, or 79.3% at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty's available for sale (\"AFS\") securities portfolio was $342.6 million, or 51.6% of the investment portfolio as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $83.5 million, or 20.7% of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2023. The majority of the AFS portfolio was comprised of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, corporate debt securities, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\nFirst Guaranty maintained a net borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank totaling $477.2 million and $259.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively with $135.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared to $205.0 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. The advances\noutstanding at September 30, 2024 were comprised of long-term advances that totaled $135.0 million. The $100.0 million FHLB long-term advance matures in the second\nquarter of 2027 and the $35.0 million FHLB long-term advance matures in the third quarter of 2027. The advances outstanding at December 31, 2023 were comprised of three\nlong term advances totaling $155.0 million and two short-term advances that totaled $50.0 million. The change in borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank was\ndue to changes in the value that First Guaranty receives on pledged collateral and due to First Guaranty's usage of the line. First Guaranty has increasingly transitioned public\nfunds deposits into reciprocal deposit programs for collateralization as an alternative to FHLB letters of credit. We also maintain federal funds lines of credit at various\ncorrespondent banks with borrowing capacity of $100.5 million and one revolving line of credit totaling $20.0 million secured by a pledge of the Bank's common stock, with no\noutstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. We also have a discount window line with the Federal Reserve Bank that totaled $242.8 million at September 30, 2024 which was\nan increase of $23.7 million compared to availability of $219.1 million at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty did not have any advances under this facility at September 30,\n2024. Management believes there is sufficient liquidity to satisfy current operating needs.\nCapital Resources\nFirst Guaranty's capital position is reflected in shareholders' equity, subject to certain adjustments for regulatory purposes. Further, our capital base allows us to take advantage of\nbusiness opportunities while maintaining the level of resources we deem appropriate to address business risks inherent in daily operations.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased to $256.4 million at September 30, 2024 from $249.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity was principally the\nresult of an increase of $4.7 million in retained earnings, $0.3 million in surplus and a decrease of $1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The $4.7\nmillion increase in retained earnings was primarily due to net income of $11.4 million, partially offset by $5.0 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our common stock and\n$1.7 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The $0.3 million increase in surplus was due to common\nstock issued under the Equity Bonus Plan during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily attributed to the decrease in\nunrealized losses on available for sale securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n-51-\nRegulatory Capital\nRisk-based capital regulations adopted by the FDIC require banks to achieve and maintain specified ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. Similar capital regulations apply to\nbank holding companies over $3.0 billion in assets. The risk-based capital rules are designed to measure \"Tier 1\" capital (consisting of common equity, retained earnings and a\nlimited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities, net of goodwill and other intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income)\nand total capital in relation to the credit risk of both on- and off- balance sheet items. Under the guidelines, one of its risk weights is applied to the different on-balance sheet\nitems. Off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments, are also subject to risk weighting. Applicable bank holding companies and all banks must maintain a minimum total\ncapital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8.00%, at least half of which must be in the form of core or Tier 1 capital. These guidelines also specify that bank holding companies\nthat are experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels.\nIn order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, an institution must hold a capital\nconservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank's capital conservation buffer was 3.64% exceeding the minimum of\n2.50%. As of September 30, 2024, First Guaranty's capital conservation buffer was 2.79% exceeding the minimum of 2.50%.\nAs a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the Federal Reserve Board has amended its small bank holding company and savings and\nloan holding company policy statement to provide that holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that are (i) not engaged in significant nonbanking\nactivities, (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and (3) do not have a material amount of SEC-registered debt or equity securities, other than trust preferred\nsecurities, that contribute to an organization's complexity, are no longer subject to regulatory capital requirements, effective August 30, 2018. On January 1, 2024, First Guaranty\nceased being considered a \"small bank holding company\". Accordingly, both the Bank and First Guaranty are required to maintain specified ratios of capital to risk-weighted\nassets.\nIn addition, as a result of the legislation, the federal banking agencies have developed a \"Community Bank Leverage Ratio\" (the ratio of a bank's Tier 1 capital to average total\nconsolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A \"qualifying community bank\" that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with\nall other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered \"well capitalized\" under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking\nagencies may consider a financial institution's risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal\nbanking agencies set the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 8%\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio increased to 8.5% for the calendar year. Community\nbanks will have until January 1, 2022, before the Community Bank Leverage Ratio requirement will return to 9%. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new\ndefinition. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank did not elect to follow the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.\nAt September 30, 2024, we satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements and were well capitalized within the meaning of federal regulatory requirements.\n\"Well Capitalized Minimums\" As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio\nBank 5.00 % 8.32 % 8.94 %\nConsolidated 5.00 % 6.88 % N/A\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio\nBank 8.00 % 10.62 % 10.31 %\nConsolidated 8.00 % 8.79 % N/A\nTotal Risk-based Capital Ratio\nBank 10.00 % 11.64 % 11.20 %\nConsolidated 10.00 % 11.37 % N/A\nCommon Equity Tier One Capital Ratio\nBank 6.50 % 10.62 % 10.31 %\nConsolidated 6.50 % 7.65 % N/A\n-52-\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nAsset/Liability Management and Market Risk\nOur asset/liability management (ALM) process consists of quantifying, analyzing and controlling interest rate risk (IRR) to maintain reasonably stable net interest income levels\nunder various interest rate environments. The principal objective of ALM is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate\nrisk and to maintain adequate levels of liquidity.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, one of our most significant forms of market risk is interest rate risk, which is inherent in our\nlending and deposit-taking activities. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans secured by real estate and fixed rate securities in our investment portfolio, have longer maturities\nthan our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest\nincome to changes in market interest rates. The board of directors of First Guaranty Bank has established two committees, the management asset liability committee and the\nboard investment committee, to oversee the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy,\noperating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. The\nmanagement asset liability committee is comprised of senior officers of the Bank and meets as needed to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position. The\nboard ALCO investment committee is comprised of certain members of the board of directors of the Bank and meets monthly. The management asset liability committee\nprovides a monthly report to the board ALCO investment committee.\nThe need for interest sensitivity gap management is most critical in times of rapid changes in overall interest rates. We generally seek to limit our exposure to interest rate\nfluctuations by maintaining a relatively balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on a one-year time horizon and greater than one-year time horizon. Because of the\nsignificant impact on net interest margin from mismatches in repricing opportunities, we monitor the asset-liability mix periodically depending upon the management asset\nliability committee's assessment of current business conditions and the interest rate outlook. We maintain exposure to interest rate fluctuations within prudent levels using\nvarying investment strategies. These strategies include, but are not limited to, frequent internal modeling of asset and liability values and behavior due to changes in interest\nrates. We monitor cash flow forecasts closely and evaluate the impact of both prepayments and extension risk.\n-53-\nThe following interest sensitivity analysis is one measurement of interest rate risk. This analysis reflects the contractual maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities over\nvarious time periods. This analysis does not factor in prepayments or interest rate floors on loans which may significantly change the report. This table includes nonaccrual loans\nin their respective maturity periods. The gap indicates whether more assets or liabilities are subject to repricing over a given time period. The interest sensitivity analysis at\nSeptember 30, 2024 illustrated below reflects a liability-sensitive position with a negative cumulative gap on a one-year basis.\nThe interest spread and liability funding discussed below are directly related to changes in asset and liability mixes, volumes, maturities and repricing opportunities for interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-sensitive assets and liabilities are those which are subject to repricing in the near term, including both floating or adjustable\nrate instruments and instruments approaching maturity. The interest sensitivity gap is the difference between total interest-sensitive assets and total interest-sensitive liabilities.\nInterest rates on our various asset and liability categories do not respond uniformly to changing market conditions. Interest rate risk is the degree to which interest rate\nfluctuations in the marketplace can affect net interest income.\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest Sensitivity Within\nOver 3 Months\n(in thousands except for %) 3 Months Or Less thru 12 Months Total One Year Over One Year Total\nEarning Assets:\nLoans (including loans held for sale) $ 870,952 $ 423,241 $ 1,294,193 $ 1,475,458 $ 2,769,651\nSecurities (including FHLB stock) 118,595 147,224 265,819 407,699 673,518\nFederal Funds Sold 4,766 — 4,766 — 4,766\nOther earning assets 347,917 — 347,917 — 347,917\nTotal earning assets $ 1,342,230 $ 570,465 $ 1,912,695 $ 1,883,157 $ 3,795,852\nSource of Funds:\nInterest-bearing accounts:\nDemand deposits $ 1,501,886 $ — $ 1,501,886 $ — $ 1,501,886\nSavings deposits 233,496 — 233,496 — 233,496\nTime deposits 255,799 517,951 773,750 518,812 1,292,562\nShort-term borrowings — — — 6,869 6,869\nLong-term borrowings 16,163 — 16,163 135,000 151,163\nJunior subordinated debt 44,730 — 44,730 — 44,730\nNoninterest-bearing, net — — — 565,146 565,146\nTotal source of funds $ 2,052,074 $ 517,951 $ 2,570,025 $ 1,225,827 $ 3,795,852\nPeriod gap $ (709,844) $ 52,514 $ (657,330) $ 657,330\nCumulative gap $ (709,844) $ (657,330) $ (657,330) $ —\nCumulative gap as a percent of earning assets (18.7)% (17.3)% (17.3)%\n-54-\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), a Company's \"disclosure controls and procedures\" means controls and\nother procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. First Guaranty maintains such controls designed to ensure this\nmaterial information is communicated to Management, including the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecision regarding required disclosure.\nManagement, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this\nquarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by\nthis quarterly report are effective. There were no changes in First Guaranty's internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter in the period covered by this\nquarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, First Guaranty's internal control over financial reporting.\n-55-\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFirst Guaranty is subject to various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business. First Guaranty assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding\nlegal proceedings. Where it is probable that First Guaranty will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, First Guaranty records a liability in its\nconsolidated financial statements. First Guaranty does not record a loss if the loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss is not estimable. First Guaranty was a defendant in a\nlawsuit alleging overpayment on a loan related to a disputed interest rate. This lawsuit was settled in the first quarter of 2023 for $0.6 million. First Guaranty Bank is a defendant\nin a lawsuit alleging fault for a loss of funds by a customer related to fraud by a third party, with a possible loss range of $0.0 million to $1.5 million. The Bank denies the\nallegations and intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, which is in early stages, and no trial has been set. No accrued liability has been recorded related to this lawsuit.\nFirst Guaranty settled a case in the third quarter of 2021 for $1.1 million. A receivable for $0.9 million was recorded for recovery by a claim against First Guaranty's insurer.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, First Guaranty received $0.5 million of the $0.9 million receivable. The remaining $0.4 million was written off. In the opinion of\nmanagement, neither First Guaranty nor First Guaranty Bank is currently involved in such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that the resolution is\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on First Guaranty’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes\nin these ordinary claims or litigation against First Guaranty or First Guaranty Bank could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition,\nregardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management’s attention, and may materially and adversely affect the reputation of First Guaranty\nand First Guaranty Bank, even if resolved favorably.\nItem 1A.
