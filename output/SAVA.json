(NASDAQ: SAVA, “Cassava”, the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing a novel, investigational treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia, today announced that the topline results from the Phase 3 ReThink-ALZ study of simufilam in mild-to-moderate AD did not meet each of the pre-specified co-primary, secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints. The co-primary endpoints were the change in cognition and function from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period at week 52, assessed by the ADAS-COG12 and ADCS-ADL scales, comparing simufilam to placebo. Simufilam continued to demonstrate an overall favorable safety profile. The Company will hold a webcast today at 8 AM ET.\n\n“The results are disappointing for patients and their families who are living with this disease and physicians who have been looking for novel treatment options. We took careful measures to enroll patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Despite that, the loss of cognition in the placebo group was less pronounced than was previously reported in other placebo-controlled studies in AD. We are working to understand this better,” said **Rick Barry , President and Chief Executive Officer**. “A result like this has implications on our second Phase 3 trial, ReFocus-ALZ. We have made the difficult decision to discontinue ReFocus-ALZ, given the nature of today’s reported results. The complete 52-week dataset will be available from the study along with a large portion of 76-week data. We intend to report detailed analyses of both studies in the future. We will also be discontinuing the Open Label Extension study.”\n\n**Mr. Barry** continued, “We have a special gratitude for the patients and their families and caregivers who participated in our clinical program for AD. We are also immensely grateful to our employees, study investigators and site coordinators, as well as our other partners, for their commitment to this program. We hope the information we have gathered can ultimately be used to benefit ongoing research in AD.”\n\nThe table below provides a high-level summary of the co-primary endpoints data. Topline analysis of the mild and moderate sub-groups, likewise, did not demonstrate statistical significance at week 52.\n\n**Co-Primary Endpoint****Data*** | **Simufilam 100 mg BID****N= 403** | **Placebo BID****N=401** | **Delta** | **P-value**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Co-Primary Endpoints****LS means change from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period**  \nADAS-COG12 (SE) | 2.8 ( 0.36) | 3.2 ( 0.36) | -0.39 ( 0.50) | P=0.43  \nADCS-ADL (SE) | -3.3 ( 0.44) | -3.8 ( 0.44) | 0.51 ( 0.61) | P=0.40  \n*Based on the intent-to-treat populationBID = twice dailyADAS-COG12 = The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (a lower number represents less cognitive impairment)ADCS-ADL = Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living (a higher number represents less functional impairment)  \n  \nThe table below provides a high-level summary of the patient demographic and safety data.

Cassava is well-capitalized with approximately $149.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the third quarter of 2024.”\n\n**Webcast Info**  \n---  \n**Date:** |  Monday, November 25th  \n**Time:** |  8:00 a.m. Eastern Time  \n**Webcast:** |  <https://lifescievents.com/event/cassava/>  \n  \nA webcast of the live call will be available in the investor relations section of the Cassava website.

The trial randomized 804 people with confirmed mild or moderate AD, defined by several well validated parameters including a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) of >16 and <27, stratified as mild or moderate. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive simufilam 100 mg (n=403) or a matched placebo (n=401), dosed orally twice daily (BID) for 52 weeks.\n\nThe co-primary endpoints were the change in cognition and function from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period at week 52, assessed by the ADAS-COG12 and ADCS-ADL scales, comparing simufilam to placebo. Secondary endpoints also included several well validated measures of neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver burden. Safety was evaluated through multiple measures, including adverse event monitoring. The study also included a pharmacokinetic and plasma biomarker sub-study comprised of approximately 100 subjects, evaluated at three timepoints. ReThink-ALZ was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n**About Simufilam**\n\nSimufilam is a proprietary, investigational oral small molecule that targets the filamin A protein.\n\n**About Cassava Sciences, Inc.**\n\nCassava Sciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Austin, Texas.
