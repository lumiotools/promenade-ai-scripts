The results and comparisons presented below reflect continuing operations unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Highlights** _(Results from_ _Continuing_ _Operations; compared with prior year, where comparisons are noted)_\n\n  * Revenues of $171.8 million, down 15.3%, due primarily to a global softening in customer demand.\n  * Operating loss of $1.1 million, adjusted operating loss of $0.4 million, down compared to operating income and adjusted operating income of $8.9 million. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower sales volumes and operational inefficiencies.\n  * New business wins in the quarter of approximately $18 million when fully ramped, bringing the year-to-date total to $95 million; these wins were concentrated in our Electrical Systems segment, and include meaningful wins in our Vehicle Solutions segment.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share and adjusted net loss of $0.4 million, or $(0.01) per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million, down 64.8%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.5%, down from 6.0%.\n\n\n\nJames Ray, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Since taking over the CEO role eleven months ago, we have been tirelessly focused on reshaping the CVG operating model to create a more streamlined, lower cost, and customer-focused company. Our CVG team has been working diligently to divest non-strategic portfolio assets like Cab Structures and Industrial Automation, execute new program launches in Vehicle Solutions, initiate restructuring actions, pay down debt, and expand our global footprint in critical regions of Mexico and Morocco. Market conditions have made this transformation process even more difficult this year, as weaker customer demand and shifting production schedules have created operational and supply chain challenges. As a result of both market conditions and our portfolio actions, we have experienced incremental operational inefficiencies this year affecting our financial performance, especially during the third quarter. We are not happy with our performance and have taken significant steps to change the forward direction with expected performance improvement.”\n\nMr. Ray continued, “In addition to portfolio and restructuring actions, we’ve made senior management changes to drive growth in our Electrical Systems business and improve the efficiency of our supply chain and manufacturing operations while addressing structural costs and right sizing the company. This is an inflection point for CVG with many key actions completed this year. Despite softer end markets and slower new program ramps, we expect the actions we are taking today to help us reshape the company, driving incremental profitability with minimal added costs when customers’ demand improves. We believe this intense focus on operational excellence will make CVG more resilient and position us for margin expansion and growth with a commitment to value creation.”\n\nAndy Cheung, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Despite a challenging third quarter due to both external market conditions and internal operational issues, we successfully concluded multiple significant portfolio moves. The majority of proceeds from these actions were used to pay down debt. Executing these transactions led to short-term production inefficiencies that weighed on results during the quarter. We are currently addressing these operational issues to improve manufacturing capabilities and future competitiveness. With a more focused portfolio, we see potential to further streamline our enterprise cost structure. Ultimately, we expect these strategic actions will reposition our business for growth and margin expansion in 2025 and beyond.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results from Continuing Operations** _(amounts in millions except per share data and percentages)_\n\n**Third****Quarter**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nRevenues| $| 171.8| $| 202.9| $| (31.1)| (15.3)%  \nGross profit| $| 16.4| $| 29.3| $| (12.9)| (44.0)%  \nGross margin| 9.5%| 14.4%  \nAdjusted gross profit 1| $| 19.9| $| 29.4| $| (9.5)| (32.3)%  \nAdjusted gross margin 1| 11.6%| 14.5%  \nOperating income (loss)| $| (1.1)| $| 8.9| $| (10.0)| NM2  \nOperating margin| (0.6)%| 4.4%  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) 1| $| (0.4)| $| 8.9| $| (9.3)| NM2  \nAdjusted operating margin 1| (0.2)%| 4.4%  \nNet income (loss)| $| (0.9)| $| 4.7| $| (5.6)| NM2  \nAdjusted net income (loss) 1| $| (0.4)| $| 4.7| $| (5.1)| NM2  \nEarnings (loss) per share, diluted| $| (0.03)| $| 0.14| $| (0.17)| NM2  \nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share, diluted 1| $| (0.01)| $| 0.14| $| (0.15)| NM2  \nAdjusted EBITDA 1| $| 4.3| $| 12.2| $| (7.9)| (64.8)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin 1| 2.5%| 6.0%  \n1 See Appendix A for GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation  \n2 Not meaningful  \n  \n**Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations**\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 revenues were $171.8 million, compared to $202.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 15.3%. The overall decrease in revenues was due to lower sales as a result of a softening in customer demand in our Vehicle Solutions and Electrical Systems segments.\n  * Operating loss in the third quarter 2024 was $1.1 million compared to operating income of $8.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was attributable to the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, operational inefficiencies and increased restructuring charges. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating loss was $0.4 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $8.9 million in the prior year period.\n  * Interest associated with debt and other expenses was $2.4 million and $2.5 million for the third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations was $0.9 million, or $(0.03) per share, for the third quarter 2024 compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Third quarter 2024 adjusted net loss was $0.4 million, or $(0.01) per share, compared to adjusted net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.\n\n\n\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company had $14.0 million of outstanding borrowings on its U.S. revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings on its China credit facility, $30.9 million of cash and $146.3 million of availability from the credit facilities, resulting in total liquidity of $177.2 million.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Segment Results**\n\n**_Vehicle Solutions Segment_**\n\n  * Revenues were $97.3 million compared to $115.2 million for the prior year period, a decrease of 15.6%, due to lower sales volume as a result of decreased customer demand and the wind-down of certain programs.\n  * Operating income was $5.1 million, compared to $8.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 37.9%, primarily attributable to lower customer demand, operational remediation investments, and increased freight costs, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses due to the gain on the sale of a building of $3.5 million. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating income was $3.8 million compared to $8.3 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**_Electrical Systems Segment_**\n\n  * Revenues were $43.4 million compared to $53.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 19.5%, primarily due to a global softening in the Construction & Agriculture end-markets and the phase out of certain lower margin business.\n  * Operating loss was $0.4 million compared to operating income of $5.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 106.6%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, restructuring activities, and unfavorable foreign exchange. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating income was $0.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**_Aftermarket & Accessories Segment_**\n\n  * Revenues were $31.1 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 8.0%, primarily as a result of lower sales volume due to a reduction of backlog in the prior period as well as decreased customer demand.\n  * Operating income was $3.1 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 27.0%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, operational inefficiencies and restructuring activities. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating income was $3.9 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nCVG issued the following outlook for the full year 2024 which reflects both market developments and strategic portfolio actions undertaken:\n\n**Metric**| **Prior 2024 Outlook****(1)**| **Revised 2024 Outlook****(1)**  \n---|---|---  \nNet Sales| $730- $780| $710 - $740  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $28 - $36| $20 - $25  \n  \n(1) This outlook excludes any contribution from CVG’s Cab Structures or Industrial Automation businesses in 2024. On October 1, 2024, CVG closed the previously announced sale of the Cab Structures business, and received the final installment of the purchase price. Separately, CVG closed the sale of the Industrial Automation business on October 30, 2024.\n\nThis outlook reflects, among others, current industry forecasts for North America Class 8 truck builds.

In general, the non-GAAP measures exclude items that (i) management believes reflect the Company’s multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company’s performance, engage in financial and operational planning and to determine incentive compensation.\n\nManagement provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on the Company’s financial and operating results and in comparing the Company’s performance to that of its competitors and to comparable reporting periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NzE3NyM2NTYzODkyIzIwMDc4OTQ=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzJkMDlkNzItNjdhYS00NzYxLThlOTUtNzIyYjEyZThjNWEwLTEwMTk0Njc=/tiny/Commercial-Vehicle-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/efae7dce-3084-47ec-b8e7-65c3590f5f9f/small/cvg-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/efae7dce-3084-47ec-b8e7-65c3590f5f9f)\n\nSource: Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://ir.cvgrp.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.cvgrp.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://ir.cvgrp.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://ir.cvgrp.com/resources/investor-request-form/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## IR Contact\n\nRoss Collins or Stephen Poe Alpha IR Group\n\n[(312) 445-2870](tel:312-445-2870) CVGI@alpha-ir.com\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Peter Lugo joins the Company as President of our Electrical Systems segment, effective November 1, 2024. Mr. Lugo succeeds Richard Tajer, who will remain an employee of the Company until December 31, 2024. In addition, Carlos Jimenez has joined as Executive Vice President, Global Operations and Supply Chain. These appointments support CVG’s goals of growing its Electrical Systems business and improving overall operational execution, respectively. Both executives will report to James Ray, President and Chief Executive Officer of CVG. \n\nTo reinvigorate growth in its Electrical Systems segment, Mr. Lugo is accountable for day-to-day oversight of the electrical business with emphasis on the development and execution of commercial, engineering, and product management strategies while partnering with the operations team to achieve operational and financial goals. He most recently held the role of Senior Vice President, Electrical Products & Engineered Solutions at Southwire, where he led the development and execution of the overall business strategy resulting in sustainable growth through organic and M&A activity, including five acquisitions. Prior to his work at Southwire, Mr. Lugo held progressive leadership roles at Bullard, Eaton Corp., Phillips Petroleum, Switchgear Systems, and General Electric. He holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Polytechnical University of Puerto Rico. \n\nTo drive operational efficiencies across its manufacturing and supply network, Mr. Jimenez is responsible for the effective operation of the Company’s manufacturing function, developing and executing supply chain strategies and capabilities across CVG’s 20+ plant global manufacturing footprint. He most recently held the role of Vice President, Global Operations at Kennametal, Inc., where he was responsible for supply chain, operational excellence and distribution across 17 plants and 12 distribution centers. Prior to his work at Kennametal, Mr. Jimenez held progressive leadership roles at Stanley Black and Decker, Valeo Group, GKN Driveline, Mars Electronics International, Apisa and Ford Motor Company.

The results and comparisons presented below reflect continuing operations unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Highlights** _(Results from_ _Continuing_ _Operations; compared with prior year, where comparisons are noted)_\n\n  * Revenues of $171.8 million, down 15.3%, due primarily to a global softening in customer demand.\n  * Operating loss of $1.1 million, adjusted operating loss of $0.4 million, down compared to operating income and adjusted operating income of $8.9 million. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower sales volumes and operational inefficiencies.\n  * New business wins in the quarter of approximately $18 million when fully ramped, bringing the year-to-date total to $95 million; these wins were concentrated in our Electrical Systems segment, and include meaningful wins in our Vehicle Solutions segment.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share and adjusted net loss of $0.4 million, or $(0.01) per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million, down 64.8%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.5%, down from 6.0%.\n\n\n\nJames Ray, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Since taking over the CEO role eleven months ago, we have been tirelessly focused on reshaping the CVG operating model to create a more streamlined, lower cost, and customer-focused company. Our CVG team has been working diligently to divest non-strategic portfolio assets like Cab Structures and Industrial Automation, execute new program launches in Vehicle Solutions, initiate restructuring actions, pay down debt, and expand our global footprint in critical regions of Mexico and Morocco. Market conditions have made this transformation process even more difficult this year, as weaker customer demand and shifting production schedules have created operational and supply chain challenges. As a result of both market conditions and our portfolio actions, we have experienced incremental operational inefficiencies this year affecting our financial performance, especially during the third quarter. We are not happy with our performance and have taken significant steps to change the forward direction with expected performance improvement.”\n\nMr. Ray continued, “In addition to portfolio and restructuring actions, we’ve made senior management changes to drive growth in our Electrical Systems business and improve the efficiency of our supply chain and manufacturing operations while addressing structural costs and right sizing the company. This is an inflection point for CVG with many key actions completed this year. Despite softer end markets and slower new program ramps, we expect the actions we are taking today to help us reshape the company, driving incremental profitability with minimal added costs when customers’ demand improves. We believe this intense focus on operational excellence will make CVG more resilient and position us for margin expansion and growth with a commitment to value creation.”\n\nAndy Cheung, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Despite a challenging third quarter due to both external market conditions and internal operational issues, we successfully concluded multiple significant portfolio moves. The majority of proceeds from these actions were used to pay down debt. Executing these transactions led to short-term production inefficiencies that weighed on results during the quarter. We are currently addressing these operational issues to improve manufacturing capabilities and future competitiveness. With a more focused portfolio, we see potential to further streamline our enterprise cost structure. Ultimately, we expect these strategic actions will reposition our business for growth and margin expansion in 2025 and beyond.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results from Continuing Operations** _(amounts in millions except per share data and percentages)_\n\n**Third****Quarter**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nRevenues| $| 171.8| $| 202.9| $| (31.1)| (15.3)%  \nGross profit| $| 16.4| $| 29.3| $| (12.9)| (44.0)%  \nGross margin| 9.5%| 14.4%  \nAdjusted gross profit 1| $| 19.9| $| 29.4| $| (9.5)| (32.3)%  \nAdjusted gross margin 1| 11.6%| 14.5%  \nOperating income (loss)| $| (1.1)| $| 8.9| $| (10.0)| NM2  \nOperating margin| (0.6)%| 4.4%  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) 1| $| (0.4)| $| 8.9| $| (9.3)| NM2  \nAdjusted operating margin 1| (0.2)%| 4.4%  \nNet income (loss)| $| (0.9)| $| 4.7| $| (5.6)| NM2  \nAdjusted net income (loss) 1| $| (0.4)| $| 4.7| $| (5.1)| NM2  \nEarnings (loss) per share, diluted| $| (0.03)| $| 0.14| $| (0.17)| NM2  \nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share, diluted 1| $| (0.01)| $| 0.14| $| (0.15)| NM2  \nAdjusted EBITDA 1| $| 4.3| $| 12.2| $| (7.9)| (64.8)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin 1| 2.5%| 6.0%  \n1 See Appendix A for GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation  \n2 Not meaningful  \n  \n**Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations**\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 revenues were $171.8 million, compared to $202.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 15.3%. The overall decrease in revenues was due to lower sales as a result of a softening in customer demand in our Vehicle Solutions and Electrical Systems segments.\n  * Operating loss in the third quarter 2024 was $1.1 million compared to operating income of $8.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was attributable to the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, operational inefficiencies and increased restructuring charges. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating loss was $0.4 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $8.9 million in the prior year period.\n  * Interest associated with debt and other expenses was $2.4 million and $2.5 million for the third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations was $0.9 million, or $(0.03) per share, for the third quarter 2024 compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Third quarter 2024 adjusted net loss was $0.4 million, or $(0.01) per share, compared to adjusted net income of $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.\n\n\n\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company had $14.0 million of outstanding borrowings on its U.S. revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings on its China credit facility, $30.9 million of cash and $146.3 million of availability from the credit facilities, resulting in total liquidity of $177.2 million.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Segment Results**\n\n**_Vehicle Solutions Segment_**\n\n  * Revenues were $97.3 million compared to $115.2 million for the prior year period, a decrease of 15.6%, due to lower sales volume as a result of decreased customer demand and the wind-down of certain programs.\n  * Operating income was $5.1 million, compared to $8.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 37.9%, primarily attributable to lower customer demand, operational remediation investments, and increased freight costs, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses due to the gain on the sale of a building of $3.5 million. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating income was $3.8 million compared to $8.3 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**_Electrical Systems Segment_**\n\n  * Revenues were $43.4 million compared to $53.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 19.5%, primarily due to a global softening in the Construction & Agriculture end-markets and the phase out of certain lower margin business.\n  * Operating loss was $0.4 million compared to operating income of $5.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 106.6%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, restructuring activities, and unfavorable foreign exchange. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating income was $0.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**_Aftermarket & Accessories Segment_**\n\n  * Revenues were $31.1 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 8.0%, primarily as a result of lower sales volume due to a reduction of backlog in the prior period as well as decreased customer demand.\n  * Operating income was $3.1 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 27.0%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, operational inefficiencies and restructuring activities. Third quarter 2024 adjusted operating income was $3.9 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nCVG issued the following outlook for the full year 2024 which reflects both market developments and strategic portfolio actions undertaken:\n\n**Metric**| **Prior 2024 Outlook****(1)**| **Revised 2024 Outlook****(1)**  \n---|---|---  \nNet Sales| $730- $780| $710 - $740  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $28 - $36| $20 - $25  \n  \n(1) This outlook excludes any contribution from CVG’s Cab Structures or Industrial Automation businesses in 2024. On October 1, 2024, CVG closed the previously announced sale of the Cab Structures business, and received the final installment of the purchase price. Separately, CVG closed the sale of the Industrial Automation business on October 30, 2024.\n\nThis outlook reflects, among others, current industry forecasts for North America Class 8 truck builds. According to ACT Research, 2024 North American Class 8 truck production levels are expected to be at 316,000 units. The 2023 actual Class 8 truck builds according to the ACT Research was 340,247 units.\n\nBased on industry data, we continue to project global agriculture market demand for our customers' products to be down 15% to 20% and construction market demand to be down 10% to 15% in 2024.\n\n**GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation**\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release is included as Appendix A to this release.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nA conference call to discuss this press release is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

In general, the non-GAAP measures exclude items that (i) management believes reflect the Company’s multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company’s performance, engage in financial and operational planning and to determine incentive compensation.\n\nManagement provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on the Company’s financial and operating results and in comparing the Company’s performance to that of its competitors and to comparable reporting periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NzE3NyM2NTYzODkyIzIwMDc4OTQ=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzJkMDlkNzItNjdhYS00NzYxLThlOTUtNzIyYjEyZThjNWEwLTEwMTk0Njc=/tiny/Commercial-Vehicle-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/efae7dce-3084-47ec-b8e7-65c3590f5f9f/small/cvg-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/efae7dce-3084-47ec-b8e7-65c3590f5f9f)\n\nSource: Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://ir.cvgrp.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.cvgrp.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://ir.cvgrp.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://ir.cvgrp.com/resources/investor-request-form/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## IR Contact\n\nRoss Collins or Stephen Poe Alpha IR Group\n\n[(312) 445-2870](tel:312-445-2870) CVGI@alpha-ir.com\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share amounts and where specifically disclosed)\n1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nCommercial Vehicle Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, is a global provider of systems, assemblies and components to the global commercial vehicle market and\nthe electric vehicle market. References herein to the \"Company\", \"CVG\", \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\" refer to Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nWe have manufacturing operations in the United States, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Thailand, India, Australia and Morocco.\nOur products are primarily sold in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWe primarily manufacture customized products to meet the requirements of our customers. We believe our products are used by a majority of the North\nAmerican Commercial Truck manufacturers, many construction vehicle original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), parts and service dealers, and\ndistributors.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\")\nin the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and include the accounts of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries. Except as disclosed within these condensed notes to unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements, the adjustments made were of a\nnormal, recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed\nor omitted. Additionally, certain prior period amounts related to discontinued operations have been reclassified to conform to footnote presentation for the\ncurrent year, as further described in this section.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its cab structures business with operations in Kings\nMountain, North Carolina and met the held for sale criteria with respect to its Industrial Automation segment given the Company's intent to sell its First Source\nElectronics (FSE) business with operations in Elkridge, Maryland. These divestitures represent a strategic shift in CVG's business and, in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP, qualified as discontinued operations. As a result, the operating results related to the cab structures business and Industrial Automation segment have\nbeen reflected as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The assets and liabilities that are to be sold have met the\nrequirements to be classified within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets under a held for sale designation. See Note 18, Discontinued Operations, for\nadditional information on the divestitures.\nAs a result of classifying the Industrial Automation reporting segment as a discontinued operation, CVG is now comprised of three reportable segments:\nVehicle Solutions, Electrical Systems and Aftermarket & Accessories. The financial information reported for Vehicle Solutions and Aftermarket & Accessories\nexcludes the activity from the Kings Mountain, North Carolina facility as a result of the divestiture.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nThese estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing\nbasis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with\nprecision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic\nenvironment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nThese condensed notes to unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2023 Form 10-K\"), which includes a complete set of footnote disclosures, including the Company's significant accounting\npolicies.\n2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic\n280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring\n6\nTable of Contents\ndisclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each\nreported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate\nresources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This\nASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to\nadopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information\nabout a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis\nfor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made\navailable for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\n3.

The Credit Facilities mature on May 12, 2027.\nOn May 12, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a second amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Credit Agreement pursuant to which\nthe Lenders upsized the existing term loan facility to $175 million in aggregate principal amount and increased the revolving credit facility commitments by\n$25 million to an aggregate of $150 million in revolving credit facility commitments.\nOn July 30, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into an Amendment No. 3, which amends the Credit Agreement.\nAmendment No.3 amends the terms of the existing Credit Agreement to limit the mandatory prepayment requirements for certain specified asset dispositions of\nthe Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Company repaid $20.0 million in accordance with Amendment No.3 during the three months ended September\n30, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $14.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit of $1.1 million and availability of\n$134.9 million. Combined with availability under our China Credit Facility (described below) of approximately $11.4 million, total consolidated availability\nwas $146.3 million at September 30, 2024. The unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the Revolving Credit Facility of $0.8 million and $1.0\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are being amortized over the remaining life of the Credit Agreement. At December 31,\n2023, we had no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and we had outstanding letters of credit of $1.2 million.\nCovenants and other terms\nThe Credit Agreement includes (a) a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20:1.0, and (b) a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of\n3.00:1.0.\nWe were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nRepayment and prepayment\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to make quarterly amortization payments to the Term Loan Facility at an annualized rate of the loans under the\nTerm Loan Facility for every year as follows: 5.0%, 7.5%, 10.0%, 12.5% and 15.0%. The Credit Agreement also requires all outstanding amounts under the\nCredit Facilities to be repaid in full on the Maturity Date.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAmendment No. 3 amended the terms of the existing Credit Agreement and allowed mandatory prepayment requirements for certain specified asset\ndispositions of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to be applied to quarterly amortization payments. The Company repaid $20 million in accordance\nwith Amendment No.3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which will be applied to future amortization payments beginning with the\nSeptember 30, 2024 payment. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, for the future minimum principal payments due on long-term debt for the\nnext five years.\nForeign Facility\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we established a credit facility in China consisting of a line of credit which is subject to annual renewal (the \"China\nCredit Facility\"). The China Credit Facility was renewed during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, with availability of approximately $11.3 million\n(denominated in the local currency). We utilize the China Credit Facility to meet local working capital demands, fund letters of credit and bank guarantees, and\nsupport other short-term cash requirements of our China operations. We had no outstanding borrowings under the China Credit Facility as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had $11.4 million (denominated in the local currency and this amount varies based on the currency\nconversion rate) of availability under the China Credit Facility.\nCash Paid for Interest\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash payments for interest were $9.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively.\n5. Intangible Assets\nOur definite-lived intangible assets were comprised of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted-\nAverage Gross Net Gross Net\nAmortization Carrying Accumulated Carrying Carrying Accumulated Carrying\nPeriod Amount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount\nTrademarks/tradenames 30 years $ 8,277 $ (5,241) $ 3,036 $ 8,265 $ (5,070) $ 3,195\nCustomer relationships 15 years 5,339 (4,242) 1,097 12,972 (9,573) 3,399\n$ 13,616 $ (9,483) $ 4,133 $ 21,237 $ (14,643) $ 6,594\nThe aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $0.5 million and $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.\n6. Fair Value Measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels, and\nbases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted\nprices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, pension assets and liabilities. The carrying value of these\ninstruments approximates fair value as a result of the short duration of such instruments or due to the variability of the interest cost associated with such\ninstruments.\nRecurring Measurements\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts. Our derivative assets and liabilities represent foreign exchange contracts that are measured at fair value using\nobservable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and\n9\ncounterparty credit risk. Based on the utilization of these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. To manage our risk for\ntransactions denominated in Mexican Pesos and Czech Crown, we have entered into forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedge\ninstruments, which are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The gains and losses as a result of the changes in fair value of the\nhedge contract for transactions denominated in Mexican Pesos are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in cost of revenues in the\nperiod the related hedge transactions are settled. As of September 30, 2024, hedge contracts for transactions denominated in Czech Crown were not designated\nas a hedging instruments; therefore, they are marked-to-market and the fair value of agreements is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nwith the offsetting gains and losses recognized in other (income) expense and recognized in cost of revenues in the period the related hedge transactions are\nsettled in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest Rate Swaps. To manage our exposure to variable interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swaps to exchange, at a specified interval, the\ndifference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The interest rate swaps are\nintended to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on the Company and covers approximately 50% of outstanding debt under the Term Loan Facility. Any\nchanges in fair value are included in earnings or deferred through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the\noffset. Any ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedging relationship is recognized immediately in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are categorized as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nForeign exchange contract designated as\nhedging instruments $ 216 $ — $ 216 $ — $ 1,318 $ — $ 1,318 $ —\nInterest rate swap agreement $ 208 $ — $ 208 $ — $ 1,073 $ — $ 1,073 $ —\nLiabilities:\nForeign exchange contract designated as\nhedging instruments $ 4,773 $ — $ 4,773 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nForeign exchange contract not designated as\nhedging instruments $ 182 $ — $ 182 $ — $ 304 $ — $ 304 $ —\nThe following table summarizes the notional amount of our open foreign exchange contracts:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nU.S. $ U.S. $\nU.S. $ Equivalent U.S. $ Equivalent\nEquivalent Fair Value Equivalent Fair Value\nCommitments to buy or sell currencies - Foreign exchange contract\ndesignated as hedging instruments $ 75,533 $ 77,084 $ 56,741 $ 58,094\nCommitments to buy or sell currencies - Foreign exchange contract not\ndesignated as hedging instruments $ 9,702 $ 9,660 $ 16,608 $ 16,806\n10\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and presentation of derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nDerivative Asset\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet\nLocation September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nForeign exchange contract designated as hedging\ninstruments Other current assets $ 161 $ 1,179\nForeign exchange contract designated as hedging\ninstruments Other assets, net $ 55 $ 139\nInterest rate swap agreement Other assets, net $ 208 $ 1,073\nDerivative Liability\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet\nLocation September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nForeign exchange contract designated as hedging\ninstruments Accrued liabilities and other $ 4,488 $ —\nForeign exchange contract designated as hedging\ninstruments Other long-term liabilities $ 285 $ —\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as\nhedging instruments Accrued liabilities and other $ 182 $ 304\nDerivative Equity\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet\nLocation September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging Accumulated other comprehensive\ninstruments income (loss) $ (3,018) $ 1,354\nAccumulated other comprehensive\nInterest rate swap agreements income $ 2,256 $ 3,484\nThe following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLocation of Gain (Loss) on\nDerivatives Amount of Gain (Loss) on Derivatives Amount of Gain (Loss) on Derivatives\nRecognized in Income (Loss) Recognized in Income (Loss) Recognized in Income (Loss)\nForeign exchange contracts designated as\nhedging instruments Cost of revenues $ (1,236) $ 1,973 $ (634) $ 3,666\nInterest rate swap agreement Interest expense $ 408 $ 415 $ 1,227 $ 1,045\nInterest rate swap agreement settled in 2022 Interest expense $ 189 $ 189 $ 566 $ 566\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as\nhedging instruments Other (income) expense $ 52 $ (183) $ 150 $ 129\nWe consider the impact of our credit risk on the fair value of the contracts, as well as our ability to honor obligations under the contract.\n11\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of long-term debt obligations is based on a fair value model utilizing observable inputs.

Income tax expense is based on an estimated\nannual effective tax rate, which requires management to make its best estimate of annual pretax income or loss. During the year, management regularly updates\nforecasted annual pretax results for the various countries in which the Company operates based on changes in factors such as prices, shipments, product mix,\nmaterial inflation and manufacturing operations. To the extent that actual 2024 pretax results for U.S. and foreign income or loss vary from estimates, the actual\nincome tax expense recognized in 2024 could be different from the forecasted amount used to estimate the income tax expense for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for taxes, net of refunds received, were $6.4 million and $9.2 million, respectively.\n9.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases - As disclosed in Note 7, Leases, we lease office, warehouse and manufacturing space and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements\nthat generally require us to pay maintenance, insurance, taxes and other expenses in addition to annual rental fees. As of September 30, 2024, our equipment\nleases did not provide for any material guarantee of a specified portion of residual values.\nGuarantees - Costs associated with guarantees are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nThe most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of available facts; where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the\nminimum is accrued. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no such guarantees.\nLitigation - We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to product liability\nclaims, customer and supplier disputes, service provider disputes, examinations by taxing authorities, employment disputes, workers’ compensation claims,\nunfair labor practice charges, OSHA investigations, intellectual property disputes and environmental claims arising out of the conduct of our businesses.\nManagement believes that the Company maintains adequate insurance and that we have established reserves for issues that are probable and estimable in\namounts that are adequate to cover reasonable adverse judgments not covered by insurance. Based upon the information available to management and\ndiscussions with legal counsel, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate outcome of the various legal actions and claims that are incidental to our\nbusiness are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows; however, such\nmatters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes of individual matters are not predictable with any degree of assurance.\nWarranty - We are subject to warranty claims for products that fail to perform as expected due to design or manufacturing deficiencies. Depending on the terms\nunder which we supply products to our customers, a customer may hold us responsible for\n17\nTable of Contents\nsome or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products when the product supplied did not perform as represented. Our policy is to record\nprovisions for estimated future customer warranty costs based on historical trends and for specific claims. These amounts, as they relate to the periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are included within accrued liabilities and other in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn July 24, 2023, one of our customers issued a voluntary safety recall related to certain wiper system components supplied by us. To the extent a loss occurs\nthat is attributed to us, we believe that we have reasonable levels of insurance coverage to mitigate recall exposure risk. It is reasonably possible that we will\nincur additional losses and fees above the amount accrued for warranty claims but we cannot estimate a range of such reasonably possible losses or fees related\nto these claims at this time. There are no assurances, however, that settlements reached and/or adverse judgments received, if any, will not exceed amounts\nnormally accrued.\nThe following presents a summary of the warranty provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nBalance - December 31, 2023 $ 1,458\nProvision for warranty claims 1 1,329\nDeduction for payments made and other adjustments (1,497)\nBalance - September 30, 2024 $ 1,290\n1. Provision for warranty claims includes $0.1 million of expense that is attributable to cab structures business and included in discontinued operations\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nDebt Payments - As disclosed in Note 4, Debt, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to repay a fixed amount of principal on a quarterly basis and make\nvoluntary prepayments that coincide with certain events.\nThe following table provides future minimum principal payments due on long-term debt for the next five years. The existing long-term debt agreement matures\nin 2027; no payments are due thereafter:\nTotal\nRemainder of 2024 $ —\n2025 $ 8,437\n2026 $ 24,063\n2027 $ 96,500\n16. Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that are evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”),\nwhich is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Each of these segments consists of a number of manufacturing facilities. Certain of our facilities\nmanufacture and sell products through multiple segments. Our segments are more specifically described below.\nCVG's reportable segments were impacted in the current period due to the divestiture of the cab structure business with operations in Kings Mountain, North\nCarolina and the expected divestiture of the Industrial Automation segment. As a result of classifying the Industrial Automation reporting segment as a\ndiscontinued operation, CVG is now comprised of three reportable segments: Vehicle Solutions, Electrical Systems and Aftermarket & Accessories. The\nfinancial information reported for Vehicle Solutions and Aftermarket & Accessories excludes the activity from the Kings Mountain, North Carolina facility due\nto the divestiture.\nThe Vehicle Solutions segment designs, manufactures and sells the following products:\n• Commercial vehicle seats for the global commercial vehicle markets including heavy duty trucks, medium duty trucks, last mile delivery trucks and\nvans, construction and agriculture equipment in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. This segment includes a portion of the company’s activities\nin the electric vehicle market.\n• Plastic & Trim components primarily for the North America commercial vehicle market and power sports markets; and Cab structures for the North\nAmerican medium-duty/heavy-duty (\"MD/HD\") truck market.\nThe Electrical Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells the following products:\n• Cable and harness assemblies for both high and low voltage applications, control boxes, dashboard assemblies and design and engineering for these\napplications.\n• The end markets for these products are construction, agricultural, industrial, automotive (both internal combustion and electric vehicles), truck,\nmining, rail, marine, power generation and the military/defense industries in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe Aftermarket & Accessories segment designs, manufactures and sells the following products:\n• Seats and components sold into the commercial vehicle channels that provide repair and refurbishing. These channels include Original Equipment\nService (\"OES\") centers and retail distributors, and are spread across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n• Commercial vehicle accessories including wipers, mirrors, and sensors. These products are sold both as Original Equipment and as repair products.\n• Office seats primarily sold into the commercial and home office furniture distribution channels in Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nCorporate expenses consist of certain overhead and shared costs that are not directly attributable to the operations of a segment. For purposes of business\nsegment performance measurement, some of these costs that are for the benefit of the operations are allocated based on a combination of methodologies. The\ncosts that are not allocated to a segment are considered stewardship costs and remain at corporate in our segment reporting.\nThe following tables present financial information for the Company's reportable segments for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAftermarket and\nVehicle Solutions Electrical Systems Accessories Corporate/Other Total\nRevenues $ 97,296 $ 43,380 $ 31,096 $ — $ 171,772\nGross profit 8,774 2,213 5,474 (40) 16,421\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 3,629 2,598 2,328 8,926 17,481\nOperating income (loss) $ 5,145 $ (385) $ 3,146 $ (8,966) $ (1,060)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nAftermarket and\nVehicle Solutions Electrical Systems Accessories Corporate/Other Total\nRevenues $ 115,235 $ 53,862 $ 33,800 $ — $ 202,897\nGross profit 15,050 7,881 6,416 (38) 29,309\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 6,761 2,018 2,104 9,506 20,389\nOperating income (loss) $ 8,289 $ 5,863 $ 4,312 $ (9,544) $ 8,920\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAftermarket and\nVehicle Solutions Electrical Systems Accessories Corporate/Other Total\nRevenues $ 312,785 $ 149,327 $ 97,951 $ — $ 560,063\nGross profit 32,177 9,934 18,091 (158) 60,044\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 15,985 7,799 6,228 25,519 55,531\nOperating income (loss) $ 16,192 $ 2,135 $ 11,863 $ (25,677) $ 4,513\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nAftermarket and\nVehicle Solutions Electrical Systems Accessories Corporate/Other Total\nRevenues $ 362,820 $ 172,236 $ 106,691 $ — $ 641,747\nGross profit 49,263 26,524 21,071 (144) 96,714\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 19,609 6,932 6,017 28,352 60,910\nOperating income (loss) $ 29,654 $ 19,592 $ 15,054 $ (28,496) $ 35,804\n19\nTable of Contents\n17.

Discontinued Operations\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its cab structures business with operations in Kings Mountain, North Carolina for\napproximately $40 million. On September 6, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Purchase Agreement whereby the transaction closed on\nSeptember 6, 2024 with the Company receiving $20 million of the purchase price on September 6, 2024 and $20 million (subject to adjustment) on October 1,\n2024. The decision to divest this business was part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to the cyclical Class 8 market, lower our customer concentration,\nremove complexity from our business, and improves our return profile. As a result of the transaction, CVG recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of the business\nof approximately $27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded a Note receivable of $20.0 million in its balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The $20.0 million Note receivable was subsequently collected on October 1, 2024.\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its First Source Electronics (FSE) business with operations in Elkridge, Maryland\nfor approximately $1.5 million, with a note in the amount of $500 thousand and earn out potential of an additional $1.5 million subject to certain criteria. The\nElkridge facility is the primary manufacturing facility of the Company's Industrial Automation segment. The decision to divest this business was part of our\nstrategy to continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses and product lines for strategic fit and continued investment. As of September 30, 2024, the assets\nand liabilities of the Industrial Automation segment are classified as held for sale on the balance sheets, net of the\n20\nTable of Contents\nestimated write-down loss as of September 30, 2024. CVG recorded an estimated after-tax loss on the contemplated sale of the Industrial Automation business\nof approximately $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe determined that the sale of the cab structures and Industrial Automation businesses represent discontinued operations as they constitute disposals of a\nproduct line and an operating segment, respectively, meet the held for sale criteria, and are a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and\nfinancial results (individually and collectively). As a result, we reclassified the related earnings (loss) from continuing operations to earnings (loss) from\ndiscontinued operations - net of income taxes on the consolidated statement of earnings (loss) for all the periods presented. No amounts for shared general and\nadministrative operating support expense were allocated to the discontinued operation.\nThe Company has continuing involvement with the cab structures business through a transition services agreement (TSA), pursuant to which the Company and\nBuyer parties provide certain service to each other for a period of time following the disposition, up to one year. While the transition services are expected to\nvary in duration depending upon the type of service provided, the Company expects to reduce costs as the transition services are completed. The Company\ncollected a total of $2.0 million related to the transition services agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was recognized in\nContinuing operations, Other (income) expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the individual discontinued operations to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\nCab structures business $ 18,814 $ 2,130 $ 22,327 $ 7,060\nIndustrial Automation segment (8,417) 479 (10,739) (1,991)\nTotal income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 10,397 $ 2,609 $ 11,588 $ 5,069\nThe following tables present reconciliations of the captions within CVG's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations attributable to each discontinued\noperation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to\nCab structures business:\nRevenues $ 24,795 $ 30,770 $ 89,187 $ 98,066\nCost of revenues 33,627 27,970 93,367 88,745\nGross profit (8,832) 2,800 (4,180) 9,321\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes (8,832) 2,800 (4,180) 9,321\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes of discontinued operations (425) 670 714 2,261\nGain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of income\ntaxes 27,221 — 27,221 —\nNet income from discontinued operations, net of income\ntaxes $ 18,814 $ 2,130 $ 22,327 $ 7,060\n21\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to\nIndustrial Automation segment:\nRevenues $ 5,350 $ 13,020 $ 14,641 $ 31,777\nCost of revenues 5,185 11,205 15,107 30,278\nGross profit 165 1,815 (466) 1,499\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 747 1,087 3,009 3,588\nOperating income (loss) (582) 728 (3,475) (2,089)\nInterest expense 64 125 201 398\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes (646) 603 (3,676) (2,487)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes of discontinued operations (38) 124 (746) (496)\nLoss on disposition of discontinued operations, net of income\ntaxes (7,809) — (7,809) —\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of\nincome taxes $ (8,417) $ 479 $ (10,739) $ (1,991)\nThe following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities of the Industrial Automation segment as of September 30, 2024, and of the cab structures\nand Industrial Automation segment as of December 31, 2023 that are classified as held for sale in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands).\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccount receivable, net 4,964 4,603\nInventories 3,710 10,815\nOther current assets — 185\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 232 —\nIntangible assets, net 3,093 —\nOther assets, net 1,156 —\nWrite-down loss on disposal group (8,204) —\nCurrent assets held for sale 4,951 15,603\nProperty, plant and equipment, net — 4,545\nIntangible assets, net — 4,628\nOther assets, net — 1,957\nNon current assets held for sale — 11,130\nTotal assets held for sale $ 4,951 $ 26,733\nAccounts payable 2,069 2,068\nAccrued liabilities and other 2,067 1,208\nOther long-term liabilities 115 —\nCurrent liabilities held-for-sale 4,251 3,276\nOther long-term liabilities — 870\nNoncurrent liabilities held-for-sale — 870\nTotal liabilities held for sale $ 4,251 $ 4,146\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present reconciliations of the captions within CVG's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows attributable to discontinued\noperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nCVG is a global provider of systems, assemblies and components to the global commercial vehicle market and the electric vehicle market. We deliver real\nsolutions to complex design, engineering and manufacturing problems while creating positive change for our customers, industries, and communities we serve.\nWe have manufacturing operations in the United States, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Morocco, Thailand, India and Australia.\nOur products are primarily sold in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWe primarily manufacture customized products to meet the requirements of our customers. We believe our products are used by a majority of the North\nAmerican Commercial Truck markets and many construction vehicle OEMs, parts and service dealers, and distributors.\nKey Developments\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company and SVO, LLC (\"Buyer\") entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company would sell substantially all of the\nassets of the Company's business of manufacturing and assembling structured products, including cabs for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, at its facility in\nKings Mountain, North Carolina (the Cab Structures business). On September 6, 2024, the Company and Buyer entered into an Amendment to the Purchase\nAgreement whereby the transaction closed on September 6, 2024 with the Buyer paying the Company $20 million of the $40 million Purchase Price. Pursuant\nto the Amended Purchase Agreement, the Parties agreed (i) that the remaining $20 million of the Purchase Price would be paid on October 1, 2024, (ii) that the\nAssigned Contracts (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and the employees of Seller would transfer to Buyer on October 1, 2024, and (iii) the inventory\nwould be valued as of October 1, 2024, for purposes of determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price.The Company received the remaining portion of the\nPurchase Price on October 1, 2024. The net proceeds of the transaction were approximately $40 million. The Company used the proceeds for debt paydown\nand other general corporate purposes. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of the business of approximately $27.2 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024.\nOn July 30, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into Amendment No. 3, to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 3\namended the terms of the existing Credit Agreement to limit the mandatory prepayment requirements for certain specified asset dispositions of the Company\nand certain of its subsidiaries. The Company repaid $20 million in accordance with Amendment No.3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company announced that it has retained an investment banking firm to explore strategic alternatives for its\nIndustrial Automation business. On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its First Source Electronics (FSE) business with\noperations in Elkridge, Maryland for approximately $1.5 million, with a note in the amount of $500 thousand and earn out potential of an additional $1.5\nmillion subject to certain criteria. The Elkridge facility is the primary manufacturing facility of the Company's Industrial Automation segment. CVG recorded\nan estimated after-tax loss on the contemplated sale of the Industrial Automation business of approximately $7.8 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024.\nThe cab structures and Industrial Automation segment divestitures represent a strategic shift in CVG's business and, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, qualified\nas discontinued operations. As a result, the operating results and cash flows related to the cab structures business and Industrial Automation segment have been\nreflected as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The\nassets and liabilities that are to be sold have met the requirements to be classified within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets under a held for sale\ndesignation. See Note 18, Discontinued Operations, for additional information on the divestitures.\nCertain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations that were previously allocated to the Kings Mountain facility and Industrial Automation segment do not qualify for classification within\ndiscontinued operations and are now reported as selling, general and\n24\nTable of Contents\nadministrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Corporate and other segment. CVG is implementing plans to\neliminate these costs as part of its restructuring program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management approved restructuring programs to align the\nCompany’s cost structure to support margin expansion in key focus areas. The programs include workforce reductions, footprint optimization, and fundamental\nreorganization initiatives that were implemented to drive efficiencies and reduce operating costs in line with our go-forward business and financial objectives.\nWe incurred $9.8 million of expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to these programs.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe table below sets forth certain consolidated operating data for the three months ended September 30 (dollars are in thousands):\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ 171,772 $ 202,897 $ (31,125) (15.3)%\nGross profit 16,421 29,309 (12,888) (44.0)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 17,481 20,389 (2,908) (14.3)\nOther (income) expense (1,033) 383 (1,416) NM1\nInterest expense 2,371 2,489 (118) (4.7)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes (1,515) 1,367 (2,882) NM1\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations (883) 4,681 (5,564) NM1\n1. Not meaningful\nRevenues. The decrease in consolidated revenues resulted from:\n• a $28.4 million, or 16.8%, decrease in OEM and other revenues;\n• a $2.7 million, or 8.0%, decrease in aftermarket and OES sales; and\nThe decrease in revenues of 15.3% is due primarily to a softening in customer demand in our Vehicle Solutions and Electrical Systems segments.\nGross Profit. Included in gross profit is cost of revenues, which consists primarily of raw materials and purchased components for our products, wages and\nbenefits for our employees and overhead expenses such as manufacturing supplies, facility rent and utilities costs related to our operations.

As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expense was 10.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to 10.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024 results include charges of $0.7 million\nassociated with restructuring programs.\nOther Income. Other Income increased $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase in other income primarily related to TSA fees of $2.0 million recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest Expense. Interest associated with our debt was $2.4 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe decrease in interest expense primarily related to lower average debt balances offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt during the respective\ncomparative periods.\n25\nTable of Contents\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes. Income tax benefit of $1.5 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income\ntax expense of $1.4 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The period over period change in income tax was primarily attributable to\na $8.4 million decrease in pre-tax income versus the prior year period.\nNet Income (Loss) from continuing operations. Net loss from continuing operations was $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto net income of $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in Aftermarket & Accessories Segment revenues of $2.7 million primarily resulted from lower sales volume due to a reduction of\nbacklog in the prior period as well as decreased customer demand.\nGross Profit. The decrease in gross profit of $0.9 million is primarily attributable to lower sales volume, operational inefficiencies and restructuring related\nexpenses. The cost of revenues decreased in line with the sales decrease of 8.0%, driven by a decrease in raw material and purchased component costs of $3.5\nmillion, or 20.4%; offset by an increase in labor and overhead expenses of $1.8 million, or 17.6%.\nAs a percentage of revenues, gross profit margin was 17.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.0% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower sales volumes, operational inefficiencies and restructuring related\nexpenses. The three months ended September 30, 2024 results include charges of $0.8 million associated with the restructuring program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n27\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe table below sets forth certain consolidated operating data for the nine months ended September 30, (dollars are in thousands):\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ 560,063 $ 641,747 $ (81,684) (12.7)%\nGross profit 60,044 96,714 (36,670) (37.9)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 55,531 60,910 (5,379) (8.8)\nOther (income) expense (615) 488 (1,103) NM1\nInterest expense 6,974 7,910 (936) (11.8)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes (1,110) 6,345 (7,455) NM1\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations (736) 21,061 (21,797) NM1\n1. Not meaningful\nRevenues. The decrease in consolidated revenues resulted from:\n• a $72.9 million, or 13.6%, decrease in OEM and other revenues; and\n• a $8.7 million, or 8.2%, decrease in aftermarket and OES sales.\nThe decrease in revenues of $81.7 million is primarily driven by a softening in customer demand across all segments, and the wind-down of certain programs\nin our Vehicle Solutions segment.\nGross Profit. The $36.7 million decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, and increased\nrestructuring charges. Cost of revenues decreased $45.0 million, or 8.3%, as a result of a decrease in raw material and purchased component costs of $44.2\nmillion, or 13.1%, and a decrease in labor and overhead expenses of $0.8 million, or 0.4%. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit margin was 10.7% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 results\ninclude charges of $8.6 million associated with the restructuring programs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $5.4 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a\nresult of the gain on the sale of a building of $3.5 million and reduced incentive compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in salary expense and\nconsulting spend during the 2024 period. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expense was 9.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n9.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 results include charges of $1.2 million associated with the\nrestructuring programs.\nOther Income. Other Income increased $1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase in other income primarily related to TSA fees of $2.0 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest Expense. Interest associated with our debt was $7.0 million and $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe decrease in interest expense primarily related to lower average debt balances offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt during the respective\ncomparative periods.\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes. An income tax benefit of $1.1 million and income tax expense of $6.3 million were recorded for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The period over period change in income tax was primarily attributable to the $29.3 million decrease in pre-tax\nincome versus the prior year period.\nIn 2021, as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (\"OECD\") Inclusive Framework, 140 member countries agreed to the\nimplementation of the Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax (\"Pillar Two\") of 15%. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including administrative\nguidance on how Pillar Two rules should be interpreted and applied by jurisdictions as they adopt Pillar Two. These changes, when enacted by various\ncountries in which we do business, may increase our taxes in these countries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including\n28\nTable of Contents\nfuture actions taken by foreign governments in response to Pillar Two, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future\nyears. We continue to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative adoption by individual countries.\nNet Income (loss) from continuing operations. Net loss from continuing operations was $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto net income of $21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income is attributable to the factors noted above.\nSegment Results\nVehicle Solutions Segment Results\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe table below sets forth certain Vehicle Solutions Segment operating data for the nine months ended September 30, (dollars are in thousands):\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ 312,785 $ 362,820 $ (50,035) (13.8)%\nGross profit 32,177 49,263 (17,086) (34.7)\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 15,985 19,609 (3,624) (18.5)\nOperating income 16,192 29,654 (13,462) (45.4)\nRevenues.

The decrease in Aftermarket & Accessories Segment revenues of $8.7 million primarily resulted from lower sales volume due to an increase of\nbacklog in the prior period as well as decreased customer demand.\nGross Profit. The decrease in gross profit of $3.0 million is primarily attributable to the lower sales volume. The decrease in cost of revenues was driven by\na decrease in raw material and purchased component costs of $8.5 million, or 15.6%, offset by an increase in labor and overhead expenses of $2.7 million, or\n8.6%.\nAs a percentage of revenues, gross profit margin was 18.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.7% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This was primarily due to lower sales volume, product mix, higher labor and benefit costs, and restructuring related expenses.

SG&A expenses increased $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of $177.2 million, including $30.9 million of cash and $146.3 million of availability from its U.S.\nand China credit facilities.\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 were operating income, cash and availability under our credit facility. We believe that these sources\nof liquidity will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service throughout the next twelve months. However, no\nassurance can be given that this will be the case. We also rely on the timely collection of receivables as a source of liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had\noutstanding letters of credit of $1.1 million and borrowing availability of $146.3 million from our U.S. and China credit facilities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash of $30.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company had a $0.1 million deferred tax liability as of September 30,\n2024 for the expected future income tax implications of repatriating cash from the foreign subsidiaries for which indefinite reinvestment is not expected.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCovenants and Liquidity\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement, as discussed in Note 4, Debt, may be affected by economic or business conditions beyond\nour control. Based on our current forecast, we believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with the financial maintenance covenants and the fixed\ncharge coverage ratio covenant and other covenants in the Credit Agreement for the next twelve months; however, no assurances can be given that we will be\nable to comply. We base our forecasts on historical experience, industry forecasts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. If actual results are substantially different than our current forecast, we may not be able to comply with our financial covenants.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (6,835) $ 29,990\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 12,868 (15,196)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (12,927) 531\nEffect of currency exchange rate changes on cash (69) (857)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash $ (6,963) $ 14,468\nOperating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $6.8 million compared to net cash provided by\noperating activities of $30.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to a lower net\nincome from continuing and discontinued operations, including cash used to support restructuring programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as\ncompared to higher net income offset by an increase in working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nInvesting activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities of $12.9 million compared to net cash used in\ninvesting activities of $15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to $23.0 million proceeds from sale of the Company's cab\nstructures and FinishTEK businesses during the current period and $4.5 million proceeds from the sale of a building. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures to\nbe in the range of $20 million to $25 million.\nFinancing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $12.9 million compared to net cash provided by\nfinancing activities of $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to the $20.0 million term loan repayment, offset\nby an increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund working capital.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nThe debt and credit facilities descriptions in Note 4, Debt are incorporated in this section by reference.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”). For a comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies, see \"Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\", to our consolidated financial\nstatements in Item 8 in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. These estimates require management's\nmost difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain. We review the development,\nselection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. For information about critical accounting\nestimates, see Critical Accounting Estimates in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2023\nForm 10-K.

Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believe”, “anticipate”, “plan”, “expect”,\n“intend”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “project”, “continue”, “likely”, and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-\nlooking statements. The important factors discussed in “Item 1A - Risk Factors”, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nindicated by forward-looking statements made herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such forward-looking statements represent\nmanagement’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Investors are warned that actual results may differ from management’s expectations.\nAdditionally, various economic and competitive factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements,\nincluding, but not limited to, factors which are outside our control.\nAny forward-looking statement that we make in this report speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-\nlooking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments.

Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\" in our 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from\nthose disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures. Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods\nspecified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.\nWe evaluated, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer\nand principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. Our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not\nexpect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The\ndesign of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nFurther, because of the inherent limitations in control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\n32\nTable of Contents\nmisstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake. Controls\nalso can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of\nany system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed\nin achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.\nOver time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n33\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1 Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, product liability claims,\ncustomer and supplier disputes, service provider disputes, examinations by taxing authorities, employment disputes, workers’ compensation claims, unfair\nlabor practice charges, OSHA investigations, intellectual property disputes and environmental claims arising out of the conduct of our businesses. Based upon\nthe information available to management and discussions with legal counsel, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate outcome of the various legal\nactions and claims that are incidental to our business are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position, results of\noperations, stockholders' equity or cash flows; however, such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes of individual matters are not\npredictable with any degree of assurance.\nITEM 1A Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q, the risk factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and other risks discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K\nand our filings with the SEC since December 31, 2023.

In general, the non-GAAP measures exclude items that (i) management believes reflect the Company’s multi-year corporate activities; or (ii)\nrelate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures internally to evaluate the Company’s performance, engage in financial and operational planning and to determine incentive\ncompensation.\nManagement provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and\nevents on the Company’s financial and operating results and in comparing the Company’s performance to that of its competitors and to comparable\nreporting periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to,\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements are set forth in the\nsupplemental information.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 14\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(in millions) Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nOperating Income/(Loss) (1.1) 8.9 4.5 35.8\nRestructuring 4.2 - 9.8 0.4\nGain on sale of fixed assets (3.5) (3.5)\nAdjusted Operating Income (0.4) 8.9 10.7 36.2\n% of Revenues (0.2%) 4.4% 1.9% 5.6%\nNet Income/(Loss) (0.9) 4.7 (0.7) 21.1\nInterest Expense 2.4 2.5 7.0 7.9\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes (1.5) 1.4 (1.1) 6.3\nDepreciation Expense 3.6 3.4 10.4 9.7\nAmortization Expense 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.8\nEBITDA 3.7 12.2 16.0 45.9\n% of Revenues 2.1% 6.0% 2.9% 7.1%\nEBITDA Adjustments\nRestructuring 4.2 - 9.8 0.4\n(Gain) loss on sale of fixed assets (3.5) - (3.5) -\nAdjusted EBITDA 4.4 12.2 22.3 46.3\n% of Revenues 2.5% 6.0% 4.0% 7.2%\nQ3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 15\nNote: totals may not match due to rounding\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Diluted EPS\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n(in millions except for share information)\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income/(Loss) from continuing operations (0.9) 4.7 (0.7) 21.1\nOperating income (loss) adjustments 0.7 - 6.2 0.4\nAdjusted (benefit) provision for income taxes (0.2) - (1.6) (0.1)\nAdjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations (0.4) 4.7 3 .9 21.4\nDiluted EPS (0.03) 0.14 (0.02) 0.63\nAdjustments to diluted EPS 0.02 - 0.14 0.01\nAdjusted diluted EPS (0.01) 0.14 0.12 0.64\nQ3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 16\nNote: totals may not match due to rounding\nSegment GAAP to Non-GAAP QTD\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nVehicle Electrical\n(in millions)\nSolutions Systems Aftermarket Corporate Total\nOperating Income/(Loss) 5.1 (0.4) 3.1 (9.0) (1.1)\nRestructuring 2.2 1.3 0.8 - 4.2\nGain on Sale of Fixed Assets (3.5) - - - (3.5)\nAdjusted Operating Income/(Loss) 3.8 0.9 3.9 (9.0) (0.4)\n% of Revenue 3.9% 2.1% 12.5% - (0.2)%\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nVehicle Electrical\n(in millions)\nSolutions Systems Aftermarket Corporate Total\nOperating Income/(Loss) 8.3 5.9 4.3 (9.5) 8.9\nRestructuring - - - - -\nAdjusted Operating Income/(Loss) 8.3 5.9 4.3 (9.5) 8.9\n% of Revenue 7.2% 10.9% 12.8% - 4.4%\nNote: totals may not match due to rounding Q3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 17\nSegment GAAP to Non-GAAP YTD\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nVehicle Electrical\n(in millions)\nSolutions Systems Aftermarket Corporate Total\nOperating Income/(Loss) 16.2 2.1 11.9 (25.7) 4.5\nRestructuring 4.9 3.7 1.0 0.2 9.8\nGain on Sale of Assets (3.5) - - - (3.5)\nAdjusted Operating Income/(Loss) 17.5 5.9 12.8 (25.5) 10.7\n% of Revenue 5.6% 3.9% 13.1% - 1.9%\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nVehicle Electrical\n(in millions)\nSolutions Systems Aftermarket Corporate Total\nOperating Income/(Loss) 29.7 19.6 15.1 (28.5) 35.8\nRestructuring 0.4 0.0 - - 0.4\nAdjusted Operating Income/(Loss) 30.1 19.6 15.1 (28.5) 36.2\n% of Revenue 8.3% 11.4% 14.1% - 5.6%\nQ3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 18\nNote: totals may not match due to rounding\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Cash Flow Information\n(in millions) Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS\nCash Flow from Operations $ (4.2) $ 16.9 $ (2.3) $ 21.0\nCapital Expenditures1 1.6 (5.6) (9.3) (14.8)\nProceeds From Sale of Business 19,8 - 23.0 -\nFree Cash Flow from Continuing Operations 17.1 11.3 11.4 6.2\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nCash Flow from Operations $ (12.9) $ 1.5 $ (4.6) $ 9.0\nCapital Expenditures1 (0.4) (0.4) (0.8) (0.4)\nFree Cash Flow from Discontinued Operations (13.3) 1.1 (5.4) 8.6\nTOTAL COMPANY\nCash Flow from Operations $ (17.1) $ 18.5 $ (6.8) $ 30.0\nCapital Expenditures1 1.2 (6.0) (10.1) (15.2)\nProceeds From Sale of Business 19,8 - 23.0 -\nFree Cash Flow 3.9 12.5 6.0 14.8\n1Net of proceeds from disposal/sale of property, plant, and equipment\nQ3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 19\nNote: totals may not match due to rounding\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(in millions) Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024\nNet Income/(Loss) 22.3 1.4 (1.3) (0.9)\nInterest Expense 2.3 2.2 2.4 2.4\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes (21.3) 0.7 (0.3) (1.5)\nDepreciation Expense 3.4 3.5 3.5 3.6\nAmortization Expense 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1\nEBITDA 6.9 8.0 4.5 3.7\nEBITDA Adjustments\nRestructuring 1.4 1.8 3.7 4.2\n(Gain) loss on sale of fixed assets - - - (3.5)\nExecutive transition 0.7 - -\nAdjusted EBITDA 9.0 9.8 8.2 4.4\nAdjust EBITDA (TTM) 31.4\nLong-Term Debt at End of Quarter 125.8\nCurrent Portion of LT and ST Debt at End of Quarter 3.0\nCash at End of Quarter (30.9)\nNet Debt at End of Quarter 97.9\nCash Proceeds Received on 10/1/2024 (20.0)\nNet Debt Adjusted for Cash Proceeds 77.9\nLeverage Ratio (Continuing Operations, adjusted for Cash Proceeds) 2.5x\nQ3 2024 Earnings Presentation - 20\nNote: totals may not match due to rounding"
