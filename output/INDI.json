(Nasdaq: INDI), an automotive solutions innovator, today announced third quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2024. Third quarter 2024 revenue increased 3.1% sequentially to $54.0 million, above the mid-point of the outlook with Non-GAAP gross margin up sequentially to 50.4 percent. On a GAAP basis, third quarter 2024 operating loss was $49.9 million compared to $136.2 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.8 million, versus $13.0 million during the same period last year. Third quarter 2024 GAAP loss per share was $0.28, while Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.09. \n\n“indie exceeded consensus revenue forecasts in Q3, despite the persisting near-term challenges impacting the automotive industry,\" said Donald McClymont, indie's co-founder and chief executive officer. “Crucially, the market for indie’s innovative portfolio remains strong, driven by the long-term catalysts of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), in-cabin user experience and electrification, consistent with the 12% year-over-year increase in our strategic backlog to $7.1 billion. Our continued design-win momentum has been broad across our extensive product portfolio, particularly in vision and radar, which now comprise over 72% of our strategic backlog. Delivering class-leading solutions and support to our global OEM and Tier 1 customer base ensures that indie remains well-positioned to capture significant value in the rapidly growing automotive semiconductor market opportunity.” \n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Expanded strategic backlog to $7.1 billion, driven by new ADAS program wins \n\n\n  * Flagship ADAS programs in customer homologation, are on track for 2025 volume shipments \n\n\n  * Secured design-win for LiDAR optical engine and photonics module program \n\n\n  * Captured design-win for Vision processor in Avatr12 EV, a leading Chinese OEM \n\n\n  * Extended ambient lighting design-wins in China, across Xiaomi, Avatr, BYD & Li Auto models \n\n\n  * Secured multiple wins for a large North American EV maker with high-performance custom networking solutions \n\n\n\n**Q4 2024 Outlook**\n\n_We provide guidance on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to reconcile such results and guidance to GAAP is difficult to estimate and dependent on future events outside of our control and, therefore, is not available without unreasonable efforts. Please refer to the header captioned “Discussion Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this release for a further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures._\n\n“For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect indie’s revenue to increase by more than 7 percent sequentially at the mid-point, once again outpacing the industry,” said Raja Bal, indie’s chief financial officer. “Based upon the continuing strong design-win activity for indie’s new radar and vision products, we anticipate a return to our industry-leading growth trajectory in 2025 and beyond.” \n\n**indie’s Q3 2024 Conference Call**\n\nindie Semiconductor will host a conference call with analysts to discuss its third quarter 2024 results and business outlook today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.

Such statements can be identified by words such as “will likely result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “may” or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future business and financial performance and prospects, including expectations regarding our strategic backlog and design win momentum, conditions of the automotive industry and our belief regarding the market for our product portfolio, expectations regarding our guidance for top line growth and our belief that we are on track to return to industry-leading growth trajectory in 2025 and beyond. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results included in such forward-looking statements.

We do not undertake, and we expressly disclaim, any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this announcement or in our other public filings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\nIn addition, our strategic backlog estimate included herein represents the revenue we expect to recognize from product orders within the next ten years. The estimate of our strategic backlog requires substantial judgment and is based on a number of assumptions, including management’s current assessment of customer and third-party contracts that exist as of the date the estimate is made, as well as revenues from expected contract renewals and/or expected design wins, to the extent that we believe that recognition of the related revenue will be realizable within the next ten years. Although we believe the assumptions underlying our strategic backlog estimate are reasonable, they are not guarantees and we can give no assurance that we will be able to recognize the revenues reflected in the strategic backlog estimate. A number of factors could result in actual revenues being less than the amounts reflected in strategic backlog. Our customers or third-party partners may attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons, including mergers, changes in their financial condition, changes to their products or development cycles unrelated to our technology, or general changes in economic conditions within their industries or geographic locations, we may experience delays in the development or delivery of products or services specified in customer contracts, or we may be unable to win competitive bid selection processes or achieve additional design wins on the timeline currently anticipated or at all. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that contracts, renewals or expected design wins included in strategic backlog will actually generate the specified revenues. Additionally, because strategic backlog estimates are operating metrics, the estimates are not required to be subject to the same level of internal review or controls as a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures. \n\n#indieSemi_Earnings \n\n**INDIE SEMICONDUCTOR, INC.** **PRELIMINARY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **(Amounts in thousands,

As set forth in the tables above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management may use these non-GAAP financial measures to, amongst other things, evaluate operating performance and compare it against past periods or against peer companies, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods and to determine payments under compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or improve management’s ability to forecast future periods. \n\nWe provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We further believe these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of (i) acquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses (including acquisition-related or other non-recurring professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) inventory cost realignments, (iv) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (v) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vi) share-based compensation, and (vii) income tax benefit (expenses). We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures. \n\nWe do not report a GAAP measure of gross profit or gross margin because certain costs related to contract revenues are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses, and not in cost of sales, as it is not practicable for us to bifurcate these expenses. We derive and reconcile non-GAAP gross profit from the most relevant GAAP financial measures by subtracting GAAP cost of sales, adjusted for acquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses and share-based compensation, from GAAP revenue. We calculate non-GAAP operating loss by excluding from GAAP operating loss, any (i) acquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses (including acquisition-related or other non-recurring professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) inventory cost realignments and (iv) share-based compensation. We calculate non-GAAP net loss by excluding from GAAP net income (loss), any (i) acquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses (including acquisition-related or non-recurring professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) inventory cost realignments, (iv) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (v) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vi) share-based compensation, and (vii) income tax benefit (expenses). We calculate non-GAAP EBITDA by excluding from GAAP net income (loss), any (i) acquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses (including acquisition-related or non-recurring professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) depreciation of fixed assets, (iv)inventory cost realignments, (v) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (vi) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vii) share-based compensation, and (viii) income tax benefit (expenses). We calculate non-GAAP share count by adding (i) weighted average Class A common stock, (ii) weighted average Class V common stock held by minority shareholders, which are exchangeable into Class A common stock, (iii) Escrow Shares and (iv) vested but unexercised options issued as part of the TeraXion acquisition. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net loss by non-GAAP share count. \n\nWe exclude the items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below: \n\nAcquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses - including such items as, when applicable, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, accounting impact to the cost of goods sold due to one-time inventory costing realignment with a specific supplier, acquisition-related professional fees and legal expenses and other professional fees that are non-recurring in nature because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred. \n\nAmortization expenses - related to the amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and certain license rights. \n\nDepreciation expenses - related to the depreciation expenses for all property and equipment on hand. \n\nInventory cost realignments - related to the supplier allocation premiums introduced during COVID that is currently incorporated in our inventory cost but have since been eliminated going forward. The impact of this premium is deemed non-recurring and therefore not considered by management in its evaluation of the ongoing performance of the business. \n\nShare-based compensation - related to the non-cash compensation expense associated with equity awards granted to our employees (including those granted in lieu of cash compensation) and employer tax related to employee stock transactions. These expenses are not considered by management in making operating decisions and such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations. \n\nRestructuring costs - related to the one-time expenses the Company incurs to reorganize its operations, which is primarily related to workforce reduction, facilities and other purchase commitment charges. \n\nGain (loss) from change in fair values - because these adjustments (1) are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) are not directly controlled by management, (3) do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized and (4) cannot make comparisons between peer company performance less reliable. \n\nNon-cash interest expense - related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs because (1) these expenses are not considered by management in making decision with respect to financing decisions, and (2) these generally reflect non-cash costs. \n\nIncome tax benefit (expense) - related to the estimated income tax benefit (expense) that does not result in a current period tax refunds (payments). \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a result of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. \n\nBeginning in Q4 2023, management added non-GAAP EBITDA, which removes non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may distort EBITDA, to the current non-GAAP financial measures. We will calculate non-GAAP EBITDA by excluding from GAAP net income (loss), any (i) acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses (including acquisition-related or other non-recurring professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) depreciation of property, plant and equipment, (iv) inventory cost realignments, (v) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (vi) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vii) share-based compensation, and (viii) income tax benefit (expenses). \n\nTo the extent our disclosures contain forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures, such as our forward-looking outlook for non-GAAP EBITDA, these measures are provided to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are generally unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking non-GAAP measures because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of such non-GAAP measures are difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control and, therefore, is not available without unreasonable efforts. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles, or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related and other non-recurring professional expenses, unanticipated settlements, gains, losses and impairments and other unanticipated items not reflective of ongoing operations. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107737798r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Media Inquiries** media@indiesemi.com  **Investor Relations** ir@indiesemi.com\n\nSource: indie Semiconductor\n\n[View All News](https://investors.indiesemi.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investors.indiesemi.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://investors.indiesemi.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n[+1 949-418-8637](tel:+1 949-418-8637) IR@indiesemi.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Forward-looking\nstatements may be identified by the use of words such as “future,” “growth,” “opportunity,” “well-positioned,” \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"seek,\" \"target,\" “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,”\n“estimate,” “plan,” “outlook,” “project,” “may,” “could,” and “should,” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical\nmatters. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, projected financial information; statements regarding future events and opportunities; our strategic backlog\ninformation; our product and technology roadmap; estimates and forecasts of other financial and performance metrics, including those metrics citing analyst consensus; projections of market\nopportunity and market share; as well as the timing and anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our\nmanagement and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our\ncontrol. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results included in such forward-looking statements.\nIn addition to the factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 and amended on March 20,\n2024 and in our other public reports filed with the SEC (including those identified under “Risk Factors” therein), the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of\nevents to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and\nvolatility in the credit and financial markets; the impacts of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; our reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourced supply chain and the\navailability of semiconductors and manufacturing capacity; competitive products and pricing pressures; our ability to win competitive bid selection processes and achieve additional design wins;\nthe impact of recent acquisitions made and any other acquisitions we may make, including our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and risks that the anticipated benefits of any\nacquisitions may not be fully realized or take longer to realize than expected; our ability to develop, market and gain acceptance for new and enhanced products and expand into new\ntechnologies and markets; trade restrictions and trade tensions; and political or economic instability in our target markets. We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. All\ninformation set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this presentation or in our other\npublic filings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nIndustry and Market Data\nIn this presentation, we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding the sectors in which we compete and other industry data. We obtained this information and statistics from third-\nparty sources, including reports by market research firms. Although we believe these sources are reliable, they have not independently verified the information and we do not guarantee its\naccuracy and completeness. We have supplemented this information where necessary with information from discussions with our customers and our own internal estimates, taking into account\npublicly available information about other industry participants and our management’s best view regarding information that is not publicly available.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nindie and the indie logo are our trademarks. This presentation also contains trademarks, service marks and trade names of third parties, which are the property of their respective owners. The\nuse or display of third parties’ trademarks, service marks, trade names or products in this presentation is not intended to, and does not imply, a relationship with indie, or an endorsement or\nsponsorship by or of indie.\n2\nDISCLAIMER\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains certain financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), including non-\nGAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, and non-GAAP operating margin as well as the strategic backlog information described below. We calculate\nnon-GAAP gross profit by subtracting GAAP cost of sales from GAAP revenues. Note, all costs incurred in relation to our contract revenues are expensed as incurred as research and\ndevelopment costs and are therefore not included in the computation of non-GAAP gross profit. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by GAAP\nrevenues. Our strategic backlog information included herein represents an estimate of the revenue we expect to recognize from product orders over the next ten years.\nWe believe that non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Management may use these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate operating performance and compare it against past\nperiods or against peer companies, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods and to determine payments under compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and other items that\nmanagement believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, analyze trends in ongoing operations or improve\nmanagement’s ability to forecast future periods. Strategic backlog information also helps management and investors understand our projections based on the very long lead time\nbetween design wins and sales in the automotive market.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable\nto each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully\nthe adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures in our most recent earnings release.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating\nperformance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a\nresult of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set\nof accounting rules or principles.\nThe estimate of our strategic backlog requires substantial judgment and is based on a number of assumptions, including management’s current assessment of customer and third-party\ncontracts that exist as of the date the estimate is made, as well as revenues from expected contract renewals and/or expected design wins, to the extent that we believe that recognition\nof the related revenue will be realizable within the next ten years. Although we believe the assumptions underlying our strategic backlog estimate are reasonable, they are not\nguarantees and we can give no assurance that we will be able to recognize the revenues reflected in the strategic backlog estimate. A number of factors could result in actual revenues\nbeing less than the amounts reflected in strategic backlog. Our customers or third-party partners may attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons,\nincluding mergers, changes in their financial condition, or general changes in economic conditions within their industries or geographic locations, we may experience delays in the\ndevelopment or delivery of products or services specified in customer contracts, or we may be unable to win competitive bid selection processes or achieve additional design wins on the\ntimeline currently anticipated or at all. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that contracts, renewals or expected design wins included in strategic backlog will actually generate the\nspecified revenue.\n3\nINDIE AT A GLANCE\nPure-play automotive semiconductor\ncompany developing technology supporting\nbest-in-class in-cabin user experience,\n(1)\naccelerating electrification and enabling the\npursuit of the uncrashable vehicle.\n4\n1 – Issued and pending\nTHE FASTEST GROWTH SEMICONDUCTOR SEGMENT\nAutomotive Semiconductor Segment:\n$131 billion TAM\n10% CAGR\n- Automotive segment growth per McKinsey (2024)\n5\n- TAM (2029) and CAGR (2022-2029) based upon S&P Global Mobility (2023)\nMEGATRENDS ARE DRIVING ELECTRONICS GROWTH…\nDriver Safety (ADAS) & Automation\n• Growth driven by safety regulation\nIn-cabin User Experience (UX)\n• Growth driven by Consumer demand for better UX\nElectrification\n• Growth driven by emissions regulation\n6\n…ACCELERATING VEHICLE SILICON CONTENT VALUE\nindie SAM and Silicon Content Growth Outpacing Vehicle Production\nAutomotive Semiconductor TAM ($B) indie Addressable Market ($B) Passenger Vehicle Production (Mu) Average Silicon Content / Vehicle ($)\n131\n64\n96 1400\n48 V\n92 23 E 1000\n90\n800\n67 35 17\nX\n12 24 U\n82\n19\n16\nS\nA\n12 16 D\n7 A\n2022 2025 2029 2022 2025 2029 2022 2025 2029 2022 2025 2029\n10% CAGR 9% CAGR 2% CAGR 8% CAGR\nNote: Silicon content for EV & Premium vehicles is 2~4x Average Content\n7\n- TAM (2029), CAGR (2022-2029) and indie SAM based upon S&P Global Mobility (2023) and indie analysis\nSTRATEGICALLY POSITIONED TO LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITY\n• Best-in-class mixed-signal system-on-chip solutions\n• Hardware and software co-optimization\n• World-leading innovation – 500+ patents(1)\n• Innovative Vision and Radar IP portfolio\n• Diverse, automotive-validated supply chain\n• ASSP & custom ASIC engagement models\n8\n1 – Issued and pending\nINDIE DIFFERENTIATION DRIVES OEM PENETRATION\nPre-eminent, Global OEM Customer Base\n• High segment entry barriers surpassed\n• Growing OEM design-in momentum\n• Field-proven, high volume SoC shipments\ns\nt n 400M+\ne\nm\np\ni\nh\nS\n210Mu\nC\no\nS\ne 105Mu\nv\ni t 63Mu\na 29Mu\nl\nu\nm\nu\nC\n2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 (YTD)\n+ Others\n9\nGLOBAL FOOTPRINT, LOCAL SUPPORT\nAliso Viejo, CA\nHeadquarters\n10\nCREATING AN AUTOMOTIVE POWERHOUSE\nOrganically and Inorganically Adding Leading Technologies\nc\ni\nn\na\ng\nr\no Multi-gig Photonics / Photonics /\nn\nI ADCs LiDAR Radar Radar Vision LiDAR\n20072007 2023\nc Auto PMIC High Speed Embedded DSP Vehicle Bus Sensor AEC-Q100 Wireless ISO26262 iND880\ni\nn\nComms systems Communications Interface Charging (class-leading ISP)\na\ng\nr Apple\nO\nCarPlay\n11\nCompany Proprietary and Confidential | 12\nINDUSTRY OUTPACING REVENUE & MARGIN GROWTH\nGrowth Drivers:\n• Radar & Vision program ramps\n• Strong Tier 1 and OEM validation\n• Improving product mix\n• Sole source at major OEMs\n1 Non-GAAP basis.
