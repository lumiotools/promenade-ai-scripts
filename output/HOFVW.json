We are focused on working to complete the capital stacks of our Gameday Bay Waterpark and Tapestry Hotel, continuing to grow the type of media and gaming content that we are producing and distributing, as well as delivering one-of-a-kind experiences that you would expect from a sports and entertainment company, as we continue to execute upon our strategy and work towards achieving our long-term financial goals.\"\n\n**Key Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Second quarter revenue was $4.7 million, a decrease of 23% compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the mix of events within Hall of Fame Village.\n  * Second quarter net loss attributable to shareholders was $15.8 million, compared to a net loss of $13.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily driven by increases in net interest and depreciation expenses, partially offset by lower operating expenses.\n  * Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $4.2 million, compared to a loss of $6.2 million in the same period in the prior year. The change was driven by lower operating expenses from event-related expenses and compensation-related expenses. See page 6 for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\n  * The Company finished its fiscal quarter with a cash balance of $6.4 million, including $5.0 million in restricted cash, compared to $6.9 million, including $4.2 million in restricted cash, as of March 31, 2024.\n  * The Company restructured $21.0 million of debt with City of Canton, Stark County Port Authority, and Stark Community Foundation by extending maturity dates and payment terms for five different loans.

Constellation has employed its Efficiency Made Easy® program over the course of the development on two other occasions allowing for infrastructure development that is designed to reduce energy consumption, creating a more sustainable footprint to advance energy efficiency throughout the resort.\n  * The Company was awarded a $9.8 million grant from the State of Ohio's One Time Strategic Community Investments in support of the development of the Hall of Fame Village. In addition, the Company received a $500 thousand grant from the Stark Community Foundation.\n\n\n\n**Key Business Highlights**\n\n  * Gold Summit Gaming announced its Gridiron Gateway Gaming tournament. The event held in July showcased many of the top 100 ranked players in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Ultimate from across the United States. Notable highlights included Cody Schwab, the world's #1 Melee player representing Nouns Esports, who triumphed in the Melee Singles event, and Stephen Schmidt of Cincinnati Fear, who emerged victorious in the Ultimate Singles event. Former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell also participated in the Ultimate Singles competition.\n  * Hall of Fame Village hosted Bert Kreischer's Fully Loaded Comedy Festival in June at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

Crawford went on to say, \"while we continue to build the necessary infrastructure to support revenue growth, we remain focused on maximizing every dollar spent. The results for the first quarter highlight a significant step towards strengthening expense management processes, which will allow the company to reach stabilization quicker. While the macro-environment remains uncertain, the Company continues to focus on investing to create unique experiences for our guests to enjoy and drive positive results for our shareholders\".\n\n**Key Financial Highlights**\n\n  * First quarter revenue was $4.2 million, an increase of 34% compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by continued operationalization of Hall of Fame Village through event and rental revenue.\n  * First quarter net loss attributable to shareholders was $14.9 million, compared to a net loss of $19.6 million in the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by decreased operating expenses and partially offset by increased interest expense.\n  * First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.9 million, compared to a loss of $10.9 million in the same period in the prior year. The change was driven by decreased operating expenses including compensation-related expenses and third-party services in conjunction with the prior year period including several non-recurring items. See page 6 for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\n  * The Company finished its fiscal quarter with a cash balance of $6.9 million, including $4.2 million in restricted cash, compared to $11.8 million, including $8.6 million in restricted cash, as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Business Highlights**\n\n  * Hall of Fame Village hosted many large events including events in the Center for Performance ranging from the ForeverLawn Faith Leadership Event with headline speakers Craig Groeschel and Tim Tebow, conventions and trade shows, and sporting leagues and cheerleading events. The variety and type of events and subsequent increased attendance has allowed us to benefit from our synergistic revenue model.\n  * Opened several new tenants within Hall of Fame Village with Driven Elite Fitness facility located within the Constellation Center for Excellence and Driven Elite Performance situated in the Center for Performance along with Heggy's Nut Shop, a beloved brand renowned throughout Stark County for its premier-quality snacks.\n  * The Company finalized an audit of campus wide operating systems with plans to implement this year, which will enhance revenue maximization, improve operational efficiencies, all with a focus on creating a world class visitor experience.\n  * The Company has accelerated its expense management processes, which have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to date. The continued investments in the processes will allow for the Company to reach stabilization more quickly.\n  * Hall of Fame Village has announced numerous large events and has curated an exciting full year calendar of entertainment and engagement options. These events range from eight-time Grammy Award winner Carrie Underwood performing at the Concert for Legends in August during the annual weeklong Enshrinement Festival to Bert Kreischer's _Fully Loaded Comedy Festival_ in June and GridIron Gateway Gaming Tournament in July. Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium will also be the home for the _Opendorse Bowl Series_ featuring four Division III conferences this winter.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call** The Company will host a conference call and webcast Tuesday, May 14, 2024, beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET, to provide commentary on the business.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as additions to, and not as alternatives for the Company's results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP measures the Company uses may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and other companies may not define the non-GAAP measures the company uses in the same way.\n\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation**  \nNet loss attributable to HOFRE stockholders | $ (14,887,588) | $ (19,609,797)  \n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes | - | -  \nInterest expense, net | 6,521,534 | 3,632,637  \nDepreciation expense | 4,158,750 | 2,553,360  \nAmortization of discount on note payable | 955,322 | 855,891  \nEBITDA | (3,251,982) | (12,567,909)  \nImpairment expense | - | 1,145,000  \nChange in fair value of warrant liability | (49,000) | 238,000  \nChange in fair value of interest rate swap | - | 100,000  \nLoss on sale of asset | 140,041 | -  \nIncome from equity method investments | (29,952) | -  \nPreferred stock dividends | 266,000 | 266,000  \nLoss attributable to non-controlling interest | (8,588) | (48,577)  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ (2,933,481) | $ (10,867,486)  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL12879&sd=2024-05-13) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hall-of-fame-resort--entertainment-company-announces-first-quarter-2024-results-302143947.html>\n\nSOURCE Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n[Directions](https://www.hofreco.com/directions.aspx) [Contact](https://www.hofreco.com/contact.aspx) [Site Map](https://www.hofreco.com/sitemap.aspx) [Privacy, Terms & Cookies](https://www.hofreco.com/privacy-terms-cookies)\n"
