(Nasdaq: “NCNC”), and DG Capital Group (“DGCG”) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly develop innovative decarbonization solutions for corporations and communities aiming to reduce carbon emissions and achieve green transition goals. \n\nThis collaboration unites noco-noco’s revolutionary battery technology, designed to extend battery lifespan and enhance durability, with DGCG’s advanced Digital Grid-Forming Inverter System (DGR), which is integral to supporting renewable energy infrastructures. Together, they will aim to offer sustainable, resilient energy solutions by combining high-efficiency, highly reliable technologies to support the energy transition both in Japan and globally. \n\n**Powering Decarbonization with Advanced Technologies**\n\nThe MOU formalizes a partnership between noco-noco and DGCG, focused on overcoming energy transition challenges such as stable energy supply, effective energy storage, and long-term carbon neutrality. By integrating DGCG’s DGR System with noco-noco’s high-performance battery technology, the companies will develop energy solutions independent of conventional infrastructures to enable reliable renewable energy utilization. \n\n**Collaborative Technology and Business Development Initiatives**\n\nUnder the terms of the MOU, the companies plan to collaborate in the following areas: \n\n  1. Technology Development \n\n\n  * DGCG will incorporate noco-noco’s battery technology, known for its extended lifespan and high-temperature resilience, into its DGR System to create an enhanced grid-forming solution. This advanced solution will be jointly developed, and will leverage the strengths of both technologies to achieve higher performance standards. \n\n\n  1. Business Development \n\n\n  * Leveraging their combined networks, DGCG and noco-noco will seek to expand market opportunities for their enhanced DGR System. Target markets include remote islands, weak-grid regions (areas where electricity infrastructure is unstable), industrial complexes, and semiconductor plants, both within Japan and abroad. \n\n\n  * The two companies plan to establish a joint venture to pursue business partnerships and develop microgrids or grid-scale energy storage solutions, with earnings generated through these ventures to be shared between both parties. \n\n\n\n**Mid-term collaboration timeline**\n\n  * 2024: Formulation of the technology development roadmap and business plan \n\n\n  * 2025-2026: Execution of technology and business development, and preparation for establishing the joint venture. \n\n\n  * From 2026: Utilizing DGCG and noco-noco’s market networks to expand sales and deployment of the enhanced DGR System in target regions. \n\n\n\nMasataka Matsumura, CEO of noco-noco Inc., commented: “We are thrilled to collaborate with DG Capital Group in creating innovative decarbonization solutions that align with our vision for carbon-neutrality and sustainable energy. We believe there are significant synergies between our battery technology and the cutting-edge DGR grid forming inverter system, and this collaboration marks an important step in increasing our competitiveness in the commercial and grid-scale energy storage solution sector, as we have outlined in our 2025 restart plan.” \n\n**About noco-noco:** noco-noco Inc.

(the “Company”) announces that it has sought an extension to effect its reverse stock split in order to comply with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement, following a delay that prevented the reverse split from taking place, by the previously set deadline of November 1, 2024.\n\nAt the Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) held on October 17, 2024, the Company’s shareholders approved a share consolidation (reverse stock split) and the adoption of an Amended Memorandum & Articles of Association (“MAA”), both intended to take effect immediately. However, due to the timing of the required filings, the reverse split was delayed. Specifically, the Company did not submit the Company Event Notification Form to Nasdaq five business days prior to the planned effective date. This delay arose because of the issuance of consideration shares to noco-tech, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3DOM Alliance Inc., as part of the Company's broader compliance strategy regarding the shareholders' equity requirement. The transfer agent required more time than expected to process these updates to the shareholder register.\n\nDue to this delay, the Company will need to postpone the effective date of the share consolidation. Under Cayman Islands law, changes such as share consolidation and amendments to the MAA require shareholder approval. As the Company was unable to implement the share consolidation on the previously approved date, it will seek shareholder ratification for the revised effective date at an upcoming EGM, anticipated on December 13, 2024, with the reverse stock split expected to be implemented approximately December 20, 2024.\n\nIn connection with its actions to comply with the $2.5 million minimum stockholders’ equity requirement in accordance with the Panel’s decision dated August 25, 2024, the Company closed the acquisition of separator production facilities from noco-tech Inc. for approximately $9 million, via a new issuance of 90,433,183 restricted ordinary shares of the Company at a reference price of $0.10 per share, with such shares to be issued as full and final consideration for the assets. The successful transaction closing has significantly improved the shareholder equity deficit position of $7.3 million as of June 30, 2024 (unaudited) to a positive position of $1.7 million.\n\nThe Company remains committed to regaining compliance with Nasdaq’s listing standards and will continue to update shareholders on further developments.\n\n**About noco-noco:** noco-noco Inc.
