Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the\nTSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $5.1 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $6.9\nmillion for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 (2023 - $6.9 million net loss and negative operating cash flows\nof $11.3 million). At June 30, 2024, we had $0.3 million in working capital (September 30, 2023 – $0.5 million)\nand $40.3 million in deficit (September 30, 2023 – $35.2 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms; and\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the global\ndisruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the\ncarrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if\nthe going concern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”) and the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee. They do not include all the information\nrequired for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements for the\nyear ended September 30, 2023. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and\ntransactions that are material to an understanding of the changes in our financial position and performance since\nthe last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on August 14, 2024.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt June 30, 2024, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value\nof the consideration given in exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most material effects on the\namounts recognized in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as\ndisclosed in Note 2(f) of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at June 30, 2024, that have a material risk of resulting\nin a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are the same\nas disclosed in Note 2(f) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\n3.

As part of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we have issued 3,226,392 warrants\n(the “2022 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share. Additionally, the U.S. underwriter exercised\nits over-allotment option to purchase:\n• 199,000 Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.01 per share for $3.81024 per pre-funded\nwarrant (net of underwriter discount);\n• 375,000 warrants with exercise price of US$5.00 per share for $0.0001 per warrant;\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nIn accordance with IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant\nliabilities”) because the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional\ncurrency (Canadian dollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise\nof the above securities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at\nFVTPL (see Note 3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023).\nGains on revaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 11(a)).\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2022.\nAt June 30,2024, the fair value of the warrants was remeasured using the following assumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Warrants Pre-Funded Over-allotment\n(1) Warrants Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 - 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.03 $ - $ 0.03\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.3687 $ - $ -\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.04 $ - $ 0.04\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on June 28, 2024, for the warrants.\nWe recognized a gain of $678,172 and $1,325,820 in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three and nine\nmonths ended June 30,2024, respectively, which was reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated net loss\nand comprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we had entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 11(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\n13\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt June 30 2024, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price on June\n28, 2024, of US$0.0265. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $7,092\nand $16,104 for the three and nine months ended June, 30, 2024, respectively, which was reported in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nPrivate Placement (July 2023)\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed an underwritten U.S. private placement for gross proceeds of CAD$7.4 million\n(US$5.59 million) (see Note 11(a)). As part of the private placement, we have issued 1,542,194 warrants (the\n“2023 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$2.66 per share. Additionally, 930,548 pre-funded Warrants with\nan exercise price of US$0.001 per share for US$2.259 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the private placement.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023).

In this offering, 803,500 pre-funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.001 per\nshare for US$0.649 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the offering.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars).

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant. The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All these warrants\nexpire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit.

This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities was reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive\nloss.\nDebt Settlement (December 2022)\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval.

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the\nTSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $3.9 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $5.0\nmillion for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $3.4 million net loss and negative operating cash flows\nof $9.2 million). At March 31, 2024, we had negative $2.2 million in working capital (September 30, 2023 –\n$0.5 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the global\ndisruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on May 14, 2024.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt March 31, 2024, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are the same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at March 31, 2024, that have a significant risk of\nresulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are\nthe same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September\n30, 2023.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the six months ended March 31, 2024, the accounting policies in these condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated financial statements as at and for\nthe year ended September 30, 2023.\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n4.

Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023). Gains on\nrevaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 11(a)).\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAt March 31, 2024, we remeasured the fair value of these warrants using the following assumptions:\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOver-allotment\n2022 Warrants Pre-Funded Over-allotment\n(1) Warrants (2) Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.12 $ 1.24 $ 0.12\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.355 $ 1.355 $ 1.355\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.16 $ 1.67 $ 0.16\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on March 28, 2024, for the warrants.\n(2) Fair value is measured at the Nasdaq closing price on March 28, 2024, for the underlying common stock less US$0.01 exercise price.\nWe recognized a loss of $1,044 and a gain of $647,648 in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three and\nsix months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and\ncomprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 11(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\nAt March 31, 2024, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price on\nMarch 28, 2024, of US$0.12. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1,252\nand $9,012 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, which was reported in the condensed\nconsolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed an underwritten U.S. private placement for gross proceeds of CAD$7.4 million\n(US$5.59 million) (see Note 11(a)). As part of the private placement, we have issued 1,542,194 warrants (the\n“2023 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$2.66 per share. Additionally, 930,548 pre-funded Warrants with\nan exercise price of US$0.001 per share for US$2.259 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the private placement.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars).

Accordingly, at inception, the 2023 Warrants were measured at fair value using the Black\nScholes option pricing model (Level 2).

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant. The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All these warrants\nexpire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire in five years on December 9, 2027.\nEffective May 1, 2023, the warrants are listed on the TSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$19.4 million\n(USD $14.1 million), before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAccounting Treatment\nRefer to Note 10 for the accounting of the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of US$835,000 (or CAD$1,138,105) equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the\nU.S. Offering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “U.S. Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950\ncommon shares equal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under\nthe U.S. Offering. Each U.S. Underwriter Warrant is exercisable to acquire one common share at a price of\nUS$5.1625, exercisable as of June 4, 2023, and expiring on December 9, 2027.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the Canadian Offering, PI Financial received: (a)\na cash commission of approximately US$210,000 (or CAD$286,230); and (b) 50,848 compensation options (the\n15\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n“Canadian Compensation Options”). Each Canadian Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one\nCanadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 and expiring on December 9, 2024.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.1 million share offering costs (or\nCAD$2.8 million) for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which CAD$628,262 was incurred and deferred\nat September 30, 2022.\nThe total brokers compensation (including fair value of U.S. Underwriter Warrants and Canadian Compensation\nOptions) and share offering costs was US$3.2 million (or CAD$4.4 million). This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 (or CAD$302,197) of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest\nand 10% premium at maturity (the “Debt Settlements”). The terms of the Units are the same as the Units issued\nin the Canadian Offering.\nOn January 10, 2024, we issued 46,709 common shares in a settlement of debt in an amount of approximately\n$97,615. The debt resulted in a trail obligation relating to services rendered by a third-party consultant, which\nthe Company has elected to pay in common shares. The common shares issued pursuant to the Debt Settlement\n(signed October 31, 2023) are subject to a four-month hold period pursuant to applicable securities legislation\nand the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares\nof KWESST, for aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023\nOffering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26\n(CAD$2.98) per common share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of\nUS$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-funded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and\nPre-funded Warrant being bundled with one common share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common\nWarrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of\nUS$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is immediately exercisable and entitles the holder to\nacquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per Common Share for a period of 60\nmonths following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares and Pre-funded Warrants\nare each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nThinkEquity acted as sole placement agent for the Offering. As compensation for services rendered, the\nCompany paid to ThinkEquity a cash fee of $475,013.14 representing 8.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds of\nthe Offering and issued 123,637 warrants to purchase a number of Common Shares (the \"Placement Agent\nWarrants\"), representing 5% of the Common Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Offering. The\nPlacement Agent Warrants will be exercisable, in whole or in part, immediately upon issuance and will expire\n60 months after the closing date of the Offering at an initial exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per Common\nShare.\n16\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nb) Warrants\nThe following is a summary of changes in outstanding warrants since September 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nNumber of average\nwarrants exercise price\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 15,507,862 $ 2 .49\nExercised (385,716) -\nExpired (5,520,000) (0.12)\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 9,602,146 $ 2 .37\nExercisable at March 31, 2024 8,672,008 $ 2 .50\nThe table below outlines the ratio upon which the above warrants are converted into common shares.\nU.S. Underwriter Warrants\nIn the U.S. IPO, we issued 134,950 warrants (“U.S. Underwriter Warrants”).

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the TSX-\nV under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $0.4 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $2.9\nmillion for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (2022 - $2.2 million net loss and negative operating cash\nflows of $6.6 million). At December 31, 2023, we had $0.4 million in working capital (December 31, 2022 –\n$3.0 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the global\ndisruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on February 14, 2024.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2023, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

As part of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we have issued 3,226,392 warrants (the\n“2022 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share. Additionally, the U.S. underwriter exercised its\nover-allotment option to purchase:\n• 199,000 Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.01 per share for $3.81024 per pre-funded\nwarrant (net of underwriter discount);\n• 375,000 warrants with exercise price of US$5.00 per share for $0.0001 per warrant;\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023). Gains on\nrevaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 11(a)).\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAt December 31, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of these warrants using the following assumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants (1) Warrants (2) Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.14 $ 0.89 $ 0.14\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.323 $ 1.323 $ 1.323\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.18 $ 1.16 $ 0.18\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on December 31, 2023, for the warrants.\n(2) Fair value is measured at the Nasdaq closing price on December 31, 2023, for the underlying common stock less US$0.01 exercise price.\nWe recognized $648,692 as a gain in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended December\n31, 2023, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 11(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\nAt December 31, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price\non December 29, 2023, of US$0.14. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities\nof $4,726 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net\nloss and comprehensive loss.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed an underwritten U.S. private placement for gross proceeds of CAD$7.4 million\n(US$5.59 million) (see Note 11(a)). As part of the private placement, we have issued 1,542,194 warrants (the\n“2023 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$2.66 per share. Additionally, 930,548 pre-funded Warrants with\nan exercise price of US$0.001 per share for US$2.259 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the private placement.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars).

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant. The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All these warrants\nexpire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire in five years on December 9, 2027.\nEffective May 1, 2023, the warrants are listed on the TSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$19.4 million\n(USD $14.1 million), before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAccounting Treatment\nRefer to Note 10 for the accounting of the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of US$835,000 (or CAD$1,138,105) equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the\nU.S. Offering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “U.S. Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950\ncommon shares equal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under\n15\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nthe U.S. Offering.

Each Canadian Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one\nCanadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 and expiring on December 9, 2024.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.1 million share offering costs (or\nCAD$2.8 million) for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which CAD$628,262 was incurred and deferred\nat September 30, 2022.\nThe total brokers compensation (including fair value of U.S. Underwriter Warrants and Canadian Compensation\nOptions) and share offering costs was US$3.2 million (or CAD$4.4 million). This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities were expensed during the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 (or CAD$302,197) of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest\nand 10% premium at maturity (the “Debt Settlements”). The terms of the Units are the same as the Units issued\nin the Canadian Offering.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares\nof KWESST, for aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023\nOffering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26\n(CAD$2.98) per common share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of\nUS$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-funded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and\nPre-funded Warrant being bundled with one common share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common\nWarrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of\nUS$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is immediately exercisable and entitles the holder to\nacquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per Common Share for a period of 60\nmonths following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares and Pre-funded Warrants\nare each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nThinkEquity acted as sole placement agent for the Offering.

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of August 14, 2024.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2024 (“Q3 Fiscal 2024 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q3 Fiscal 2024 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent\nupon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise additional\n2 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\ndebt or equity financing, when required.

Q3 and YTD Fiscal 2024\nEBITDA loss was $0.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, a decrease of 75% and 30%, respectively over the comparable\nprior period mainly due to an increase in revenue and gross profits from our digitization contracts combined with a decrease\nin operating expenses mainly due to a reduction in consulting fees and investor relations costs over the three-month period\nend, and a decrease in share issuance costs over the nine-month period end. The adjustments to EBITDA loss for Q3 and\nYTD Fiscal 2024 included the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Due to the lower volume of stock-based grants in\nthe last 12 months, compared to same prior period, there is a reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the YTD\nFiscal 2024 period compared to YTD Fiscal 2023. There were share issuance costs in Q3 2024 relating to two US public\nofferings whereas no financing activities occurred in the comparable quarter Fiscal 2023. The lower share issuance costs\nYTD Fiscal 2024 over the comparable prior period is mainly due to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in Fiscal 2023 YTD.\nThe decrease in net financing costs YTD Fiscal 2024 over the comparable prior period is due to the costs related to the\nunsecured loans in Fiscal 2023 whereas the loans were repaid, and no such costs were incurred YTD Fiscal 2024.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased by $0.2 million in the third quarter compared to Q3 Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.2\nmillion generated from our digitization business line, offset by a negligible reduction from our non-lethal business line (driven\nfrom the sale of ARWEN products).\nTotal revenue increased by $0.3 million in YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to YTD Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.3\nmillion generated from our digitization business line. At the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024, we had sales from our\nnon-lethal business line (driven from the sale of ARWEN products) of $280K, a decrease of $21K from the comparable prior\nperiod.\nWe expect revenue to increase with the commercial launch of KWESST LightningTM which we expect to be early in calendar\n2025, with the expected demand/future orders for the new ARWEN 40mm ammunition and PARA OPS products, as well as\nfrom the recently announced LC4ISR (“Land command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and\nreconnaissance”) subcontract. Management continues to work with our industry partners to determine the outlook for ramp-\nup on the DSEF program. The Company continues to expect no material impact to the overall potential revenue over the life\nof the contract.\nGross Profit\nIn Q3 Fiscal 2024, similar to the same period in Fiscal 2023, the gross profit was negligible. For YTD Fiscal 2024, we earned\n$0.2 million or gross margin of 24.3%, compared to $0.2 million or gross margin of 39.3% in the same period in 2023.\nIn Fiscal 2024, indirect costs associated with the ramp up of the Canadian Government contracts in Q1 resulted in lower gross\nmargin as compared to the same period in 2023. We expect gross profit / margin to continue to increase during Fiscal 2024\nfrom the other product lines described above as well as continued ramp up on the Canadian Government contracts.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX decreased by $0.8 million from the comparable prior period in the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to the\nfollowing factors:\n• S&M decreased by $0.5 million, primarily due to a decrease in investor relations costs and related sales and\nmarketing costs ($0.4 million) in Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023;\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\n• G&A decreased by $0.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and general office expenses, offset\nby an increase in senior management and directors compensation due to market adjustments and additional personnel\nas compared to Fiscal 2023; offset by\n• R&D increased by $0.1 million, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs advancing the KWESST LightningTM\nand BLDS projects in Fiscal 2024.\nTotal OPEX was $7.9 million for YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to $7.8 million in YTD Fiscal 2023, an increase of $ 0.2 million\nover the comparable prior year due to the following factors:\n• R&D increased by $0.8 million, primarily due to the fact that the LEC has reached commercial feasibility, and any\nassociated costs are no longer being capitalized, while it was still in the development stage in Fiscal 2023 ($0.5\nmillion), coupled with an increase in personnel costs advancing the KWESST LightningTM and BLDS projects in\nFiscal 2024 ($0.7 million), offset by a reduction in consulting fees compared to the comparable prior year period\n($0.3 million);\n• G&A increased by $0.4 million, primarily due to the amortization of the LEC intangible in Fiscal 2024 ($0.4\nmillion), an increase in senior management and directors compensation to be in line with market and additional\npersonnel as compared to Fiscal 2023 ($0.3 million), offset by a reduction in consulting & professional fees\ncompared to the comparable prior year period ($0.2 million); offset by\n• S&M decreased by $1.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in investor relations costs and related sales and\nmarketing costs ($1.0 million), and a decrease in business development costs ($0.2 million).\nOther income (expenses), net\nFor Q3 Fiscal 2024, our total other income was $1.0 million, compared to total other expenses of $0.5 million in Q3 Fiscal\n2023. This change in other income (expenses) net is mainly due to the favorable $2.0 million change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant liabilities at June 30, 2024, driven by a decrease in the underlying\ncommon share price on June 30, 2024, offset by a $0.4 million increase in share issuance costs associated with the two US\npublic offering financing activities in Q3 Fiscal 2024.\nFor YTD 2024, our total other income was $2.5 million, compared to total other income of $0.7 million for the same period\n2023 resulting in an increase of $1.8 million. The change in other income (expenses) was driven mainly by:\n• $0.3 million favorable change in fair value of warrant liabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant\nliabilities at June 30, 2024, driven by a decrease in the underlying common share price on June 30, 2024. Under\nIFRS, we are required to remeasure the warrant liabilities at each reporting date until they are exercised or expired;\n• A decrease of $0.9 million in Share Offering Costs as $1.3 million related to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in\nFiscal 2023, compared to $0.4 million associated with the two US public offering financing activities in April and\nJune 2024;\n• $0.5 million decrease in net finance costs is primarily due to the Fiscal 2023 recognition of the remaining\nunamortized accretion costs and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the\nclosing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering; and\n• $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange gain due to appreciation in the U.S. currency during the period.\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to June 30, 2024 (unaudited):\n2024 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4\nRevenue 3 29 486 129 606 150 161 317 255\nNet loss ( 1,162) ( 3,540) ( 399) ( 2,419) ( 3,452) ( 1,227) ( 2,208) ( 2,345)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2024 due to uncertain magnitude and timeline\nof ramp up on our military government contracts as well as ramp of revenue for new Arwen and PARA OPS products.\nAdditionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the remeasurement of warrant liabilities at each\nreporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2 ,670,123 $ 6 ,842,074\nNon-current 4 ,071,537 4 ,916,758\nTotal assets $ 6,741,660 $ 1 1,758,832\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 2,325,864 $ 6 ,383,635\nNon-current 1 ,269,121 1 ,439,577\nTotal liabilities 3 ,594,985 7 ,823,212\nNet assets $ 3,146,675 $ 3 ,935,620\nWorking capital (1) $ 344,259 $ 4 58,439\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $0.3 million at June 30, 2024, a $0.1 million decrease from September 30, 2023. The decrease was\nprimarily due to the net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2024, offset by proceeds from two financing activities in the current\nquarter of Fiscal 2024. Current liabilities include warrant liabilities, a non-cash liability item (see Note 10 of the Q3 Fiscal\n2024 financial statements). Excluding warrant liabilities, we would have working capital of $0.6 million. These warrant\nliabilities will be extinguished when the warrants are exercised or expired. If exercised, the proceeds will provide us with\nadditional capital to fund our future working capital requirements. There is no assurance that any warrants will be exercised.\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nTotal assets decreased by $5.0 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in cash of $4.2 million and a\ndecrease in the unamortized value of non-current assets of $0.8 million.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $4.2 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due a decrease in the warrant liabilities of $4.0\nmillion, a $0.1 million decrease in trade payables and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments to suppliers, and a\n$0.1 million decrease in existing lease obligations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross\nproceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A\ndated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected use of proceeds). On July 21, 2023, we closed the Private\nPlacement pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5.59 million (or CAD$7.4 million), before\nunderwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected\nuse of proceeds). On April 9, 2024, we closed a US Public Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds\nof USD$1.0 million (or CAD$1.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs. On June 14, 2024, we closed a US Public\nOffering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$1.7 million (or CAD$2.3 million), before\nunderwriting and offering costs\nAt June 30, 2024, our cash position was $1.2 million, a decrease of $4.2 million since September 30, 2023 primarily due to\ncash used in operations of $6.9 million, offset by net proceeds of $2.6 million from two US Public Offering financing activities\nin April 2024 and June 2024, respectively.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our other products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business\nis dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise\nadditional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting our future financial\nposition and our performance. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to implement our business\nplan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial performance. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential sources of capital may\ninclude additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other\nthings, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new\ncustomer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event we raise\nadditional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional\nincurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and\nfinancial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or\nat all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance\nour commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\n12 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nNine months ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nCash inflows (outflows) by activity:\nOperting activities $ (6,876,278) $ ( 11,346,319)\nInvesting activities (95,285) (990,463)\nFinancing acitivities 2 ,743,433 1 3,925,926\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ (4,228,130) $ 1 ,589,143\nCash, beginning of period 5 ,407,009 170,545\nCash, end of period $ 1,178,879 $ 1,759,688\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities decreased by $4.5 million to $6.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024\nprimarily due to payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting fees, and bonuses in\nFiscal 2023 after the close of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in December 2022, coupled with significant prepaid\nexpenses during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 including retention bonus for our general manager of PARA OPS\n(refundable in the event he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us), compared to regular operating\nactivities in Fiscal 2024, with no significant transactions.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities decreased by $0.9 million to $0.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024\nmainly due to the Fiscal 2023 additional investment in the product development of our PARA OPS, coupled with additional\nlow-rate initial production equipment for PARA OPS, whereas there were no significant investments in equipment in Fiscal\n2024.\nCash (used) provided by financing activities\nCash flow used by financing activities was less than $2.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 mainly from the\nnet proceeds received from two US Public Offering financing activities in Fiscal 2024, compared to cash flow provided by\nfinancing activities of $13.9 million in Fiscal 2023 primarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S. IPO and Canadian\nOffering, partially offset by repayment of all outstanding borrowings during the Fiscal 2023 period to date.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million units at a public offering price of US$4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. All these warrants will expire on December 8, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of US$4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per Common Share exercise price of\nUS$5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of US$14.1 million (CAD $19.4\nmillion).

Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder\nto acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is\nimmediately exercisable and entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50)\nper Common Share for a period of 60 months following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares\nand Pre-funded Warrants are each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately.

In connection with the closing, the Company will pay a cash fee\nequal to 7.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised the placement agent as well as issue warrants to purchase up to an\naggregate of 353,625 common shares (equal to 7.5% of common shares issued) at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, which\nwarrants are exercisable upon issuance and have a termination date of August 9, 2029. The registered direct offering was\nclosed on August 13, 2024.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim Filings and Rule 13a-\n15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, we have evaluated, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our management, including out Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the design\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nas of the end of the quarter. These DC&P are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\npublicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.\nBased upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level due to the\nmaterial weaknesses described below under “Management’s Assessment on Internal controls over Financial Reporting”. As\na result of the material weaknesses identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures.\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at June 30, 2024 in conformance with IFRS.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings and as\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), The Company’s\nmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, and designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”) to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”)\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent\nlimitations. ICFR is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgement and\nbreakdowns resulting from human failures. ICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.\nBecause of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by\nICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to\ndesign into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs at June 30, 2024, management assessed the design of our ICFR and concluded that our ICFR includes material weaknesses,\ndescribed below. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in interim or annual\nfinancial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To compensate for this material weakness,\nmanagement continues to perform additional account reconciliations and other analytical and substantive procedures to ensure\nreliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The material weakness will\nnot be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has\nconcluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nManagement, under the supervision, and with the participation, of our CEO and CFO and oversight of the Board of Directors,\nevaluated the effectiveness of our ICFR as at September 30, 2023 and evaluated the design at June 30, 2024 against the COSO\n17 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nFramework. Based on these evaluations, Management concluded that material weaknesses existed as of June 30, 2024, as\ndescribed below, and due to these material weaknesses, ICFR is not effective as of June 30, 2024.\nIneffective control environment: The Company did not have an effective control environment due to the lack of a\nsufficient complement of fully trained personnel in financial reporting, accounting and IT with assigned\nresponsibility and accountability related to ICFR. This material weakness contributed to the other material\nweaknesses below.\nSpreadsheet Controls: The Company did not implement and maintain effective controls surrounding certain\nspreadsheets. Spreadsheets are inherently prone to error due to the manual nature, which increases the risk of human\nerror. The Company’s controls related to complex spreadsheets did not address all identified risks associated with\nmanual data entry, review of inputs into management assumptions and estimates, completeness of data entry, and\nthe accuracy of mathematical formulas, impacting complex spreadsheets used in revenue, inventory, impairment\nand financial closing processes.\nIT General Controls: The Company had an aggregation of deficiencies within its IT general controls across multiple\nsystems, including deficiencies related to segregation of duties, user access and change management. As a result,\nthe Company concluded that its process-level automated and manual controls in the areas of journal entries and\nfinancial reporting that are dependent on IT general controls, information, and data derived from affected IT systems\nwere also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nManagement Review Controls: The Company did not consistently have documented evidence of management\nreview controls and did not always maintain segregation of duties between preparing and reviewing analyses and\nreconciliations with respect to revenue, inventory, purchasing, and financial closing.\nChanges to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2023 and Q3 2024 to date, the Company underwent a series of changes that materially affected areas reasonably\nlikely to continue to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management has\ncontinued efforts to develop and enhance the performance of ICFR. The addition of additional qualified finance and HR staff\nas well as the appointment of its CFO and CEO who are both experienced and qualified CPAs, will have a positive effect on\nthe Company’s ability to remediate its internal control deficiencies.\nRemediation Plan\nLate in the second half of fiscal year 2023, and subsequent to the fiscal year-end 2023, the Company strengthened its ability\nto remediate the above noted material weaknesses with the addition of:\n- Additional qualified finance and HR staff;\n- Addition of qualified CPAs in both the CFO and CEO roles;\n- Engagement of an external IT consultant and reorganizing accountability for IT general controls within the Company’s\nmanagement team with a qualified internal leader.\nThese measures have made improvements to the deficiencies that aggregate to form the material weaknesses identified above.\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the\nidentified material weaknesses with a focus on enhancing business processes and controls as the Company continues to\nmature. Management will additionally:\n- Review its IT strategy and investigating ways to improve key software applications.\n- Review key business processes and controls to determine where further system reliance can potentially mitigate the use\nof complex spreadsheets, improve segregation of duties, and reduce reliance on manual management review controls.\n18 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\n- Improve control tools and templates to aide with the sufficient and consistent documentation of review controls and\nprocedures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described\nabove.\n19 | P age"

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of May 14, 2024.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and six months ended March 31, 2024 (“Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent\nupon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise additional\n2 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\ndebt or equity financing, when required.

At Fiscal Year-End 2023, we began to group our offerings for\ncommercialization purposes into Military and Public Safety missions, as shown on our web site at www.kwesst.com\nKWESST’s Military offerings are comprised of:\n5 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n Digitization: real-time data sharing at the tactical level, including integration with Battlefield Management\nApplications (BMS) including ATAK and TAK.\n Digitized firing platforms (“Digital Fires” or “Joint Fires”).\n Battlefield Laser Detection Systems (“BLDS”).\n Digitized Electro Magnetic Spectrum Operations (“EMSO”).\nKWESST’s Public Safety offerings are comprised of:\n KWESST Lightning: leverages the Company’s military digitization technology to provide responders to any type\nof incident with instant onboarding to the mission and TAK-enabled real-time situational awareness software as a\nservice (SaaS).\n Non-Lethal Munitions Systems\nPARA OPSTM, a next-generation non-lethal system just being introduced to market now.\no\nARWENTM 37mm system, plus a new 40mm munition.\no\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to pursue and win large defense contracts for multi-year revenue visibility with prime defense contractors for\nnext-generation situational awareness, with a particular focus on ATAK applications that can be leveraged to address similar\nrequirements in the Public Safety Market complemented by our proprietary ARWEN and PARA OPSTM non-lethal products,\nwhere it is possible to drive sales and where the sales cycle is typically shorter than the more programmatic defense market.\nMajor Highlights – Quarter ended March 31, 2024 (“Q2 Fiscal 2024”)\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred during the quarter ended Q2 Fiscal 2024:\n• On February 2, we announced that Dave Ibbetson, former General Manager of General Dynamics C4 Systems\nInternational, and General Dynamics Mission Systems International (“GDMS”) has been engaged as a Strategic\nDefence Advisor.\n• On February 5, we announced highlights from the Company’s attendance at SHOT Show 2024. This included\nmany law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local level, plus foreign distributors from Europe, Asia,\nLatin America and the Middle East, specifically seeking out the Company to view the new products. The Company\nhas started receiving initial small quantity orders for test and evaluation of its 40mm baton ammunition as well as\nrequests from various agencies for live demonstrations of the PARA OPSTM products.\n• On February 12, we announced that we were invited to demonstrate and brief on our public safety products at an\ninternational gathering of special intervention units, which was held overseas in April 2024. We have also been\ndemonstrating and briefing on our new PARA OPS non-lethal system, our new 40mm ARWEN cartridge for riot\ncontrol and tactical teams and our new Lightning and T-SAS systems for sharing situational awareness among\nresponders and commanders to various police agencies in North America.\n6 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n• On February 28, we announced the signing of a binding letter of intent with O’Dell Engineering Ltd., in\nSouthwestern Ontario, Canada, for the sale and distribution of PARA OPS products in Canada for the civilian\nmarket.\n• On March 8, we announced that the Company has been awarded a contract by the Ontario Provincial Police (\"OPP\")\nto deliver training and certification to the force's lead Team Awareness Kit (TAK) users and trainers.\n• On March 12, we reported on the Company’s demonstrations of PARA OPSTM to Southern California law\nenforcement agencies at their request following demonstrations at SHOT Show 2024 in Las Vegas in January.\nThe following is a summary of major highlights that occurred since Q2 Fiscal 2024:\n• On April 3, we announced that the Company intends to offer to sell common shares (and/or pre-funded warrants\n(\"Pre-funded Warrants\") in lieu thereof) in an underwritten United States public offering.\n• On April 4, we announced the pricing of its underwritten public offering of 1,538,500 common shares (or pre-\nfunded warrants (\"Pre-funded Warrants\") in lieu thereof) at a public offering price of $0.65 per share, for gross\nproceeds of approximately $1,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering\nexpenses.\n• On April 9, we announced the closing of the previously announced underwritten public offering of 735,000 common\nshares and 803,500 pre-funded warrants with an exercise price of $0.001 (\"Pre-funded Warrants\") at a public offering\nprice of US$0.65 per share and US$0.649 per Pre-funded Warrant, less the underwriting discount.\n• On April 30, we provided a corporate update ahead of our fiscal Q2 result, highlighting status of our military\ndigitization contracts through 2028, an MOU signed with the University of Ottawa to hire software coding graduates,\nwork with a large Canadian police agency as first adopter of KWESST LightningTM in advance of full market release,\nARWEN scaling to multiples of historical revenue and, major agencies continue evaluations of PARA OPS.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS.\n7 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nThree months ended March 31, Six months ended March 31, Change\n2024 2023 2024 2023 %\nRevenue $ 485,864 $ 1 61,403 $ 614,932 $ 4 78,736 28%\nCost of sales (243,681) (128,634) (426,554) (268,218) 59%\nGross profit 242,183 32,769 188,378 210,518 -11%\nGross margin % 49.8% 20.3% 30.6% 44.0%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") 2,044,489 1,665,971 3,377,489 2,644,458 28%\nSelling and marketing (\"S&M\") 418,027 1,152,916 914,622 1,607,103 -43%\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") 724,485 306,680 1,349,325 569,509 137%\nTotal operating expenses 3,187,001 3,125,567 5,641,436 4,821,070 17%\nOperating loss (2,944,818) (3,092,798) (5,453,058) (4,610,552) 18%\nOther expenses\nShare issuance costs - 57,548 - (1,309,545) N/A\nNet finance costs (61,658) (11,107) (74,855) (554,684) -87%\nForeign exchange gain (loss) (805) (19,684) 90,905 (150,040) -161%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (532,922) 1,838,972 1,497,832 3,189,395 -53%\nTotal other expenses, net (595,385) 1,865,729 1,513,882 1,175,126 29%\nNet loss $ (3,540,203) $ ( 1,227,069) $ (3,939,176) $ ( 3,435,426) 15%\nEBITDA loss (1) $ (3,158,891) $ ( 978,395) $ (3,223,246) $ ( 2,556,864) 26%\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(1) $ (2,466,567) $ ( 2,703,250) $ (4,589,897) $ ( 4,009,627) 14%\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.61) $ (0.29) $ (0.69) $ (1.17) -41%\nWeighted average common shares - basic 5,823,662 4,271,594 5,719,657 2,925,729 95%\n(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2024\nadjusted EBITDA loss was $2.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, a decrease of 9% and increase of 14%, respectively\nover the comparable prior period mainly due to increased operating expenses driven by increased research and development\ncosts, personnel costs, and professional fees, offset by an increase in revenue from our digitization contracts as well as a\nreduction in investor relations costs and marketing related travel and conference costs compared to the prior periods. The\n8 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nadjustments to EBITDA loss for Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2024 included the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Due to\nthe lower volume of stock-based grants in the last 12 months, compared to same prior period, this has resulted in a reduction\nin stock-based compensation expense in the current quarter and YTD compared to Q2 Fiscal 2023. The higher net finance\ncosts and share issuance costs for Q2 2024 over the comparable prior period is due to increased lease obligations and the\nsettlement of prior period related share issuance costs. The lower net finance costs and share issuance costs YTD Fiscal 2024\nover the comparable prior period is mainly due to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in Fiscal 2023 year-to-date.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased by $0.3 million in the second quarter compared to Q2 Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.2\nmillion generated from our digitization business line and $0.1 million from our non-lethal business line (driven from the sale\nof ARWEN products). Sales of ARWEN products for Q2 Fiscal 2024 were $205K, just shy of the anticipated $226K sales\npreviously announced in our March 21, 2024 press release, as we worked through the backlog of orders.\nTotal revenue increased by $0.1 million in YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to YTD Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.1\nmillion generated from our digitization business line. At the six-month period ended March 31, 2024, we had sales from our\nnon-lethal business line (driven from the sale of ARWEN products) of $240K, an increase of $27K from the same prior\nperiod.\nWe expect revenue to increase with the launch of KWESST LightningTM. We also expect revenue to increase from expected\ndemand/future orders for the new ARWEN 40mm ammunition and PARA OPS products. With respect to our DSEF contract,\nit was announced in Q2 2024 that the Canadian Government contracts have suspended the acceptance of new submissions of\nemployees, potentially delaying the onboard of three of the seven candidates already submitted and deferring acceptance of\nsubmissions for the remaining four candidates. KWESST is working with its JV partners and DND customer to address\nquestions related to the recent announcement to assess and mitigate the impact this may have on short-term business\noutcomes. The Company does not yet know the impact to its overall potential revenue over the remaining life of the contract.\nGross Profit\nIn Q2 Fiscal 2024, the gross profit was $0.2 million, compared to a negligible amount in the same period in 2023. For YTD\nFiscal 2024, we earned $0.2 million or gross margin of 30%, compared to $0.2 million or gross margin of 44% in the same\nperiod in 2023.\nIn Fiscal 2024, indirect costs associated with the ramp up of the Canadian Government contracts in Q1 resulted in lower gross\nmargin as compared to the same period in 2023. We expect gross profit / margin to continue to increase during Fiscal 2024\nfrom the other product lines described above.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX remained consistent with the comparable prior period in the three months ended March 31, 2024, though\nincreased G&A and research and development costs were offset by a decrease of sales and marketing costs in Q2 Fiscal 2024\nas compared to the same period in 2023, primarily for the same reasons as noted below in the YTD 2024 comparison.\nTotal OPEX was $5.6 million for YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to $4.8 million in YTD Fiscal 2023, an increase of $ 0.8 million\nover the comparable prior year due to the following factors:\n• G&A increased by $0.7 million, primarily due to the amortization of the LEC intangible in Fiscal 2024 ($0.5\nmillion), an increase in senior management and directors compensation to be in line with market and additional\npersonnel as compared to Fiscal 2023 ($0.1 million), as well as an increase in legal fees, offset by a decrease in audit\nfees for a net increase in professional fees as compared to Fiscal 2023 ($0.1 million).\n9 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n• S&M decreased by $0.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in investor relations costs and related sales and\nmarketing costs ($0.9 million), a decrease in business development costs ($0.3 million), offset by an increase in\nconsulting fees ($0.3 million) and personnel costs ($0.2 million) in Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023.\n• R&D increased by $0.8 million, primarily due to the fact that the LEC has reached commercial feasibility, and any\nassociated costs are no longer being capitalized, while it was still in the development stage in Fiscal 2023 ($0.5\nmillion), coupled with R&D costs related to the advancement of the BLDS project in Fiscal 2024, whereas it was in\nthe development stage in Fiscal 2023 ($0.1 million), and increase in personnel costs in Fiscal 2024 compared to the\nsame prior period ($0.1 million).\nOther income (expenses), net\nFor Q2 Fiscal 2024, our total other expense was $0.6 million, compared to total other income of $1.9 million in Q2 Fiscal\n2023. This change in other income (expenses) net is mainly due to the same reason noted below for YTD Fiscal 2024.\nFor YTD 2024, our total other income was $1.5 million, compared to total other income of $1.2 million for the same period\n2023. The change in other income (expenses) was driven mainly by:\n• $1.3 million in Share Offering Costs related to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in Fiscal 2023, whereas there\nwere no such offerings in Fiscal 2024;\n• $0.5 million decrease in net finance costs is primarily due to the Fiscal 2023 recognition of the remaining\nunamortized accretion costs and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the\nclosing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering;\n• $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange gain due to appreciation in the U.S. currency during the period; offset by\n• $1.7 million unfavorable change in fair value of warrant liabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant\nliabilities at March 31, 2024, driven by a decrease in the underlying common share price on March 31, 2024. Under\nIFRS, we are required to remeasure the warrant liabilities at each reporting date until they are exercised or expired.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to March 31, 20224 (unaudited):\n2024 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3\nRevenue 4 86 1 29 6 06 1 50 1 61 3 17 2 55 2 82\nNet loss ( 3,540) ( 399) ( 2,419) ( 3,452) ( 1,227) ( 2,208) ( 2,345) ( 2,600)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2024 due to the suspension of new candidate\nsubmissions with our ongoing DSEF contract, as well as ramp up of new military contracts as we launch PARA OPS.\nAdditionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the remeasurement of warrant liabilities at each\nreporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\n10 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nMarch 31, September 30,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2,170,243 $ 6 ,842,074\nNon-current 4 ,346,421 4 ,916,758\nTotal assets $ 6,516,664 $ 1 1,758,832\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 4,348,793 $ 6 ,383,635\nNon-current 1 ,455,492 1 ,439,577\nTotal liabilities 5 ,804,285 7 ,823,212\nNet assets $ 712,379 $ 3 ,935,620\nWorking capital (1) $ (2,178,550) $ 4 58,439\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was negative $2.2 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.6 million from September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily due to the net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2024. Current liabilities include warrant liabilities, a non-\ncash liability item (see Note 10 of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements). Excluding warrant liabilities, we would have\npositive working capital. These warrant liabilities will be extinguished when the warrants are exercised or expired. If\nexercised, the proceeds will provide us with additional capital to fund our future working capital requirements. There is no\nassurance that any warrants will be exercised.\nTotal assets decreased by $5.2 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in cash of $5.1 million and a\ndecrease in the unamortized value of non-current assets of $0.5 million.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $2 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due a decrease in the warrant liabilities of $2.1\nmillion, offset by an increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities of $0.1 million due to the timing of payments to\nsuppliers.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed the Private Placement pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5.59\nmillion (or CAD$7.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for\nfurther details including our expected use of proceeds). On December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian\nOffering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.4 million), before\n11 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nunderwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected\nuse of proceeds).\nAt March 31, 2024, our cash position was $0.2 million, a decrease of $5.1 million since September 30, 2023 primarily due to\ncash used in operations of $5 million.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our other products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business\nis dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise\nadditional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting our future financial\nposition and our performance. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to implement our business\nplan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial performance. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential sources of capital may\ninclude additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other\nthings, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new\ncustomer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event we raise\nadditional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional\nincurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and\nfinancial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or\nat all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance\nour commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nSix months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nCash inflows (outflows) by activity:\nOperting activities $ (4,979,109) $ ( 9,155,294)\nInvesting activities ( 69,407) ( 883,852)\nFinancing acitivities ( 94,759) 13,852,292\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ (5,143,275) $ 3 ,813,146\nCash, beginning of period 5,407,009 170,545\nCash, end of period $ 263,734 $ 3,983,691\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities decreased by $4.2 million to $5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024\nprimarily due to payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting fees, and bonuses in\nFiscal 2023 after the close of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in December 2022, coupled with significant prepaid\nexpenses during the six months ended March 31, 2023 including retention bonus for our head of PARA OPS (refundable in\nthe event he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us), compared to regular operating activities in Fiscal\n2024, with no significant transactions.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities was less than $0.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.8\nmillion mainly due to the Fiscal 2023 additional investment in the product development of our PARA OPS, coupled with\n12 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nadditional low-rate initial production equipment for PARA OPS, whereas there were no significant investments in equipment\nin Fiscal 2024.\nCash (used) provided by financing activities\nCash flow used by financing activities was less than $0.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to cash\nflow provided by financing activities of $13.7 million in Fiscal 2023 primarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S.\nIPO and Canadian Offering, partially offset by repayment of all outstanding borrowings during the Fiscal 2023 period to date.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million units at a public offering price of US$4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. All these warrants will expire on December 8, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of US$4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per Common Share exercise price of\nUS$5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of US$14.1 million (CAD $19.4\nmillion). After underwriting discounts and offering expenses, the net proceeds were US$11.2 million (CAD $15.2 million).\nSee Note 11(a) of Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nFor the estimated use of proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, refer to our annual MD&A for Fiscal 2023 dated\nJanuary 17, 2024.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we issued 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March 2022 loans and USD$223,321 of the August\n2022 loans, including unpaid accrued interest and 10% premium at maturity. See Note 11(a) of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial\nstatements for further details.\nOn January 10, 2024, we issued 46,709 common shares in a settlement of debt in an amount of approximately $97,615. See\nNote 11(a) of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for further details.\n14 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares of KWESST,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023 Offering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26 (CAD$2.98) per\ncommon share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of US$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-\nfunded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and Pre-funded Warrant being bundled with one\ncommon share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common Warrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder\nto acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is\nimmediately exercisable and entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50)\nper Common Share for a period of 60 months following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares\nand Pre-funded Warrants are each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately. See Note 11(a) of Q2\nFiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRefer to Note 8 of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for disclosure about KWESST’s related party transactions\nconducted in the normal course of business.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 15 of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for further disclosure our financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 2(f) of the Fiscal 2023 audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting policies and\nestimates that are critical to the understanding of our business operations and the results of our operations.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAt March 31, 2024, KWESST’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no stated par\nvalue. There were 6,049,204 outstanding and issued common shares as at March 31, 2024.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n15 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nOn April 9, 2024, we announced the closing of the Company’s underwritten public offering of 735,000 common shares and\n803,500 pre-funded warrants with an exercise price of $0.001 (\"Pre-funded Warrants\") at a public offering price of US$0.65\nper share and US$0.649 per Pre-funded Warrant, less the underwriting discount. The gross proceeds from the offering, before\ndeducting the underwriting discount of US$0.04875 per common share (being an aggregate of US$75,002 or 7.5% of the\npublic offering price of the securities) and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately\nUS$1,000,000. In addition, the Company issued to the underwriter as compensation for its services 76,925 common share\npurchase warrants with an exercise price of US$0.8125 per share.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim Filings and Rule 13a-\n15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, we have evaluated, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our management, including out Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the design\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nas of the end of the quarter. These DC&P are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\npublicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.\nBased upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level due to the\nmaterial weaknesses described below under “Management’s Assessment on Internal controls over Financial Reporting”. As\na result of the material weaknesses identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures.\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2024 in conformance with\nGAAP.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings and as\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), The Company’s\nmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, and designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”) to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”)\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent\nlimitations. ICFR is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgement and\nbreakdowns resulting from human failures. ICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.\nBecause of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by\nICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to\ndesign into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs at March 31, 2024, management assessed the design of our ICFR and concluded that our ICFR includes material\nweaknesses, described below. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in\ninterim or annual financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To compensate for this material\nweakness, management continues to perform additional account reconciliations and other analytical and substantive\nprocedures to ensure reliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The\n16 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nmaterial weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and\nmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nManagement, under the supervision, and with the participation, of our CEO and CFO and oversight of the Board of Directors,\nevaluated the effectiveness of our ICFR as at September 30, 2023 and evaluated the design at March 31, 2024 against the\nCOSO Framework. Based on these evaluations, Management concluded that material weaknesses existed as of March 31,\n2024, as described below, and due to these material weaknesses, ICFR is not effective as of March 31, 2024.\nIneffective control environment: The Company did not have an effective control environment due to the lack of a\nsufficient complement of fully trained personnel in financial reporting, accounting and IT with assigned\nresponsibility and accountability related to ICFR. This material weakness contributed to the other material\nweaknesses below.\nSpreadsheet Controls: The Company did not implement and maintain effective controls surrounding certain\nspreadsheets. Spreadsheets are inherently prone to error due to the manual nature, which increases the risk of human\nerror. The Company’s controls related to complex spreadsheets did not address all identified risks associated with\nmanual data entry, review of inputs into management assumptions and estimates, completeness of data entry, and\nthe accuracy of mathematical formulas, impacting complex spreadsheets used in revenue, inventory, impairment\nand financial closing processes.\nIT General Controls: The Company had an aggregation of deficiencies within its IT general controls across multiple\nsystems, including deficiencies related to segregation of duties, user access and change management. As a result,\nthe Company concluded that its process-level automated and manual controls in the areas of journal entries and\nfinancial reporting that are dependent on IT general controls, information, and data derived from affected IT systems\nwere also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nManagement Review Controls: The Company did not consistently have documented evidence of management\nreview controls and did not always maintain segregation of duties between preparing and reviewing analyses and\nreconciliations with respect to revenue, inventory, purchasing, and financial closing.\nChanges to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2023 and Q2 2024 to date, the Company underwent a series of changes that materially affected areas reasonably\nlikely to continue to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management has\ncontinued efforts to develop and enhance the performance of ICFR. The addition of additional qualified finance and HR staff\nas well as the appointment of its CFO and CEO who are both experienced and qualified CPAs, will have a positive effect on\nthe Company’s ability to remediate its internal control deficiencies.\nRemediation Plan\nLate in the second half of fiscal year 2023, and subsequent to the fiscal year-end 2023, the Company strengthened its ability\nto remediate the above noted material weaknesses with the addition of:\n- Additional qualified finance and HR staff;\n- Addition of qualified CPAs in both the CFO and CEO roles;\n- Engagement of an external IT consultant and reorganizing accountability for IT general controls within the Company’s\nmanagement team with a qualified internal leader.\nThese measures have made improvements to the deficiencies that aggregate to form the material weaknesses identified above.\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the\nidentified material weaknesses with a focus on enhancing business processes and controls as the company continues to\nmature. Management will additionally:\n17 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n- Review its IT strategy and investigating ways to improve key software applications and investigating ways to improve\nkey software applications.\n- Review key business processes and controls to determine where further system reliance can potentially mitigate the use\nof complex spreadsheets, improve segregation of duties, and reduce reliance on manual management review controls.\n- Improve control tools and templates to aide with the sufficient and consistent documentation of review controls and\nprocedures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described\nabove.\n18 | P ag e"

In addition, the Beneficial Shareholder must notify the appointee of\ntheir appointment, obtain their consent to act as appointee and instruct him or her on how the Beneficial\nShareholder’s shares are to be voted. Following receipt of the duly completed voting instruction form, the\nTransfer Agent will send by email to your appointee (whether this appointee is you or another person) a\n12-digit appointee control number that the appointee will be able to use in order to fill out the online\nregistration form available at https://bit.ly/3X1iR0j with the requested information, i.e., their full name,\nemail address and 12-digit appointee control number provided by the Transfer Agent. Once this step is\ncompleted, the appointee will receive an email confirming the registration. On the day preceding the date\nof the Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the appointee who registered himself or herself as provided\nabove and who is eligible to participate at the Meeting will receive an email containing a link to the\nMeeting platform that will allow such appointee to participate, interact, ask questions or vote at the\nMeeting. Such 12-digit appointee control number will be different from the “control number” indicated\non the voting instruction form provided by the Transfer Agent. This appointee information is necessary to\nallow the appointee to vote at the Meeting. The steps set forth above must be completed prior to the proxy\ndeadline, failing which the appointee will not be able to vote at the Meeting. On the day of the Meeting,\nappointees will be able to vote during the live webcast by completing a ballot online during the Meeting\nand by logging in to the Meeting platform using the link provided 24 hours before the start of the Meeting\nor any adjournment thereof.\n1.4 Appointment of proxies\nA Registered Shareholder may vote in person at the Meeting or may appoint another person to represent\nsuch Registered Shareholder as proxy and to vote the Common Shares of such Registered Shareholder at\nthe Meeting. In order to appoint another person as proxy, a Registered Shareholder must complete, execute\nand deliver the form of proxy accompanying this Circular, or another proper form of proxy, in the manner\nspecified in the Notice of Meeting.\nThe purpose of a form of proxy is to designate persons who will vote on the Shareholder’s behalf in\naccordance with the instructions given by the Shareholder in the form of proxy. The persons named in the\n3 | P a g e\nenclosed form of proxy are officers or directors of the Company. A REGISTERED SHAREHOLDER\nDESIRING TO APPOINT SOME OTHER PERSON, WHO NEED NOT BE A SHAREHOLDER\nOF THE COMPANY, TO REPRESENT HIM, HER OR IT AT THE MEETING MAY DO SO BY\nFILLING IN THE NAME OF SUCH PERSON IN THE BLANK SPACE PROVIDED IN THE\nFORM OF PROXY OR BY COMPLETING ANOTHER PROPER FORM OF PROXY. A\nRegistered Shareholder wishing to be represented by proxy at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof\nmust, in all cases, deposit the completed form of proxy with the Transfer Agent not later than 3:00 p.m.\n(EST) on September 25, 2024 or, if the Meeting is adjourned, not later than 48 hours, excluding Saturdays,\nSundays and holidays, preceding the time of such adjourned Meeting at which the form of proxy is to be\nused. A form of proxy should be executed by the Registered Shareholder, or their attorney duly authorized\nin writing or, if the Registered Shareholder is a corporation, by an officer or attorney thereof duly\nauthorized.\nProxies may be deposited with the Transfer Agent using one of the following methods:\nBy Hand or Mail Delivery TSX Trust Company\nSuite 301, 100 Adelaide Street West\nToronto, Ontario, M5H 4H1\nFacsimile: 416-595-9593\nBy Internet: www.voteproxyonline.com\nYou will need to provide your 12 digit control number (located on the\nform of proxy accompanying this Circular)\nA Registered Shareholder attending the Meeting virtually has the right to vote virtually and, if he, she or\nit does so, his, her or its form of proxy is nullified with respect to the matters such person votes upon at\nthe Meeting and any subsequent matters thereafter to be voted upon at the Meeting or any adjournment\nthereof.\n1.5 Revocation of proxies\nA Registered Shareholder who has given a proxy may revoke it by an instrument in writing executed by\nthe Shareholder or by their representative authorized in writing. If the Shareholder is a company, the\nrevocation must be signed by a representative of the Company, or their representative authorized in\nwriting. The revocation of a proxy must be deposited at the registered office of the Company or with the\nTransfer Agent at the address set out in the enclosed form of proxy and notice of meeting, no later than at\nthe close of business on the last business day preceding the day of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof,\nor with the chairman at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof.\nAlso, note that if you are a Registered Shareholder and use your control number to log in to the Meeting,\nany vote you cast at the Meeting will revoke any proxy you previously submitted. If you do not wish to\nrevoke a previously submitted proxy or voting instruction form, as the case may be, you should not vote\nduring the Meeting\n1.6 Notice to Beneficial Shareholders\nNational Instrument 54-101 - Communication with beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer\n4 | P a g e\n(“NI-54-101”) requires brokers and other intermediaries to seek voting instructions from Beneficial\nShareholders in advance of shareholders’ meetings. The various brokers and other intermediaries have\ntheir own mailing procedures and provide their own return instructions to clients, which should be\ncarefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their shares are voted at the Meeting.\nThe form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial Shareholder by its broker (or the agent of the broker) is\nsubstantially similar to the form of proxy provided directly to Registered Shareholders.\nThe vast majority of brokers now delegate responsibility of obtaining instructions from clients to\nBroadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (“BFSI”) in Canada. BFSI typically prepares a machine-readable\nvoting instruction form, mails those forms to Beneficial Shareholders and asks Beneficial Shareholders to\nreturn the forms to BFSI, or otherwise communicate voting instructions to BFSI (by way of the Internet\nor telephone, for example). BFSI then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides\nappropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting. A Beneficial\nShareholder who receives a BFSI voting instruction form cannot use that form to vote shares directly at\nthe Meeting. The voting instruction forms must be returned to BFSI (or instructions respecting the voting\nof shares must otherwise be communicated to BFSI) well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the\nshares voted. If you have any questions respecting the voting of shares held through a broker or other\nintermediary, please contact your broker or other intermediary of assistance.\nThis Information Circular and accompanying materials are being sent to both Registered Shareholders and\nBeneficial Shareholders. Beneficial Shareholders fall into two categories - those who object to their\nidentity being known to the issuers of securities which they own (“Objecting Beneficial Owners”, or\n“OBO’s”) and those who do not object to their identity being known to the issuers of the securities they\nown (“Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners”, or “NOBO’s”). Subject to the provision of NI-54-101 issuers\nmay request and obtain a list of their NOBO’s from intermediaries via their transfer agents. If you are a\nBeneficial Shareholder, and the Company or its agent has sent these materials directly to you, your name,\naddress and information about your holdings of common shares have been obtained in accordance with\napplicable securities regulatory requirements from the intermediary holding the common shares on your\nbehalf. By choosing to send these materials to you directly, the Company (and not the intermediary holding\nthe common shares on your behalf) has assumed responsibility for delivering these materials to you and\nexecuting your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting instructions as specified in the request\nfor voting instructions.\nThe Company’s OBO’s can expect to be contacted by BFSI or their brokers or their broker’s agents as set\nout above.\nAlthough a Beneficial Shareholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of\nvoting shares registered in the name of his or her broker (or his or her broker’s agent), a Beneficial\nShareholder may attend the Meeting as proxyholder for the Registered Shareholder and vote the shares as\nproxyholder for the Registered Shareholder by entering his or her own name in the blank space on the\nproxy form provided to him or her by his or her broker (or his or her broker’s agent) and return it to that\nbroker (or that broker’s agent) in accordance with the broker’s instructions (or the agent’s instructions).\nAll references to shareholders in this Information Circular, the enclosed form of proxy and the Notice of\nMeeting are to the Registered Shareholders unless specifically stated otherwise.\n5 | P a g e\n1.6 Exercise of Discretion by Proxyholders and Appointees\nCommon Shares represented by properly executed proxies or voting instruction forms in favour of\nthe proxyholders named in the enclosed form of proxy and the appointees named in the enclosed\nvoting instruction form, in the absence of any direction to the contrary, will be voted FOR the\nadoption of a resolution authorizing, if deemed advisable by the board of directors of the Company,\nthe consolidation, no later than twelve months from the date of the Meeting, of the issued and\noutstanding common shares of the Company on the basis of one common share for a maximum of\nevery fifty (50) common shares issued and outstanding.\nThe proxyholder named in the form of proxy or the appointee named in the voting instruction form, as the\ncase may be, shall have discretionary authority with respect to amendments or variations to matters\nidentified in the notice of meeting and with respect to other matters which may properly come before the\nMeeting. At the time of printing this Circular, the management of the Company is not aware of any such\namendments, variations or other matters. In the event of a ballot, the shares represented by proxy will be\nvoted by the proxyholder or the appointee, as the case may be, in accordance with the instructions of the\nshareholder with respect to the matters set out in the form of proxy.\n1.7 Interest of certain persons in the matters to be acted upon\nTo the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Company, no director or executive officer\nof the Company, any proposed nominee for election as director of the Company, or any associate or\naffiliate of any of the foregoing persons, has any material interest, direct or in direct, by way of beneficial\nownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter to be acted upon at the Meeting.\n1.8 Record date\nThe directors of the Company have fixed Tuesday, August 20, 2024, as the record date (the “Record\nDate”) for the purpose of determining the Shareholders entitled to receive the notice of meeting, and\nauthorized to vote or act at the Meeting. No shareholder who has become a shareholder after the Record\nDate will be entitled to attend or vote at the Meeting or any adjournment(s) thereof.\n1.9 Voting securities and Quorum\nThe authorized capital of the Company consists of an unlimited number of Common Shares. As of the\ndate hereof, 15,791,742 Common Shares were issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable.\nA quorum shall be present at the Meeting if two or more holders of Common Shares representing at least\n5% of the total number of voting rights attaching to the said Common Shares entitled to be voted at the\nMeeting are present or represented by proxy.\n1.10 Principal holder of voting securities\nAs of the date hereof, to the knowledge of our directors and executive officers, no person or company\nbeneficially owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, Common Shares carrying 10% or more of\n6 | P a g e\nthe voting rights attached to all of the Common Shares.\nSECTION 2 - BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT THE MEETING\nSHARE CONSOLIDATION\nOn May 16, 2024, the Company received a notification letter (the “Notification Letter”) from the Nasdaq\nStock Market (“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that it was not in compliance with Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2), as the bid price of the Company’s Common Shares on the Nasdaq had closed at less than\nUS$1.00 per share over the prior 30 consecutive business days (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”).\nThe Notification Letter indicated that the Company has until November 12, 2024 (the “Compliance\nPeriod”) to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nWhile the Company’s governing statute, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) does not\nrequire the approval of Shareholders in order to give effect to the Consolidation, the policies of the TSX\nVenture Exchange require that a consolidation of a company’s share capital at a ratio greater than 10:1 be\napproved by a company’s shareholders.\nAccordingly, shareholders will be asked to approve a resolution in the form described below (the\n“Consolidation Resolution”), authorizing, if deemed advisable by the board of directors, the\nconsolidation of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company on the basis of one share for\na maximum of every fifty (50) Common Shares issued and outstanding (the “Share Consolidation”) in\norder to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In order to be adopted, the\nConsolidation Resolution must be approved by at the majority of the votes cast by the holders of the\nCommon Shares, either present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting. Unless otherwise\nspecified, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy intend to vote for the Consolidation\nResolution.\nIf the Consolidation Resolution is adopted by the shareholders, the consolidation shall be effected by the\nboard of directors only if and when deemed advisable by the board of directors in its discretion, but in no\ncase later than twelve months from the date of the Meeting. In such event, subject to the maximum referred\nto above, the determination of the basis for the consolidation will be at the discretion of the board of\ndirectors but shall not exceed a basis of one share for a maximum of every fifty (50) Common Shares\nissued and outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Consolidation Resolution authorizes the board\nof directors to (i) determine the appropriate ratio of the Consolidation subject to the maximum ration\ncontemplated by the Consolidation Resolution and (ii) abandon the Share Consolidation without further\napproval from the shareholders. Unless otherwise specified, the persons named in the accompanying form\nof proxy intend to vote for the Consolidation Resolution.\nIn the event that the Share Consolidation would result in a Registered Shareholder holding a fraction of a\ncommon share, such fractional common share shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of Common\nShares and any fractional common share post-Share Consolidation will be cancelled without payment of\nany consideration. In all other respects, the post-consolidation Common Shares will have the same\nattributes as the existing Common Shares. The Share Consolidation will not change a shareholder's\nproportionate interest in the Company, even though such ownership will be represented by a smaller\n7 | P a g e\nnumber of Common Shares.\nThe principal effect of the Share Consolidation will be that the number of Common Shares issued and\noutstanding will be reduced from 15,791,742 Common Shares as of August 26, 2024 to 315,834 Common\nShares, assuming a maximum consolidation ratio of 50:1. The following table sets out the percentage\nreduction in the number of outstanding Common Shares and the number of Common Shares that would\nbe outstanding as a result of a consolidation at the ratios indicated:\nPercentage Reduction in Number of Number of Outstanding Common Shares\nProposed Consolidation Ratio\nOutstanding Common Shares Post-Consolidation\n1 for 50 98% 315,834\nIn general, the Share Consolidation will not be considered to result in a disposition of Common Shares by\nshareholders for Canadian federal income tax purposes. The aggregate adjusted cost base to a shareholder\nfor such purposes of all Common Shares held by the shareholder will not change as a result of the Share\nConsolidation; however, the shareholder’s adjusted cost base per common share will increase\nproportionately.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that the total market capitalization of the Company (the aggregate\nvalue of all Common Shares at the market price then in effect) immediately after the Share Consolidation\nwill be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization immediately before the Share Consolidation.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that the per-share market price of the Common Shares following\nthe Share Consolidation will equal or exceed the direct arithmetical result of the Share Consolidation. In\naddition, a decline in the market price of the Common Shares after the Share Consolidation may result in\na greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a Share Consolidation and the liquidity of\nthe Common Shares could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the issued and outstanding Common Shares, the Common Shares currently reserved for\nissuance by the Company will be adjusted to give effect to the Share Consolidation, such that the number\nof consolidated Common Shares issuable will equal the number obtained when the number of Common\nShares issuable is divided by the conversion number and the exercise prices of outstanding options and/or\nwarrants to purchase consolidated Common Shares will equal the price obtained by multiplying the\nexisting exercise price by the conversion number.\nIf the Consolidation Resolution is passed at the Meeting and the board of directors decides to proceed with\nthe Share Consolidation, the Company will announce that it is proceeding with the consolidation prior to\nthe completion thereof. Registered Shareholders should then, at that time, complete, sign and return the\nLetter of Transmittal that will be sent to such registered holders, along with the share certificate(s)\nrepresenting their pre-consolidation Common Shares, to TSX Trust Company at one of the addresses in\nthe Letter of Transmittal. Upon receipt of a properly-completed and signed Letter of Transmittal and the\nshare certificate(s) referred to in the Letter of Transmittal, the Company will arrange to have a new share\ncertificate representing the appropriate number of post-consolidation Common Shares delivered in\naccordance with the instructions provided by the holder in the Letter of Transmittal. No delivery of a new\ncertificate to a shareholder will be made until the shareholder has surrendered his current issued\ncertificates. Until surrendered, each share certificate formerly representing old Common Shares shall be\n8 | P a g e\ndeemed for all purposes to represent the number of new Common Shares to which the holder is entitled as\na result of the Share Consolidation.\nIf a shareholder’s Common Shares are registered in the name of a nominee (e.g. a trust company, securities\nbroker, or other financial institution), the shareholder will not receive a Letter of Transmittal and should\ncontact its nominee to determine if the shareholder need to do anything to effect the consolidation of its\nCommon Shares.\nShareholders will be asked at the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to consider, and if deemed\nadvisable, adopt the following resolutions:\n“WHEREAS on May 16, 2024, the Company received a notification letter (the “Notification Letter”) from\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that it was not in compliance with Listing\nRule 5550(a)(2), as the bid price of the Company’s common shares (the “Common Shares”) on the\nNasdaq had closed at less than US$1.00 per share over the prior 30 consecutive business days (the\n“Minimum Bid Price Requirement”);\nWHEREAS the Notification Letter indicated that the Company has until November 12, 2024 (the\n“Compliance Period”) to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement;\nWHEREAS the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) is of the opinion that it is in the best\ninterests of the Company and its shareholders (the “Shareholders”) that it be given the discretion to\nproceed with a consolidation of the issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of a maximum of\none new Common Share for every fifty (50) existing Common Shares (the “Consolidation”) in order to\nregain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement;\nWHEREAS as a consequence of the Consolidation, all issued and outstanding options, warrants and other\ninstruments or rights exercisable for or convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares or correlated\nwith the price thereof shall be adjusted in accordance with the terms and conditions of such securities and\ninstruments;\nWHEREAS the Company anticipates that the Consolidation will have a neutral economic effect on\nShareholders and holders of any outstanding options, warrants and other instruments or rights exercisable\nfor or convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares or correlated with the price thereof, except to the\nextent the Consolidation will result in fractional shares;\nWHEREAS pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) governing the Company and\nthe constating documents of the Company, the Consolidation does not require the approval of\nShareholders; however, the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange require shareholder approval for any\nsecurity consolidation which, when combined with any other security consolidation conducted by the\nIssuer within the previous 24 months that was not approved by its Shareholders, would result in a\ncumulative consolidation ratio of greater than 10 to 1 over such 24 month period.\nBE AND IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED:\n9 | P a g e\nCONSOLIDATION OF THE COMMON SHARES\n1. The Company is hereby authorized to alter its share structure by consolidating each of the\nissued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company by exchanging up to fifty (50)\nCommon Shares of the Company, or such lesser or greater amount as the directors of the\nCompany may determine, into one (1) Common Share of the Company, provided that in the\nevent the consolidation would result in a shareholder of the Company holding a fraction of a\nshare, no such fractional share will be issued, but the number of Common Shares to be\nreceived by such shareholder that is less than 1/2 of a share must be cancelled and each\nfractional share that is at least 1/2 of a share must be changed to one whole share in\naccordance with section 83 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the\n“Consolidation”).\n2. The Consolidation shall be effective at 12:01 a.m. (Eastern time) on the date determined by\nthe board of directors of the Company and approved by the relevant regulatory authorities\n(the “Effective Date”), be and is hereby authorized and approved.\n3. No physical share certificates shall be provided to Shareholders to represent the Common\nShares issued pursuant to the Consolidation. Such Common Shares shall be uncertificated\nshares, represented by an entry in the securities register of the Company or of its transfer\nagent.\n4. Any officer or director of the Company is hereby authorized and directed for and on behalf of\nthe Company to execute and deliver, under corporate seal of the Company or otherwise all\ndocuments and instruments and to do all such other acts and things as in his or her opinion\nmay be necessary or desirable to give full effect to the above resolutions.\n5. Notwithstanding that this resolution has been passed by the shareholders of the Company, the\nboard of directors be and are hereby authorized and empowered, without further approval of\nthe shareholders of the Company, to determine the consolidation ratio or revoke this resolution\nat any time before the Consolidation becomes effective.\nSTOCK EXCHANGE MATTERS\n6. Any one director or officer of the Company be and is hereby authorized to execute and deliver\nany documents required to be filed with the TSX Venture Exchange and / or the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket on behalf of the Company to give effect to the Consolidation, and the execution and\ndelivery by any director or officer of the Company of any such filing be and is hereby\nauthorized, approved, ratified and confirmed.\nPRESS RELEASES\n7.
