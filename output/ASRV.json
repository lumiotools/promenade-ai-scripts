It is the culmination of a grass roots effort that mobilized AmeriServ staffers into collecting and donating backpacks to provide veterans with items needed to make the transition from active duty to civilian life. The backpacks were collected and distributed through a partnership with Veterans Leadership Program (VLP).AmeriServ representatives delivered backpacks to the Johnstown office of VLP on Wednesday, November 6, 2024. The office, located in the Hiram G. Andrews Center along Goucher Street in Johnstown, is one of three VLP offices servicing veterans in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio.AmeriServ president and CEO, Jeff Stopko was on hand to help deliver backpacks to the local VLP office. “It is no coincidence that our backpack collection project culminated with this delivery just days before we commemorate Veteran’s Day. The service men and women who selflessly serve our nation and protect our freedoms must be remembered and provided with the help they need when returning home. If these backpacks and the items we have collected provide them with one less thing to worry about while providing some level of comfort, we are helping them take the necessary steps toward a more certain future.”**ABOUT Veterans Leadership Program (VLP)** For 40 years, VLP has operated with a focus on empowering veterans to navigate the transition from service member to citizen by providing collaborative, supportive, and service-oriented expertiseand resources delivered through comprehensive programs and partnerships.
