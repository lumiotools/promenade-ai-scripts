(Nasdaq: ATYR) (“aTyr” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of first-in-class medicines from its proprietary tRNA synthetase platform, today announced third quarter 2024 results and provided a corporate update. \n\n“We achieved a significant milestone this quarter by completing enrollment in our global pivotal Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ study in pulmonary sarcoidosis and topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2025,” said Sanjay S. Shukla, M.D., M.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of aTyr. “Additionally, our efzofitimod program was featured in this year’s Best of CHEST Journals session at the CHEST 2024 annual meeting and we recently published favorable steroid relapse data for efzofitimod in the _European Respiratory Journal._ These events have generated increased interest in efzofitimod and the potential promise it holds to be a transformative therapy for patients.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Subsequent Period Highlights**\n\n  * **Completed enrollment in the global pivotal Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efzofitimod in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.** This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study consisting of three parallel cohorts randomized equally to either 3.0 mg/kg or 5.0 mg/kg of efzofitimod or placebo dosed intravenously monthly for a total of 12 doses. The study enrolled 268 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis at 85 centers in nine countries, which exceeded the targeted enrollment. Topline data from the study are expected in the third quarter of 2025. Patients who complete the study and wish to receive treatment with efzofitimod outside of the clinical trial are eligible to participate in an Individual Patient Expanded Access Program (EAP).\n  * **Continued** **enrollment in the Phase 2 EFZO-CONNECT™ study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of efzofitimod in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc, or scleroderma)-related interstitial lung disease**(**SSc-ILD).** This proof-of-concept study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-week study consisting of three parallel cohorts randomized 2:2:1 to either 270 mg or 450 mg of efzofitimod or placebo dosed intravenously monthly for a total of six doses. The study intends to enroll up to 25 patients with SSc-ILD and is open for enrollment at multiple centers in the United States. Patients who complete the study and wish to receive ongoing treatment with efzofitimod are eligible to participate in a 24-week open-label extension (OLE). Interim data from the study are expected in the second quarter of 2025.\n  * **Publication demonstrating the efficacy of efzofitimod in pulmonary sarcoidosis published in the**** _European Respiratory Journal_****.** Findings from a post hoc analysis of the Phase 1b/2a study of efzofitimod in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in time-to-first relapse for corticosteroid use and improvement in corticosteroid relapse rate in therapeutic (3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg efzofitimod) versus subtherapeutic (1.0 mg/kg efzofitimod and placebo) groups. The publication, entitled, “Therapeutic Doses of Efzofitimod Demonstrate Efficacy in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis,” is available on the Journal’s website and can be accessed at: <https://openres.ersjournals.com/content/early/2024/07/18/23120541.00536-2024>.\n  * **Efzofitimod for pulmonary sarcoidosis featured in the Best of CHEST Journals session at the CHEST 2024 Annual Meeting**. The session featured recent data and publications that generated significant interest and readership among the pulmonology community. Dr. Daniel A. Culver, Chair of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, presented data from the Phase 1b/2a study published in _CHEST_ , the post hoc analysis on corticosteroid steroid relapse published in the _European Respiratory Journal_ with further elucidation on efzofitimod’s mechanism of action.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights and Cash Position**\n\n  * **Cash & Investment Position:** Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments as of September 30, 2024, were $68.9 million. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter 2024, the Company raised approximately $19.4 million in gross proceeds from its at-the-market (ATM) offering with Jefferies LLC, before deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.\n  * **Financial Guidance:** The Company believes its cash runway will be sufficient to fund its operations through the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for efzofitimod in pulmonary sarcoidosis.\n  * **R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $14.8 million for the third quarter 2024, which consisted primarily of clinical trial costs for the Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ and Phase 2 EFZO-CONNECT™ studies, manufacturing costs for the efzofitimod program and research and development costs for the efzofitimod and discovery programs.\n  * **G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the third quarter 2024.\n\n\n\n**About Efzofitimod**\n\nEfzofitimod is a first-in-class biologic immunomodulator in clinical development for the treatment of interstitial lung disease (ILD), a group of immune-mediated disorders that can cause inflammation and fibrosis, or scarring, of the lungs. Efzofitimod is a tRNA synthetase derived therapy that selectively modulates activated myeloid cells through neuropilin-2 to resolve inflammation without immune suppression and potentially prevent the progression of fibrosis. aTyr is currently investigating efzofitimod in the global Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ study in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, a major form of ILD, and in the Phase 2 EFZO-CONNECT™ study in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc, or scleroderma)-related ILD. These forms of ILD have limited therapeutic options and there is a need for safer and more effective, disease-modifying treatments that improve outcomes. \n\n**About aTyr**\n\naTyr is a clinical stage biotechnology company leveraging evolutionary intelligence to translate tRNA synthetase biology into new therapies for fibrosis and inflammation. tRNA synthetases are ancient, essential proteins that have evolved novel domains that regulate diverse pathways extracellularly in humans. aTyr’s discovery platform is focused on unlocking hidden therapeutic intervention points by uncovering signaling pathways driven by its proprietary library of domains derived from all 20 tRNA synthetases. aTyr’s lead therapeutic candidate is efzofitimod, a first-in-class biologic immunomodulator in clinical development for the treatment of interstitial lung disease, a group of immune-mediated disorders that can cause inflammation and progressive fibrosis, or scarring, of the lungs.
