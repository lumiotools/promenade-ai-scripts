Shareholders of ClimateRock and other interested parties are urged to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety.\nUnless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement.\nGeneral Terms and Effects; Merger Consideration\nOn December 30, 2023, ClimateRock, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“ClimateRock” or “SPAC”), entered into an Agreement and\nPlan of Merger (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with GreenRock Corp, a Cayman Islands\nexempted company (“GreenRock” or the “Company”), ClimateRock Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of ClimateRock (“Holdings”), ClimateRock Merger Sub Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nHoldings (“SPAC Merger Sub”), and a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings expected to be named\n“GreenRock Merger Sub Corp.,” which is

contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, including the issuances of securities thereunder, the “Business Combination” or the “Transactions”).\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) SPAC Merger Sub will merge with and into\nClimateRock, with ClimateRock continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (the “SPAC Merger”), in connection\nwith which all of the existing securities of ClimateRock will be exchanged for rights to receive securities of Holdings as follows: (a) immediately prior\nto the SPAC Merger Effective Time, every issued and outstanding Unit of ClimateRock will be automatically separated and the holders thereof will\nbe deemed to hold one (1) Class A Ordinary Share of ClimateRock, par value $0.0001 (each, a “ClimateRock Class A Ordinary Share”), one-half\n(1/2) of a ClimateRock Warrant and one ClimateRock Right, (b) each ClimateRock Class A Ordinary Share outstanding immediately prior to the\nEffective Time that has not been redeemed and is not a Dissenting Share (as defined below) shall automatically convert into one ordinary share, par\nvalue $0.0001, issued by Holdings (each, a “Holdings Ordinary Share”), (c) each ClimateRock Class B Ordinary Share, par value $0.0001 (each, a\n“ClimateRock Class B Ordinary Share”, and together with the ClimateRock Class A Shares, the “ClimateRock Ordinary Shares”), outstanding\nimmediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time that is not a Dissenting Share (as defined below) shall automatically convert into one\nHoldings Ordinary Share, (d) each ClimateRock public warrant and each ClimateRock private warrant shall automatically convert into one warrant to\npurchase Holdings Ordinary Shares (each, a “Holdings Warrant”) on substantially the same terms and conditions; (e) each ClimateRock Right will\nbe automatically converted into the number of Holdings Ordinary Shares that would have been received by the holder of such Right if it had been\nconverted upon the consummation of a business combination in accordance with ClimateRock’s organizational documents, and (ii) Company\nMerger Sub will merge with and into GreenRock, with GreenRock continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (the\n“Company Merger”, and together with the SPAC Merger, the “Mergers”), pursuant to which (x) each GreenRock ordinary share (the “GreenRock\nOrdinary Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted\ninto the right to receive the applicable portion of Holdings Ordinary Shares constituting the Merger Consideration (as defined below) and (y) each\nissued and outstanding GreenRock convertible security shall be converted into Holdings convertible securities of like tenor and shall have, and be\nsubject to, substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable organizational document of GreenRock, except that they shall\nrepresent the right to acquire Holdings Ordinary Shares in lieu of GreenRock Ordinary Shares.\nIn accordance with the Companies Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the “Cayman Act”), any ClimateRock Ordinary Share issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for which any ClimateRock Shareholder (such ClimateRock Shareholder, a “Dissenting\nShareholder”) has validly exercised properly in writing their dissenters’ rights for such ClimateRock Ordinary Shares in accordance with Cayman\nAct, and has otherwise complied in all respects with all of the provisions of the Cayman Act relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters’\nrights (collectively, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive, and the applicable Dissenting Shareholder shall have\nno right to receive, the applicable Holdings Ordinary Shares to which the holder of such Dissenting Shares would otherwise be entitled unless and\nuntil such Dissenting SPAC Shareholder effectively withdraws or loses such dissenters’ rights.\n1\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consideration to be delivered to the holders of GreenRock Ordinary Shares (the\n“GreenRock Shareholders”) in connection with the Business Combination (the “Merger Consideration”) will be 44,685,000 newly-issued\nHoldings Ordinary Shares, of which 16,685,000 will be held in a segregated account (the “Escrowed Shares”) pursuant to an escrow agreement (the\n“Escrow Agreement”) that Holdings, ClimateRock, and GreenRock will enter into at or prior to Closing with an escrow agent mutually acceptable to\nClimateRock and GreenRock (the “Escrow Agent”). The GreenRock Shareholders shall be shown as registered owners of their respective Escrowed\nShares on the books and records of Holdings, and shall be entitled to exercise voting rights with respect to such Escrowed Shares, and any\ndividends, distributions and other earnings on the Escrowed Shares while held in escrow shall be paid directly to the GreenRock Shareholders. The\nEscrowed Shares will be subject to forfeiture by the GreenRock Shareholders if GreenRock fails to meet the targets described below:\n1) If on the later to occur of (x) the closing date of the Business Combination and (y) March 31, 2024 (the “First Checkpoint Date”), the year-\nto-date Adjusted EBITDA of GreenRock exceeds $24,348,000 (the “EBITDA Minimum”) then a portion of the Escrowed Shares shall be\nreleased to the GreenRock Shareholders in an amount equal total number of Escrowed Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is amount by which the Adjusted EBITDA of GreenRock as of the First Checkpoint Date exceeds the EBITDA Minimum, and the\ndenominator of which is $14,502,000; provided that if the Adjusted EBITDA of GreenRock is less than the EBITDA Minimum on the First\nCheckpoint Date, all Escrowed Shares will remain in escrow until the date that GreenRock’s audited financial statements for fiscal year 2024\nare filed with the SEC (the “Second Checkpoint Date”).\n2) If on the Second Checkpoint Date,\na) GreenRock’s Adjusted EBITDA for the 2024 fiscal year is less than the Adjusted EBITDA calculated at the First Checkpoint Date,\nthen all remaining Escrowed Shares will be forfeited by the GreenRock Shareholders, surrendered to Holdings for no consideration,\nand cancelled;\nb) GreenRock’s Adjusted EBITDA for the 2024 Fiscal year is greater than the GreenRock Adjusted EBITDA calculated at the First\nCheckpoint Date, but less than $38,850,000 (the “EBITDA Target”), then a portion of the Escrowed Shares will be released to the\nGreenRock Shareholders in an amount equal total number of Escrowed Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is\namount by which the 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of GreenRock exceeds the EBITDA Minimum, and the denominator of which is\n$14,502,000, minus the number of Escrowed Shares released in connection with the First Checkpoint Date (if any); provided that any\nremaining unreleased Escrowed Shares will be forfeited by the GreenRock Shareholders, surrendered to Holdings for no\nconsideration, and cancelled; or\nc) GreenRock’s Adjusted EBITDA for the 2024 fiscal year is equal to or greater than the EBITDA Target, then all remaining Escrowed\nShares will be released to the GreenRock Shareholders.\nIn each case, GreenRock’s “Adjusted EBITDA” means GreenRock’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation or amortization, calculated in\naccordance with IFRS, plus 70% of the net sale price reflected in any signed letters of intent entered into by GreenRock and a third party in good\nfaith and on prevailing market terms for the sale of GreenRock’s assets.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of ClimateRock, Holdings, the Merger Subs and\nGreenRock as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the\n“Closing”). Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect” as used\nin the Merger Agreement means with respect to any specified person or entity, any fact, event, occurrence, change or effect that has had, or would\nreasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect upon (a) the business, results of operation or financial\ncondition of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) the ability of such person or any of its subsidiaries to consummate the\nTransactions, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and\nqualifications contained in the Merger Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement.\n2\nNo Survival\nThe representations and warranties of the parties contained in the Merger Agreement terminate as of, and do not survive, the Closing, and\nthere are no indemnification rights for another party’s breach, except that fraud claims survive indefinitely and the covenants and agreements\nrelevant to the Closing and any agreements or covenants which by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing.

power and more.**_Source: Eloi_Omella/E+ via Getty Images_  \n---  \n  \nOnce the hottest craze on Wall Street, special purpose acquisition companies have endured a fall from grace since the market peaked two years ago, but a few energy transition investors remain determined to succeed against the negative sentiment.\n\nInvestors use SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, to bring privately owned, fast-growing startups into public markets. The energy transition space has been a key beneficiary of the trend, with companies involved in electric vehicles, nuclear technology and battery storage among those being targeted.\n\nInterest in SPACs exploded in early 2021 but collapsed almost as quickly amid challenging market dynamics. Investors started to come under heightened scrutiny from regulators aimed at closing loopholes that allowed target companies to overstate their financial projections. Many companies have also struggled with stock performance since concluding their SPAC mergers.\n\n\"We're now in SPAC 2.0 where things are being much more regulated and governed,\" said Per Regnarsson, CEO of ClimateRock, a clean energy SPAC that listed on the Nasdaq in May 2022, more than a year after the initial rush.\n\n\"There was a lot of money going into these [targets] ... with no revenues, no cash flows and just a lot of promises,\" Regnarsson said in an interview. \"Now it's about investing in cash-flowing activities.\"\n\n![SNL Image](https://www.snl.com/articles/419212002.png)\n\n**'Probably gone too far'**\n\nSome 311 SPAC IPOs were completed globally in the first quarter of 2021, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, compared with just 138 in the whole of 2022.\n\nAt its height, the market received backing from stars in the worlds of sport and entertainment, including Shaquille O'Neal, Serena Williams and Jay-Z. For some, this attention was unwelcome.\n\n\"When you get rappers and celebrities sponsoring SPACs, it's probably gone too far,\" said Robin Duggan, executive director at European SPAC sponsor Climate Transition Capital, or CTC.\n\nThe market hype resulted in an oversupply of SPAC investors chasing a dwindling number of private-sector targets. SPACs typically have a two-year window to undergo a \"deSPAC\" — the process of finding and merging with a target. If they fail, the money raised at IPO is returned to investors and the SPAC is liquidated.\n\nThis time pressure meant some SPACs ended up merging with companies with different risk profiles than they set out to target, or in sectors outside of their original business plans.\n\nThe rate of investors selling their shares back to the SPACs — known as redemption — grew from about 10% during the 2021 peak to 99% in some cases, according to Alasdair Steele, corporate partner and head of equity capital markets at law firm CMS in London. \n\n\"People were taking all their money out, which kind of defeats the object of the SPAC,\" Steele said in an interview.\n\nIn a sign of the difficult market dynamics, some SPACs have been forced into liquidation months before their original expiry date, including certain vehicles that include energy among their target sectors. \n\nBroadscale Acquisition Corp., which raised $345 million at IPO in February 2021, recently brought forward its termination date by two months. Meanwhile, Fortistar Sustainable Solutions Corp. undertook a similar move Dec. 2 after failing to invest the $225 million it raised, nearly two years on.\n\n\"For the serial SPAC-doers who've got the track record ... [liquidation is] probably going to be better for their reputations than doing the wrong deal,\" Steele said.\n\n![SNL Image](https://www.snl.com/articles/419212005.png)\n\n**Fighting through the stigma**\n\nClimateRock opted for a relatively small IPO — raising $78.8 million — to put \"less pressure\" on redemptions, according to Regnarsson. In October, the vehicle agreed to merge with E.E.W. Eco Energy World PLC, a solar farm developer in Europe and Asia with a project pipeline of more than 10 GW.\n\nThe companies expect to close the deal in the first half of 2023, overcoming a milestone that has tripped up certain SPACs in the past.\n\nThat includes GFJ ESG Acquisition I SE, a Luxembourg-listed blank-check company, which terminated its deal to merge with German smart home startup tado GmbH in September, eight months after signing a letter of intent. GFJ quickly found another target in energy technology platform Learnd Ltd., signing a business combination agreement in October.\n\nGFJ is one of a growing number of European-listed SPACs, which account for just a fraction of the global total and are vastly outnumbered by U.S.-based SPACs. Since Jan. 1, 2021, the U.S. has seen 627 SPAC listings compared with just 61 in Europe, according to Market Intelligence data.\n\nEuropean SPAC sponsor CTC looked to the Euronext Amsterdam to list a SPAC vehicle, Climate Transition Capital Acquisition I BV, in June 2021, raising €190 million. According to CTC's Duggan, the supply-demand dynamic for SPACs in Europe is the \"exact inverse\" of the crowded U.S. market. \n\n\"You've got an undersupply of capital and an oversupply of good businesses that need capital,\" Duggan said in an interview. \"We've never yet spoken to a company where they've had another SPAC talking to them.\"\n\nCTC is still on the lookout for a target, focusing on opportunities in the decarbonization of energy, transport and heavy industry. During a shareholder meeting in June, Duggan said CTC has identified a database of over 400 investable companies and an active pipeline of 20 to 30 businesses. \n\nTarget companies are also apparently not scared off by the U.S. experience. \"The closer you get to a real opportunity, the less of a problem the perception is,\" Duggan said.\n\nWhile CTC's quest is complicated by the uncertain economic environment in Europe as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there are \"strategic benefits\" to being publicly listed, according to Executive Director Joris Rademakers. Executives are therefore determined to push on to prove that SPACs are viable funding models for energy transition businesses.\n\n\"If we can help get companies to the market earlier, we would have succeeded in our mission,\" Rademakers said in an interview. \"Unfortunately, SPACs have got a bad name, but I'm happy to fight through that.\"\n\n![SNL Image](https://www.snl.com/articles/419212015.png)\n\n_S &P Global Commodity Insights produces content for distribution on S&P Capital IQ Pro. _\n\n    * [](#)\n    * [](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n      * [ ](#) [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet)\n      * [ ](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n      *   * Author\n  * Alex BlackburneAnnie Sabater[Gaurang Dholakia](/marketintelligence/contributors/244439/gaurang-dholakia)\n  * Theme\n  * [Energy](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Energy&fn=custom_ss_theme)[Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Healthcare+%26+Pharmaceuticals&fn=custom_ss_theme)[Real Estate](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Real+Estate&fn=custom_ss_theme)[Banking](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Banking&fn=custom_ss_theme)[Fintech](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Fintech&fn=custom_ss_theme)[Insurance](/marketintelligence/en/search?q=Insurance&fn=custom_ss_theme)\n\n\n"

Cayman Islands exempted company and led by Chairman, Charles Ratelband V and CEO, Per Regnarsson, announced today the pricing of its initial public offering of 7,500,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share, one-half (1/2) of one redeemable warrant and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Class A ordinary share. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share, and each ten (10) rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one Class A ordinary share at the closing of a business combination. The exercise price of the warrants is $11.50 per whole share. The units are expected to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “CLRCU” beginning on April 28, 2022. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares, warrants and rights will be traded on Nasdaq under the symbols “CLRC,” “CLRCW,” and “CLRCR,” respectively.

The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.\n\nA registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-263542) relating to the securities to be sold in the initial public offering was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 27, 2022.
