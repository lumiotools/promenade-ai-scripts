Other Events.**\n\nThe Company believes that, in advance of the Annual Meeting and potentially in violation of federal securities laws, a solicitation of dissident proxies, along with the dissemination of false and misleading statements, was made to a number of Company shareholders holding substantial voting power. No dissident proxy was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required under their rules and regulations.\n\nThis belief is premised upon preliminary information received by the Company from certain of these shareholders. Based on this information, the Company believes that a former Officer and Director of the Company, who was previously removed by the Company shareholders, was one of the primary dissident parties directing the unlawful acts (“Dissident Actors”).\n\nThe Company believes the dissident solicitation appears to have negatively affected the results of Item 3 Approval of the Stock Option Plan and Item 4 the Reverse Stock Split Proposal (“Compromised Proposals”). The Company believes the Dissident Actors ostensibly urged a number of shareholders holding a substantial number of votes to oppose the Compromised Proposals.\n\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company informed its Board of Directors of the dissident solicitation and a meeting of the Board of Directors was called to order. The Board of Directors authorized a full investigation of the matter, directly and through independent counsel. Once the investigation is concluded, the Company will consider its appropriate actions, especially those relating to maintaining its listing status. However, the Company intends to seek full redress under Wyoming and federal securities laws against all responsible parties, including through litigation if warranted.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. \n\n**BioNexus Gene Lab Corp.**  \n---  \nDate: October 10, 2024| By:| _/s/ Su-Leng Tan Lee_  \nName: | Su-Leng Tan Lee  \nTitle: | Chief Executive Officer  \n4  \n---\n"

You may vote your shares by proxy prior to the Annual Meeting by following the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card.\n\n_Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name._ If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee or custodian, then you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, which are held in “street name.” In this case, your proxy materials have been forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization as to how to vote the shares held in your account by following the instructions contained on the voting instruction card provided to you by that organization.\n\n**Voting**\n\nOur outstanding Common Stock is the only class of securities entitled to vote on the proposals presented at the Annual Meeting.

The list will also be available online during the Annual Meeting at https://onlineproxyvote.com/BGLC/2024. As of the Record Date, there were 17,967,663 shares of Common Stock outstanding and approximately 310 holders of record, according to information provided by our transfer agent. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each proposal. One-third of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as present for establishing a quorum but will not be counted as votes cast. If a quorum is not present, the meeting may be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.\n\n4  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nAll votes will be tabulated by our inspector of elections for the Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and “broker non-votes” (_i.e._ , shares held by a broker or other nominee having discretionary power to vote on some matters but not others). Broker non-votes occur when your broker or other nominee submits a proxy for your shares (because the broker or other nominee has received instructions from you on one or more proposals, but not all, or has not received instructions from you but is entitled to vote your shares on a particular “discretionary” matter) but does not indicate a vote for a particular proposal because the broker or other nominee either does not have the authority to vote on that proposal and has not received voting instructions from you, or has discretionary authority but chooses not to exercise it. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. However, because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on each proposal, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with the two proposals. \n\n**Vote Required for Each Proposal**\n\nThe voting requirements for each of the Proposals under consideration at the Annual Meeting to be approved, and the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes on each Proposal, are as follows:\n\n**Proposal** |  **Voting Approval Standard** |  **Effect of Abstentions** |  **Effect of Broker Non-Votes (1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nElection of Directors |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nRatification of Auditor |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nApproval of 2024 Stock Incentive Plan |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nReverse Stock Split Proposal |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nAdjournment Proposal |  One-third of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote |  Same effect as a vote against |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \n(1) |  Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on each of the above proposals, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with these two proposals.  \n---|---  \n  \n**How to Vote**\n\nThe manner in which your shares may be voted depends on how your shares are held.

The Board has not appointed a lead independent director. Due to the size of the Board, the independent directors are able to closely monitor the activities of our Company. In addition, the independent directors are able to meet independently with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm without management to discuss the Company’s financial statements and related audits. Therefore, the Board has determined that a lead independent director is not necessary at this time. To the extent the composition of the Board changes and/or grows in the future, the Board may reevaluate the need for a lead independent director.\n\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the Company faces, while the Board as a whole has ultimate responsibility for the Company’s oversight of risk management. Our Board takes an enterprise-wide approach to risk oversight, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance stockholder value. A fundamental part of risk oversight is not only understanding the risks a Company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. As a critical part of this risk management oversight role, our Board encourages full and open communication between management and the Board. Our Board regularly reviews material strategic, operational, financial, compensation and compliance risks with management. In addition our management team regularly reports to the full Board regarding their areas of responsibility and a component of these reports is risk within the area of responsibility and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Additional review or reporting on risk is conducted as needed or as requested by our Board.\n\nAttendance\n\nThere were 4 meetings, exclusive of action by unanimous written consent, of the Board held during fiscal year 2023. During such year, Mr. Yap, as the only incumbent director, attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board. The Company did not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in fiscal year 2023 and instead the Company’s directors were elected by written consent of the shareholders. We encourage our directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nThere were 2 meetings each, exclusive of action by unanimous written consent, of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Compensation Committee held during fiscal year 2023. The Company expects that each incumbent director will attend at least 75% of the meetings.\n\n**Board Diversity Matrix**\n\nThe following chart summarizes certain self-identified personal characteristics of our Directors, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(f).\n\n12  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nEach term used in the table has the meaning given to it in the rule and related instructions.\n\n**Board Diversity Matrix (As of September 4, 2024)**  \n---  \n**Board Size:**  \nTotal Number of Directors |  5  \n**Female** |  **Male** |  **Non-Binary** |  **Did Not**  \n**Disclose Gender**  \n**Gender:**  \nDirectors |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0  \n**Number of Directors who identify in Any of the Categories Below:**  \nAfrican American or Black |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nAlaskan Native or Native American |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nAsian (other than South Asian) |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0  \nSouth Asian |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nHispanic or Latinx |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nWhite |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nLGBTQ+ |  0  \nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background |  0  \n  \n**Vote Required**\n\nDirectors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, with the five nominees obtaining the greatest number of affirmative votes being elected as Directors, even if less than a majority.

Subject to the provisions of the Incentive Plan, the Committee determines the persons to whom grants of options, including but not limited to Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”), shares of restricted stock and other stock-based awards are to be made, the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each grant and all other terms and conditions of the grant. If an option is granted, the Committee determines whether the option is an incentive stock option or a nonstatutory stock option, the option’s term, vesting and exercisability, the amount and type of consideration to be paid to our company upon the option’s exercise and the other terms and conditions of the grant. The terms and conditions of restricted stock and SAR Awards are also determined by the Committee. The Committee has the responsibility to interpret the Incentive Plan and to make determinations with respect to all Awards granted under the Incentive Plan. All determinations of the Committee are final and binding on all persons having an interest in the Incentive Plan or in any Award made under the Incentive Plan. The costs and expenses of administering the Incentive Plan are borne by the Company.\n\n16  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_**Eligibility**_\n\nEligible individuals include our and our subsidiaries’ employees (including our and our subsidiaries’ officers and directors who are also employees), independent directors, advisor or consultants whose efforts, in the judgment of the Committee, are deemed worthy of encouragement to promote our growth and success. Non-employee directors of our Board are also eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan. All eligible individuals may receive one or more Awards under the Plan, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Incentive Plan. There is no assurance that an otherwise eligible individual will be selected by the Committee to receive an Award under the Incentive Plan. Because future Awards under the Incentive Plan will be granted in the discretion of the Committee, the type, number, recipients and other terms of such Awards cannot be determined at this time.\n\n_**Stock Options and SARs**_\n\nUnder the Incentive Plan, the Committee is authorized to grant both stock options and SARs. Stock options may be either designated as non-qualified stock options or incentive stock options. Incentive stock options, which are intended to meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code such that a participant can receive potentially favorable tax treatment, may only be granted to employees. Therefore, any stock option granted to consultants and non-employee directors are non-qualified stock options. The tax treatment of incentive and non-qualified stock options is generally described later in this summary. SARs may be granted either alone or in tandem with stock options. A SAR entitles the participant to receive the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share on the exercise date over the strike price of the SAR. This amount is payable in cash, except that the Committee may provide in an Award agreement that benefits may be paid in shares of our common stock. In general, if a SAR is granted in tandem with an option, the exercise of the option will cancel the SAR, and the exercise of the SAR will cancel the option. Any shares that are canceled will be made available for future Awards. The Committee, in its sole discretion, determines the terms and conditions of each stock option and SAR granted under the Incentive Plan, including the grant date, option or strike price (which, in no event, will be less than the par value of a share), whether a SAR is paid in cash or shares, the term of each option or SAR, exercise conditions and restrictions, conditions of forfeitures, and any other terms, conditions and restrictions consistent with the terms of the Incentive Plan, all of which will be evidenced in an individual Award agreement between us and the participant.\n\nCertain limitations apply to incentive stock options and SARs granted in tandem with incentive stock options. The per share exercise price of an incentive stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of the option’s grant and the term of any such option shall expire not later than the tenth anniversary of the date of the option’s grant. In addition, the per share exercise price of any option granted to a person who, at the time of the grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant and such option shall expire not later than the fifth anniversary of the date of the option’s grant.\n\nOptions and SARs granted under the Incentive Plan become exercisable at such times as may be specified by the Committee. In general, options and SARs granted to participants become exercisable in three equal annual installments, subject to the optionee’s continued employment or service with us. However, the aggregate value (determined as of the grant date) of the shares subject to incentive stock options that may become exercisable by a participant in any year may not exceed $100,000. If a SAR is granted in tandem with an option, the SAR will become exercisable at the same time or times as the option becomes exercisable.\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the Award agreement, options shall expire after a term of five years. However, the maximum term of options and SARs granted under the Incentive Plan is ten years. If any participant terminates employment due to death or disability or retirement, the portion of his or her option or SAR Awards that were exercisable at the time of such termination may be exercised for one year from the date of termination. In the case of any other termination, the portion of his or her option or SAR Awards that were exercisable at the time of such termination may be exercised for three months from the date of termination. However, if the remainder of the option or SAR term is shorter than the applicable post-termination exercise period, the participant’s rights to exercise the option or SAR will expire at the end of the term. In addition, if a participant’s service terminates due to cause, all rights under an option or SAR will immediately expire, including rights to the exercisable portion of the option or SAR. Shares attributable to an option or SAR that expire without being exercised will be forfeited by the participant and will again be available for Award under the Incentive Plan.\n\nUnless limited by the Committee in an Award agreement, payment for shares purchased pursuant to an option exercise may be made (i) in cash, check or wire transfer, (ii) subject to the Committee’s approval, in shares already owned by the participant (including restricted shares held by the participant at least six months prior to the exercise of the option) valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise, or (iii) through broker-assisted cashless exercise procedures.\n\n17  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_**Restricted Stock**_\n\nUnder the Incentive Plan, the Committee is also authorized to make Awards of restricted stock. A restricted stock Award entitles the participant to all of the rights of a stockholder of our company, including the right to vote the shares and the right to receive any dividends. However, the Committee may require the payment of cash dividends to be deferred and if the Committee so determines, re-invested in additional shares of restricted stock. Before the end of a restricted period and/or lapse of other restrictions established by the Committee, shares received as restricted stock shall contain a legend restricting their transfer, and may be forfeited (i) in the event of termination of employment, (ii) if our company or the participant does not achieve specified performance goals after the grant date and before the participant’s termination of employment or (iii) upon the failure to achieve other conditions set forth in the Award agreement.\n\nAn Award of restricted stock will be evidenced by a written agreement between us and the participant. The Award agreement will specify the number of shares of our common stock subject to the Award, the nature and/or length of the restrictions, the conditions that will result in the automatic and complete forfeiture of the shares and the time and manner in which the restrictions will lapse, subject to the Award holder’s continued employment by us, and any other terms and conditions the Committee shall impose consistent with the provisions of the Incentive Plan. The Committee also determines the amount, if any, that the participant shall pay for the shares of restricted stock. However, the participant must be required to pay at least the par value for each share of restricted stock. Upon the lapse of the restrictions, any legends on the shares of our common stock subject to the Award will be re-issued to the participant without such legend.\n\nUnless the Committee determines otherwise in the Award or other agreement, if a participant terminates employment for any reason, all rights to restricted stock that are then forfeitable will be forfeited. Restricted stock that is forfeited by the participant will again be available for Award under the Incentive Plan.\n\n_**Other Stock-Based Awards**_\n\nUnder the Incentive Plane, the Committee is also authorized to grant other stock-based awards valued in whole or in part by reference to or otherwise based on stock (“Other Stock-Based Awards”), which include performance shares, convertible preferred stock (to the extent a series of preferred stock is authorized), convertible debentures, warrants, exchangeable securities and awards based of stock or options based on fair market value, book value, or performance by the Company or any subsidiary, affiliate or division. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted in tandem with other Awards under the Incentive Plan.\n\nOther Stock-Based Awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered prior to the date to which the stock is issued or, if later, the date on which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period lapses. The recipient of an Other Stock-Based Award, subject to the terms of the grant agreement, is entitled to interest or dividends with respect to the number of shares covered by their Other Stock-Based Award.\n\n_**Change in Control Provisions**_\n\nIn the event of a change in control of the Company, and except as otherwise set forth in the applicable grant agreement, all unvested portions of Awards shall vest immediately. Awards, whether or not then vested, shall be continued, assumed, or have new rights as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and restrictions to which any shares of Restricted Stock or any other Award granted prior to the change in control are subject shall not lapse. Awards shall, where appropriate at the Committee’s discretion, receive the same distribution of the Company’s common stock on such terms as determined by the Committee. Upon a change in control, the Committee may also provide for the purchase of any Awards for an amount of cash per share of common stock issuable under the Award equal to the excess of the highest price per share of the Company’s common stock paid in any transaction related to a change in control of the Company over the exercise price of such Award.\n\n18  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_**Fair Market Value**_\n\nUnder the Incentive Plan, fair market value means the fair market value of the shares based upon (i) the closing selling price of a share of our common stock as quoted on the principal national securities exchange on which the stock is traded, if the stock is then traded on a national securities exchange, or (ii) the closing bid price per share last quoted on that date by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the common stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange.\n\n_**Transferability Restrictions**_\n\nGenerally and unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, shares or rights subject to an Award cannot be assigned or transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and Awards may be exercised during the participant’s lifetime only by the participant or his or her guardian or legal representative. However, a participant may, if permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, transfer an Award, or any portion thereof, to one or more of the participant’s spouse, children or grandchildren, or may designate in writing a beneficiary to exercise an Award after his or her death.\n\n_**Clawback Policy**_\n\nAll awards granted under the Incentive Plan are subject to the terms of any Company potential forfeiture, incentive compensation recoupment, clawback, or similar actions. The Awards are also subject to policies established by the Company, such as anti-hedging or pledging policies. These policies and shall include, without limitation, (i) any Company policy established to comply with applicable laws (including, without limitation, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), and/or (ii) the rules and regulations of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the shares of Stock or other securities are listed or quoted, and these requirements shall be deemed incorporated by reference into all outstanding Award Agreements.\n\n_**Termination or Amendment of the Incentive Plan**_\n\nUnless sooner terminated, no Awards may be granted under the Incentive Plan after May 17, 2034. Our Board may amend or terminate the Incentive Plan at any time, but our Board may not, without stockholder approval, amend the Incentive Plan to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance of Awards. In addition, any amendment or modification of the Incentive Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval as required by any securities exchange on which our common stock is listed. No amendment or termination may deprive any participant of any rights under Awards previously made under the Incentive Plan.\n\n_**Summary of Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Incentive Plan**_\n\nThe following summary is intended only as a general guide as to the federal income tax consequences under current United States law with respect to participation in the Incentive Plan and does not attempt to describe all possible federal or other tax consequences of such participation. Furthermore, the tax consequences of awards made under the Incentive Plan are complex and subject to change, and a taxpayer’s particular situation may be such that some variation of the described rules is applicable.\n\n_Options and SARS._ There are three points in time when a participant and our company could potentially incur federal income tax consequences: date of grant, upon exercise and upon disposition. First, when an option or a SAR is granted to a participant, the participant does not recognize any income for federal income tax purposes on the date of grant. We similarly do not have any federal income tax consequences at the date of grant. Second, depending upon the type of option, the exercise of an option may or may not result in the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes. With respect to an incentive stock option, a participant will not recognize any ordinary income upon the option’s exercise (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply). However, a participant will generally recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option. In this case, the participant will recognize income equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of shares purchased pursuant to the option on the date of exercise. With respect to the exercise of a SAR, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the cash received (or, if applicable, value of the shares received).\n\n19  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nIncentive stock options are subject to certain holding requirements before a participant can dispose of the shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of the option and receive capital gains treatment on any income realized from the exercise of the option. Satisfaction of the holding periods determines the tax treatment of any income realized upon exercise. If a participant disposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option before the end of the applicable holding periods (called a “disqualifying disposition”), the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise of the incentive stock option minus the exercise price or (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares minus the exercise price. Any excess of the fair market value on the date of such disposition over the fair market value on the date of exercise must be recognized as capital gains by the participant. If a participant disposes of shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option after the applicable holding periods have expired, such disposition generally will result in long-term capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the sale price and the participant’s tax “basis” in such shares (generally, in such case, the tax “basis” is the exercise price).\n\nGenerally, we will be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant in connection with the exercise of options and SARs. However, we are generally not entitled to a tax deduction relating to amounts that represent capital gains to a participant. Accordingly, if the participant satisfies the requisite holding period with respect to an incentive stock option before disposition to receive the favorable tax treatment accorded incentive stock options, we will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to an incentive stock option. In the event the participant has a disqualifying disposition with respect to an incentive stock option, we will be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the amount that the participant recognized as ordinary income.\n\n_Restricted Stock Awards._ A participant will not be required to recognize any income for federal income tax purposes upon the grant of shares of restricted stock. With respect to Awards involving shares or other property, such as restricted stock Awards, that contain restrictions as to their transferability and are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares or other property received at the time the shares or other property become transferable or are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs first. We generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. A participant may elect to be taxed at the time he or she receives shares (e.g., restricted stock) or other property rather than upon the lapse of transferability restrictions or the substantial risk of forfeiture. However, if the participant subsequently forfeits such shares he or she would not be entitled to any tax deduction or, to recognize a loss, for the value of the shares or property on which he or she previously paid tax. Alternatively, if an Award that results in a transfer to the participant of cash, shares or other property does not contain any restrictions as to their transferability and is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or the fair market value of shares or other property actually received. We generally will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount.\n\n**Required Vote of Stockholders**\n\nThe approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal requires that a quorum exist and that the number of votes cast in favor of approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal exceeds the number of votes cast against approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal. Brokers are not permitted to vote shares held for a customer on “non-routine” matters (such as the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal) without specific instructions from the customer. Therefore, broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will also have no effect on the outcome of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal.\n\n**Interests of Directors and Executive Officers**\n\nOur directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this proposal except to the extent of their ownership of shares of our Common Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of our Board**\n\n**THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL 3 TO APPROVE OF THE 2024 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AND THE FORM, TERMS AND PROVISIONS.**\n\n20  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**PROPOSAL 4**\n\n**REVERSE STOCK SPLIT PROPOSAL:**\n\n**APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO**\n\n**THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT**\n\n**THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT**\n\n**Background**\n\nOn September 4, 2024, subject to stockholder approval, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an amendment (the “Charter Amendment”) to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our “Charter”) to, at the discretion of the Board, effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a ratio of 1:2 to 1:10 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), with the exact ratio within such range to be determined by the Board at its discretion. The primary goal of the Reverse Stock Split is to increase the per share market price of our Common Stock to meet the minimum per share bid price requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and to provide additional flexibility with respect to capital raising efforts and general corporate needs. We believe that a range of Reverse Stock Split ratios provides us with the most flexibility to achieve the desired results of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a “going private transaction” covered by Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Reverse Stock Split is not intended to modify the rights of existing stockholders in any material respect.\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Reverse Stock Split is effected, up to every 10 shares of our outstanding Common Stock would be combined and reclassified into one share of Common Stock. The actual timing for implementation of the Reverse Stock Split would be determined by the Board based upon its evaluation as to when such action would be most advantageous to the Company and our stockholders. Notwithstanding approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal by our stockholders, the Board will have the sole authority to elect whether or not and when to amend our Charter to effect the Reverse Stock Split. If the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by our stockholders, the Board will make a determination as to whether effecting the Reverse Stock Split is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders in light of, among other things, the Company’s ability to increase the trading price of our Common Stock to meet the minimum stock price standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) without effecting the Reverse Stock Split, the per share price of the Common Stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, the expected stability of the per share price of the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split and the need to increase flexibility with respect to potential capital raising efforts. If the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to effect the Reverse Stock Split, it will convene to determine the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split. For additional information concerning the factors the Board will consider in deciding whether to effect the Reverse Stock Split, see below under the headings “Determination of the Reverse Stock Split Ratio” and “Board Discretion to Effect the Reverse Stock Split.”\n\nThe text of the proposed Charter Amendment to effect the Reverse Stock Split is included as  _Annex B_ to this Proxy Statement. If the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by the Company’s stockholders, the Company will have the authority to file the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming, which will become effective upon its filing; provided, however, that the Charter Amendment is subject to revision to include such changes as may be required by the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming and as the Board deems necessary and advisable. The Board has determined that the Charter Amendment is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has submitted the Charter Amendment for consideration by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting.\n\n**Purpose and Effect of the Reverse Stock Split and Charter Amendment**\n\nWe are submitting this proposal to our stockholders for approval in order to increase the trading price of our Common Stock to meet the minimum per share bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and to give the Company additional flexibility with respect to capital raising efforts. We believe increasing the trading price of our Common Stock may assist in our capital-raising efforts by making our Common Stock more attractive to a broader range of investors. The Board also believes that some potential employees are less likely to work for the Company if we have a low stock price or are no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, irrespective of the size of our overall market capitalization. \n\n21  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nAdditionally, since we are not adjusting the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue, the Reserve Stock Split will have the benefit of increasing the number of shares of Common Stock the Company has the ability to issue. Currently, as of the Record Date, the Company has 300,000,000 authorized shares of Common Stock, of which 17,967,663 are currently issued and outstanding and 115,000of which are reserved for issuance under outstanding equity awards or convertible securities or otherwise reserved for issuance of Underwriter’s Warrants or under our equity incentive plan. Therefore, the Company currently has the ability to issue only 115,000additional shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date. Accordingly, we believe that the Reverse Stock Split is in our stockholders’ best interests.\n\n_**Nasdaq Requirement for Continued Listing**_. On the date of the mailing of this proxy statement, our Common Stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BGLC.” On November 6, 2023, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq stating that the Company did not satisfy the continued listing requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of common stock, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”), as the Company’s closing bid price was less than $1.00 per share for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Nasdaq letter. The Company was given a compliance period of 180 calendar days which was extended for an additional 180 days, or until November 4, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We believe that the Reverse Stock Split, if necessary, is currently our best option to meet the criteria to satisfy the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On September 4, 2024, the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $0.4326 per share. A decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from the Reverse Stock Split should, absent other factors, cause the per share market price of our Common Stock to trade above the required price. However, we cannot provide any assurance that (i) we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or other listing requirements, of the Nasdaq Capital Market or (ii) even if we do, that our minimum bid price would remain over the Minimum Bid Price Requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market following the Reverse Stock Split. We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\n_**Increased Credibility and Investor Interest**_. In addition, as noted above, we believe that the Reverse Stock Split and the resulting anticipated increase in the per share price of our Common Stock could encourage increased investor interest in our Common Stock and promote greater liquidity for our stockholders. The Board believes that continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market provides overall credibility to an investment in our stock, given the stringent listing and disclosure requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, we cannot provide assurance that our Common Stock would be listed on another national securities exchange, a national quotation service, the over-the-counter markets or the pink sheets. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even the issuance of a notice of potential delisting, could also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of our securities, decrease securities analysts’ coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence. \n\nA greater price per share of our Common Stock could allow a broader range of institutions to invest in our Common Stock (namely, funds that are prohibited or discouraged from buying stocks with a price below a certain threshold), potentially increasing marketability, trading volume and liquidity of our Common Stock. Many institutional investors view stocks trading at low prices as unduly speculative in nature and, as a result, avoid investing in such stocks. We believe that the Reverse Stock Split will provide flexibility to make our Common Stock a more attractive investment for these institutional investors, which we believe will enhance the liquidity for the holders of our Common Stock and may facilitate future sales of our Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split could also increase interest in our Common Stock for analysts and brokers who may otherwise have policies that discourage or prohibit them in following or recommending companies with low stock prices. Additionally, because brokers’ commissions on transactions in low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, the current average price per share of our Common Stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were substantially higher.\n\n22  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_**Ability to meet Present Capital Needs and Future Anticipated Growth.**_ As discussed below under the heading “Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on the Number of Shares of Common Stock Available for Future Issuance” the Reverse Stock Split will have the effect of increasing the number of shares of Common Stock that we have the ability to issue. The availability of additional shares of Common Stock may provide us with the flexibility to consider and respond to future business opportunities and needs as they arise, including public or private financings, subscription rights offerings, mergers, acquisitions, stock dividends, stock splits and the granting of equity incentive awards. The Reverse Stock Split may permit us to undertake certain of the foregoing actions without the delay and expense associated with holding a meeting of stockholders to obtain stockholder approval each time such an opportunity arises that would require the issuance of shares of Common Stock.\n\nThe Board believes it is important for the Company to maintain its flexibility in accessing the equity capital markets. As we have done in the past, we intend to raise capital through equity or debt financing to fund our current operations and support growth of our products. Such additional financing could take a variety of forms, including a private investment in our Common Stock or preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, an at-the-market offering of our Common Stock, rights offering or other public offering of equity or debt securities. The availability of additional equity or debt financing will depend on the continued execution of our business plan, our ability to demonstrate a path to long-term profitable growth, as well as market conditions. There can be no assurance that such equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. \n\nThe sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our stockholders, which could be significant. The incurrence of debt financing would result in additional debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for restrictive operating and financial covenants, security interests on our assets, and other terms that could be adverse to our current stockholders and other stakeholders. Failure to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our short and long-term liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.\n\nAs previously noted, we do not intend to use the Reverse Stock Split as a part of or a first step in a “going private” transaction within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act. There is no plan or contemplated plan by us to take ourselves private at the date of this Proxy Statement.\n\n_**Employee Retention.**_ The Board believes that the Company’s employees and directors who are compensated in the form of our equity-based securities may be less incentivized and invested in the Company if we are no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Accordingly, the Board believes that maintaining Nasdaq listing qualifications for our Common Stock, can help attract, retain, and motivate employees.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Reverse Stock Split**\n\n_**The Reverse Stock Split May Not Result in an Increased Price of our Common Stock over the Medium or Long-Term**_. As notedabove one principal purpose of the Reverse Stock Split is to increase the trading price of our Common Stock tomeet the minimum stock price standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split on the market price of our Common Stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and we cannot assure you that the Reverse Stock Split will accomplish this objective for any meaningful period of time, or at all. While we expect that the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock will proportionally increase the market price of our Common Stock, we cannot assure you that the Reverse Stock Split will increase the market price of our Common Stock by a multiple of the Reverse Stock Split ratio, or result in any permanent or sustained increase in the market price of our Common Stock. The market price of our Common Stock may be affected by other factors which may be unrelated to the number of shares outstanding, including the Company’s business and financial performance, general market conditions, and prospects for future success.\n\n_**The Reverse Stock Split May Decrease the Liquidity of our Common Stock**_. The Board believes that theReverse Stock Split may result in an increase in the market price of our Common Stock, which could lead toincreased interest in our Common Stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders. However,the Reverse Stock Split will also reduce the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, which maylead to reduced trading and a smaller number of market makers for our Common Stock, particularly if the priceper share of our Common Stock does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n_**The Reverse Stock Split May Result in Some Stockholders Owning “Odd Lots” That May Be More Difficult to Sell or Require Greater Transaction Costs per Share to Sell**_.If the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, itwill increase the number of stockholders who own “odd lots” of less than 100 shares of Common Stock. Apurchase or sale of less than 100 shares of Common Stock (an “odd lot” transaction) may result in incrementallyhigher trading costs through certain brokers, particularly “full service” brokers. Therefore, those stockholderswho own fewer than 100 shares of Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split may be required to payhigher transaction costs if they sell their Common Stock.\n\n23  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_**The Reverse Stock Split May Lead to a Decrease in our Overall Market Capitalization**_.The Reverse StockSplit may be viewed negatively by the market and, consequently, could lead to a decrease in our overall marketcapitalization. If the per share market price of our Common Stock does not increase in proportion to the ReverseStock Split ratio, or following such increase does not maintain or exceed such price, then the value of ourCompany, as measured by our market capitalization, will be reduced. Additionally, any reduction in our marketcapitalization may be magnified as a result of the smaller number of total shares of Common Stock outstandingfollowing the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n**Potential Consequences if the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, our Board will not have the authority to effect the Charter Amendment to, among other things, facilitate the continued listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market by increasing the per share trading price of our Common Stock to help ensure a share price high enough to satisfy the $1.00 per share Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Any inability of our Board to effect the Reverse Stock Split could expose us to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, if we need additional capital to fund operations and at such time do not have a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock to raise such additional capital, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If stockholder approval for the Reverse Stock Split is not obtained, the number of shares of Common Stock that are issued will not change and the anticipated benefits of the Reverse Stock Split described above will not be achieved.\n\n**Treatment of Fractional Shares in the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nThe Company will not issue fractional certificates for post-reverse stock split shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares will be entitled to rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number.\n\n**Determination of the Reverse Stock Split Ratio**\n\nThe Board believes that stockholder approval of a range of potential Reverse Stock Split ratios is in the best interests of our Company and stockholders because it is not possible to predict market conditions at the time the Reverse Stock Split would be implemented. We believe that a range of Reverse Stock Split ratios provides us with the most flexibility to achieve the desired results of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split ratio to be selected by our Board will not be more than 1-for-10.\n\nThe selection of the specific Reverse Stock Split ratio will be based on several factors, including, among other things:\n\n· |  our ability to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market;  \n---|---  \n· |  the per share price of our Common Stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split;  \n· |  the expected stability of the per share price of our Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split;  \n· |  the likelihood that the Reverse Stock Split will result in increased marketability and liquidity of our Common Stock;  \n· |  prevailing market conditions;  \n· |  general economic conditions in our industry; and  \n· |  our market capitalization before, and anticipated market capitalization after, the Reverse Stock Split.  \n  \nWe believe that granting our Board the authority to set the ratio for the Reverse Stock Split is essential because it allows us to take these factors into consideration and to react to changing market conditions. If the Board chooses to implement the Reverse Stock Split, the Company will make a public announcement regarding the determination of the Reverse Stock Split ratio.\n\n**Board Discretion to Effect the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by our stockholders, the Board will have the discretion to implement the Reverse Stock Split or to not effect the Reverse Stock Split. The Board currently intends to effect the Reverse Stock Split. Even if the trading price of our Common Stock increases without effecting the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Split may not be necessary to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements, but the Board may elect to implement the Reverse Stock Split for the other reasons noted above. Following the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, there can be no assurance that the market price of our Common Stock will rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of outstanding shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split or that the market price of the post-split Common Stock can be maintained above $1.00. There also can be no assurance that our Common Stock will not be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market for other reasons.\n\n24  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nIf our stockholders approve the Reverse Stock Split Proposal at the Annual Meeting, the Reverse Stock Split will be effected, if at all, only upon a determination by the Board that the Reverse Stock Split is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at that time. No further action on the part of the stockholders will be required to either effect or abandon the Reverse Stock Split. If our Board does not implement the Reverse Stock Split prior to December 31, 2024, the authority granted in this Reverse Stock Split Proposal to implement the Reverse Stock Split will terminate and the Charter Amendment will be abandoned.\n\nThe market price of our Common Stock is dependent upon our performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. If the Reverse Stock Split is effected and the market price of our Common Stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. Furthermore, the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split could significantly reduce the trading volume and otherwise adversely affect the liquidity of our Common Stock.\n\nWe have not proposed the Reverse Stock Split in response to any effort of which we are aware to accumulate our shares of Common Stock or obtain control of the Company, nor is it a plan by management to recommend a series of similar actions to our Board or our stockholders. Notwithstanding the decrease in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split, our Board does not intend for this transaction to be the first step in a “going private transaction” within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act.\n\n**Effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split, if approved by our stockholders, will become effective upon the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming of the Charter Amendment, the form of which is attached to this proxy statement as  _Annex B_. As discussed in more detail above, the exact timing of the filing of the Charter Amendment will be determined by the Board based upon its evaluation of when such action will be most advantageous to the Company and our stockholders. The Board reserves the right, notwithstanding stockholder approval and without further action by our stockholders, to elect not to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split if, at any time prior to filing such Charter Amendment, the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The Board currently intends to effect the Reverse Stock Split. If our Board does not implement the Reverse Stock Split prior to December 31, 2024, the authority granted in this Reverse Stock Split Proposal to implement the Reverse Stock Split will terminate and the Charter Amendment will be abandoned.\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Issued and Outstanding Common Stock**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is effected, it will reduce the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, including any shares held by the Company as treasury shares, by a Reverse Stock Split ratio of 1:4 to 1:10. Accordingly, each of our stockholders will own fewer shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. However, the Reverse Stock Split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split would result in an adjustment to a stockholder’s ownership of Common Stock due to the effect of rounding up fractional shares in the Reverse Stock Split, as described in more detail above. Therefore, voting rights and other rights and preferences of the holders of Common Stock will not be affected by the Reverse Stock Split (except for the effect of rounding up fractional shares). Common Stock issued pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split will remain fully paid and nonassessable, and the par value per share of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at no value. There will be no adjustment to the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue. The number of shares of authorized Common Stock will remain at 300,000,000 shares following the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n25  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Employee Plans, Outstanding Equity Awards and Warrants to Purchase Common Stock**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is effected, the terms of all outstanding warrants currently exercisable for shares of Common Stock, and all equity awards granted under the Incentive Plan, will be proportionally adjusted to maintain their economic value, subject to adjustments for any fractional shares as described herein. In addition, the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be the subject of future grants under the Incentive Plan, as well as any plan limits on the size of such grants will be adjusted and proportionately decreased as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. As of the Record Date, 115,000 shares of our Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under outstanding warrants.\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Voting Rights**\n\nProportionate voting rights and other rights of the holders of Common Stock would not be affected by the Reverse Stock Split (except for the effect of rounding up fractional shares). For example, a holder of 1% of the voting power of the outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split would continue to hold 1% of the voting power of the outstanding Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split (except for the effect of rounding up fractional shares).\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Regulatory Matters**\n\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect our obligation to publicly file financial and other information with the SEC.\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Authorized Share Capital**\n\nThe total number of shares of capital stock that we are authorized to issue will not be affected by the Reverse Stock Split and will remain at 330,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 30,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. \n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on the Number of Shares of Common Stock Available for Future Issuance**\n\nBy reducing the number of shares outstanding without reducing the number of shares of available but unissued Common Stock, the Reverse Stock Split will increase the number of authorized but unissued shares. Although the Reverse Stock Split would not have any dilutive effect on our stockholders, the Reverse Stock Split without a reduction in the number of shares authorized for issuance would reduce the proportion of shares owned by our stockholders relative to the number of shares authorized for issuance, giving the Board an effective increase in the authorized shares available for issuance, in its discretion. \n\nAs of the Record Date, approximately 17,967,663 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of our Preferred Stock were outstanding. An additional 115,000 shares of our Common Stock have been reserved for issuance as of the Record Date. For purposes of illustration, if the Reverse Stock Split is effected at a ratio of 1:10, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split would be approximately 1,796,767 shares and the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance after the Reverse Stock Split would be approximately 11,500 shares.\n\nThe Board believes the increase is appropriate for use to fund the future operations of the Company. The Company regularly considers its capital requirements and may conduct equity offerings in the future. The Board from time to time may deem it to be in the best interests of the Company to enter into transactions and other ventures that may include the issuance of shares of our Common Stock. If the Board authorizes the issuance of additional shares subsequent to the Reverse Stock Split, the dilution to the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be greater than would occur had the Reverse Stock Split not been effected. Because our stockholders have no preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any of our unissued shares of Common Stock, the future issuance of additional shares of Common Stock will reduce our current stockholders’ percentage ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of Common Stock. In the absence of a proportionate increase in our future earnings and book value, an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of Common Stock would dilute our projected future earnings per share, if any, and book value per share of all our outstanding shares of Common Stock. If these factors were reflected in the price per share of Common Stock, the potential realizable value of a stockholder’s investment could be adversely affected. An issuance of additional shares could therefore have an adverse effect on the potential realizable value of a stockholder’s investment.\n\n26  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**Mechanics of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is approved and effected, beginning on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, each certificate representing pre-split shares will, until surrendered and exchanged as described below, for all corporate purposes, be deemed to represent, respectively, only the number of post-split shares.\n\n**Exchange of Stock Certificates**\n\nShortly after the Reverse Stock Split becomes effective, stockholders will be notified and offered the opportunity at their own expense to surrender their current certificates to our stock transfer agent, Securities Transfer Corporation, in exchange for the issuance of new certificates reflecting the Reverse Stock Split in accordance with the procedures to be set forth in a letter of transmittal to be sent by our stock transfer agent. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the CUSIP number for the common stock will change from its current CUSIP number. This new CUSIP number will appear on any new stock certificates issued representing post-split shares. **STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT** **DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY STOCK** **CERTIFICATE(S) UNLESS AND UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO FOLLOWING THE** **ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.**\n\n**Effect on Registered “Book-Entry” Holders of Common Stock**\n\nHolders of Common Stock may hold some or all of their Common Stock electronically in book-entry form (“street name”) under the direct registration system for securities. These stockholders will not have stock certificates evidencing their ownership. They are, however, provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares of Common Stock registered in their accounts. If you hold registered Common Stock in book-entry form, you do not need to take any action to receive your post-split shares, if applicable.\n\n**Appraisal Rights**\n\nUnder the Wyoming Business Corporation Act, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal or dissenter’s rights with respect to the Reverse Stock Split, and we will not independently provide our stockholders with any such rights.\n\n**Regulatory Approvals**\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split will not be consummated, if at all, until after approval of our stockholders is obtained. We are not obligated to obtain any governmental approvals or comply with any state or federal regulations in order to effect the Reverse Stock Split other than the filing of the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming.\n\n**Accounting Treatment of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is effected, the par value per share of our Common Stock will remain unchanged at no value. Accordingly, on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, the stated capital on our consolidated balance sheets attributable to our Common Stock will be reduced in proportion to the size of the Reverse Stock Split ratio, and the additional paid-in-capital account will be increased by the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. Our stockholders’ equity, in the aggregate, will remain unchanged. Per share net income or loss will be increased because there will be fewer shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any Common Stock held in treasury will be reduced in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split ratio. The Company does not anticipate that any other accounting consequences, including changes to the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any period, will arise as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n27  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations of the Reverse Stock Split applicable to U.S. holders (as defined below). This discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. holder. The effects of U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a U.S. holder. We have not sought and do not intend to seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a position contrary to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\nThis discussion is limited to U.S. holders that hold Common Stock as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax, the rules related to “qualified small business stock” within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code or the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to U.S. holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:\n\n· |  U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;  \n---|---  \n· |  U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  \n· |  Persons holding Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;  \n· |  banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;  \n· |  real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;  \n· |  brokers, dealers or traders in securities;  \n· |  corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;  \n· |  S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);  \n· |  tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;  \n· |  persons deemed to sell Common Stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;  \n· |  persons who hold or received Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; and tax-qualified retirement plans.  \n  \nIf an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding Common Stock and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.\n\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split should constitute a “recapitalization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. holder of Common Stock generally should not recognize gain or loss upon the Reverse Stock Split. A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares of Common Stock received pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split should equal the aggregate tax basis of the shares of the Common Stock surrendered, and such U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares Common Stock received should include the holding period in the shares of Common Stock surrendered. Treasury Regulations provide detailed rules for allocating the tax basis and holding period of the shares of Common Stock surrendered to the shares of Common Stock received in a recapitalization pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split. U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock acquired on different dates and at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of the tax basis and holding period of such shares.\n\nAs noted above, we will not issue fractional shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares will be automatically entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of common stock to round up to the next whole post-split share. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of such a fractional share in a Reverse Stock Split is not clear. It is possible that the receipt of such an additional fraction of a share of common stock may be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend or as an amount received in exchange for common stock. We intend to treat the issuance of such an additional fraction of a share of common stock in the Reverse Stock Split as a non-recognition event, but there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court would not successfully assert otherwise.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval and Recommendation of the Board of Directors**\n\nApproval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal requires that a majority of the votes cast on the proposal vote for approval. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1, because they are not votes cast. Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this proposal.\n\n**THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE _FOR_ PROPOSAL 4 APPROVAL TO AMEND OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.**\n\n28  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**PROPOSAL 5:**\n\n**ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL:**\n\n**APPROVAL OF AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY,**\n\n**TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES IF THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT VOTES**\n\n**IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 4**\n\n**General**\n\nIf the Annual Meeting is convened and a quorum is present, but there are not sufficient votes to approve the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, our proxy holders may move to continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting at that time in order to enable our Board to solicit additional proxies.\n\nWe are asking our stockholders to approve a proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”) to adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Reverse Stock Split Proposal at the time of the Annual Meeting. If our stockholders approve this Adjournment Proposal, we can continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting and any adjourned session of the Annual Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against the Reverse Stock Split Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to defeat the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, we could continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting without a vote on such proposals and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of such proposals.\n\nIf it is necessary to continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting, no notice of the continued, adjourned or postponed meeting is required to be given to our stockholders, other than an announcement at the Annual Meeting of the time and place to which the Annual Meeting is continued, adjourned or postponed, so long as the meeting is continued, adjourned or postponed for 30 days or less and no new record date is fixed for the continued, adjourned or postponed meeting. At the continued, adjourned or postponed meeting, we may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.\n\n**Required Vote**\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against Proposal 2 and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2. Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this proposal.\n\n**THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE _FOR_ PROPOSAL 5 APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.**\n\n29  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION**\n\n**_Summary Executive Compensation Table_**\n\nThe following table reflects the Summary Compensation for our named executive officers for fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

A person has beneficial ownership of shares if the person has the power to vote or dispose of such shares. This power can be exclusive or shared, direct or indirect. In addition, a person is considered by SEC rules to beneficially own shares underlying options and convertible securities that are presently exercisable or convertible or will become exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the date that beneficial ownership is calculated. Unless otherwise indicated the address of each beneficial owner is c/o BioNexus Gene Lab Corp., Unit A-28-7, Tower A, Menara UOA Bangsar, No.5 Jln Bangsar Utama 1, 59000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” is intended to provide extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.\n\nFor the Annual Meeting, a number of brokers with account holders who are Company stockholders will be “householding” our proxy materials. This means a single copy of the proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, you may (1) if you are not a stockholder of record, notify your broker, or (2) if you are a stockholder of record, direct your written request to Investor Relations, BioNexus Gene Lab Corp., Unit A-28-7, Tower A, Menara UOA Bangsar, No.5 Jln Bangsar Utama 1, 59000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia or your oral request to the Company at +60 3 86796680. If you currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at your address and would like to request “householding” of these communications, please contact your broker if you are not a stockholder of record; or contact our Investor Relations department if you are a stockholder of record, using the contact information provided above.\n\n**OTHER MATTERS**\n\nWe know of no other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the proxies will be voted by the persons named therein in accordance with their judgment on such matters. Discretionary authority with respect to such other matters is granted by a stockholder’s submission of their proxy.\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\nWe file annual and quarterly reports and other reports and information with the SEC.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate from time to time those Eligible Individuals to whom Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options, or both, shall be granted and the number of Shares to be granted to each such Eligible Individual; provided, however, that only Key Employees may receive Incentive Stock Options and the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the shares with respect to which any incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by any Key Employee during any calendar year under all incentive stock option plans of the Corporation and any Subsidiary shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or such other limit set forth in Section 422 of the Code (the “Limitations of the Code”). If the aggregate fair market value of such shares exceeds the Limitations of the Code, the excess Shares will be treated as Non-qualified Options under this Plan. In reducing the number of Incentive Stock Options to meet the Limitations of the Code, the most recently granted Incentive Stock Options shall be reduced first. If a reduction of simultaneously granted Options is necessary to meet the Limitations of the Code, the Committee may designate which Shares are to be treated as Shares acquired pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option. In the event that any Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan fail to meet the requirements for Incentive Stock Options as set forth in the Code, such Incentive Stock Options will be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options under the Plan. In determining the Eligible Individuals who will be granted Options under the Plan, the Committee may consider such individuals’ responsibilities, service, present and future value to the Corporation or any Subsidiary and other factors it considers relevant.\n\n**2.2 Terms and Conditions of Options**. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary or in an Award Agreement, each Option shall be subject to the following express terms and conditions and to such other terms and conditions as the Committee may deem appropriate as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary:\n\n(a) Option Term. Each Option shall expire on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Grant Date or on such earlier date as may be specified in the Participant’s Award Agreement or employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary. The Committee may extend such Option Term; provided, however, that (i) such extension shall not in any way disqualify the Option as an Incentive Stock Option and (ii) the Option Term, including any such extensions, shall not exceed ten (10) years. The Option Term of Incentive Stock Options granted to 10% Owners shall not exceed five (5) years.\n\nA-6  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n(b) Option Price. The Option Price per Share shall be determined by the Committee no later than the Grant Date of any Option; provided, however, (i) the Option Price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, and (ii) in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a 10% Owner, the Option Price shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date (but in no event less than the par value of a Share). The Option Price may be denominated in U.S. Dollars, Chinese Renminbi or other local currency as determined by the Committee.\n\n(c) Exercise of Option. The exercisability of an Option shall be determined by the Committee. Subject to acceleration or early expiration as provided elsewhere in the Plan or in a Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the vesting of any Option granted under the Plan shall be subject to the Participant remaining in the employ of or maintaining a consultancy with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and shall vest (i) in five (5) equal installments of twenty percent (20%) of the amount granted, with the first installment vesting on the March 31 next following the Grant Date and each other installment vesting on each of the next four March 31 dates thereafter or (ii) in such other amounts over such period of time after the Grant Date as the Committee may designate.\n\n(d) Disqualifying Disposition.

Upon such demand, delivery of such representation prior to the delivery of any Common Stock issued upon exercise of an Option and prior to the expiration of the Option Term shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Participant or such other person to purchase any Common Stock. In the event certificates for Common Stock are delivered under the Plan with respect to which such an investment representation has been obtained, the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on such certificates to make appropriate reference to such representations and to restrict transfer in the absence of compliance with applicable federal, state or other governmental securities laws.\n\n(i) Participants to Have No Rights as Shareholders.

The benefit for each SAR shall be equal to (x) the Fair Market Value of the Share on the date of such exercise, minus (y) the Strike Price of such SAR. Such benefit shall be payable in cash (subject to applicable withholding), except that the Committee may provide in the applicable Award Agreement that benefits may be paid wholly or partly in Shares.\n\n**3.5 No Rights as Shareholders**.

However, the Committee may, if it, in its sole discretion, determines that the circumstances warrant such action, approve the release of all or any part of the Restricted Stock that would otherwise be forfeited pursuant to this Section, upon such conditions as it shall determine.\n\n(ii) Upon Termination Due to Death. If a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or a Subsidiary is terminated due to death, all Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan which are then subject to a Restricted Period or other Restrictions and which would have been released, if the Participant had not died, within the calendar year following the Participant’s death shall be released on the date of such termination as if with respect to such Shares the Restricted Period had ended and the other Restrictions had lapsed and certificates representing such Shares of Restricted Stock shall be delivered to the Participant’s Beneficiary or legal representative free from such Restrictions as soon as practicable following such termination and all other Shares of Restricted Stock that would not have been released, if the Participant had not died, within the calendar year following the Participant’s death will be forfeited and become the property of the Corporation on the date of such termination.\n\n**4.6 Section 83(b) Elections**.

Participants shall have no right, title or interest whatsoever in or to any investments which the Corporation may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation and any Participant, Beneficiary, legal representative or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Corporation under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Corporation. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Corporation and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan; provided, however , that in its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or pay cash; provided, further, however, that, unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of the affected Participant, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the “unfunded” status of the Plan.\n\n**7.2 Certain Adjustments to Shares**.

Any adjustment of an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to this Section shall be made only to the extent not constituting a “modification” within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code, unless the holder of such Option shall agree otherwise. The Committee shall give notice to each Participant of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section and, upon notice, such adjustment shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.\n\nA-12  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_DEF14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**7.3 Successor Corporation**.

The last such designation received by the Committee shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participant’s death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt.\n\n**7.9 Payments to Persons Other Than A Participant**. If the Committee shall find that any person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any payment due to such person or his or her estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may, if the Committee so directs the Corporation, be paid to his or her spouse, a child, a relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of such person, or any other person deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Committee and the Corporation therefor. \n\n**7.10 Designated Participants**.\n\n(a) If the Committee determines in its sole discretion that an appointment is necessary or desirable to comply with the regulatory requirements in Malaysia, it may appoint the Corporation, a Subsidiary or any other institution or organization registered outside of Malaysia (a “Trustee”) to hold the interest and exercise the rights granted under the Plan of any Participant (a “Designated Participant”) who either is a national of and ordinary resident in Malaysia or is otherwise designated by the Committee as a Designated Participant.

This expansion will position Chemrex closer to key markets, enhancing its ability to respond to regional demand efficiently and cost-effectively. These new factories will replicate the successful production model being rolled out in Malaysia.\n\n**Synergy Through Bulk Purchasing:**\n\nChemrex will also leverage **bulk purchasing** of raw materials to drive **synergy effects**. By acquiring materials in larger volumes, the Company will benefit from economies of scale, leading to lower production costs.

If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Securities Transfer Corporation, then you are considered the “stockholder of record” of those shares. In this case, your printed proxy materials have been sent to you directly by us. You may vote your shares by proxy prior to the Annual Meeting by following the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card.\n\n_Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name._ If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee or custodian, then you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, which are held in “street name.” In this case, your proxy materials have been forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization as to how to vote the shares held in your account by following the instructions contained on the voting instruction card provided to you by that organization.\n\n**Voting**\n\nOur outstanding Common Stock is the only class of securities entitled to vote on the proposals presented at the Annual Meeting. Common Stockholders of record on the Record Date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. A complete list of registered stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for inspection at the principal executive offices of the Company during regular business hours for the 10 calendar days prior to the Annual Meeting. The list will also be available online during the Annual Meeting at www.**[*]**. As of the Record Date, there were 17,967,663 shares of Common Stock outstanding and approximately 310 holders of record, according to information provided by our transfer agent. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each proposal. One-third of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as present for establishing a quorum but will not be counted as votes cast. If a quorum is not present, the meeting may be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.\n\n4  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nAll votes will be tabulated by our inspector of elections for the Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and “broker non-votes” (_i.e._ , shares held by a broker or other nominee having discretionary power to vote on some matters but not others). Broker non-votes occur when your broker or other nominee submits a proxy for your shares (because the broker or other nominee has received instructions from you on one or more proposals, but not all, or has not received instructions from you but is entitled to vote your shares on a particular “discretionary” matter) but does not indicate a vote for a particular proposal because the broker or other nominee either does not have the authority to vote on that proposal and has not received voting instructions from you, or has discretionary authority but chooses not to exercise it. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. However, because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on each proposal, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with the two proposals. \n\n**Vote Required for Each Proposal**\n\nThe voting requirements for each of the Proposals under consideration at the Annual Meeting to be approved, and the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes on each Proposal, are as follows:\n\n**Proposal** |  **Voting Approval Standard** |  **Effect of Abstentions** |  **Effect of Broker Non-Votes (1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nElection of Directors |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nRatification of Auditor |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nApproval of 2024 Stock Incentive Plan |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nReverse Stock Split Proposal |  One-third of the votes cast on the proposal |  No effect – not counted as a vote |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \nAdjournment Proposal |  One-third of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote |  Same effect as a vote against |  No effect – not counted as a vote  \n(1) |  Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on each of the above proposals, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with these two proposals.  \n---|---  \n  \n**How to Vote**\n\nThe manner in which your shares may be voted depends on how your shares are held. If you are a stockholder of record, meaning that your shares are represented by certificates or book entries in your name so that you appear as a stockholder on the records of Securities Transfer Corporation, our stock transfer agent, you may vote by proxy, meaning you authorize the individuals named on your proxy card or Notice to vote your shares. If you choose to vote by proxy, you may do so by telephone, via the Internet or by mail. Each of these methods is explained below. **If you hold your shares of Common Stock in multiple accounts, you should vote your shares as described in each set of proxy materials you receive.** You also may participate in and vote during the Annual Meeting. \n\n_Voting by proxy._ You may vote your shares by proxy by telephone, via the Internet or by mail:\n\n· |  _By Telephone_. You may transmit your proxy voting instructions by calling the telephone number specified on the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. You will need to have the proxy card in hand when you call. If you choose to vote by telephone, you do not have to return a proxy card by mail.  \n---|---  \n· |  _Via the Internet_. You may transmit your proxy voting instructions via the Internet by following the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. You will need to have the proxy card in hand when you access the website. If you choose to vote via the Internet, you do not have to return a proxy card by mail.  \n· |  _By Mail_. You may vote by proxy by completing, signing and dating the proxy card enclosed with your printed proxy materials and returning it in the enclosed prepaid envelope.  \n5  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_Voting online during the Annual Meeting:_ Stockholders who elect to participate in the Annual Meeting may vote online during the Annual Meeting by following the instructions provided. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote your shares by proxy in advance of the Annual Meeting so that if you should become unable to attend the Annual Meeting your shares will still be voted in accordance with your direction.\n\nTelephone and Internet voting for stockholders of record will be available up until the conclusion of the Annual Meeting, and mailed proxy cards must be received by October 2, 2024 in order to be counted at the Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is adjourned or postponed, this deadline may be extended.\n\nThe voting deadlines and availability of telephone and Internet voting for beneficial owners of shares held in “street name” will depend on the voting processes of the organization that holds your shares. Therefore, we urge you to carefully review and follow the voting instruction card and any other materials that you receive from that organization.\n\n**Revoking a Proxy; Changing Your Vote**\n\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the meeting:\n\n· |  by submitting a new proxy with a later date before the Annual Meeting either signed and returned by mail or transmitted using the telephone or Internet voting procedures described in the “How to Vote” section above;  \n---|---  \n· |  by voting online at the virtual meeting site; or  \n· |  by filing a written revocation with our corporate Secretary.  \n  \nIf your shares are held in “street name,” you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker or other organization holding your account. You may also vote online at the Annual Meeting, which will have the effect of revoking any previously submitted voting instructions, if you obtain a legal proxy from the organization that holds your shares as described in the “How to Vote” section above.\n\nYour attendance alone at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy.\n\n**Solicitation**\n\nThe proxies being solicited for the Annual Meeting as described in this Proxy Statement are being solicited by the Company's Board of Directors. We will pay all of the costs of soliciting proxies. We will provide copies of our proxy materials to brokerage firms, fiduciaries and custodians for forwarding to beneficial owners who request printed copies of these materials and will reimburse these persons for their costs of forwarding these materials. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile or personal solicitation; however, we will not pay them additional compensation for any of these services. \n\n**Deadlines for Receipt of Stockholder Proposals**\n\nStockholders may present proposals for action at a future meeting only if they comply with the requirements of the proxy rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and our Bylaws. For stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) to be presented at and included in our proxy statement for our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2025 Annual Meeting”), such proposals must have been submitted to and received by the Company’s corporate Secretary no later than [*], 2024.

Under our Bylaws, the deadline for submitting a nomination for a director to be included in our proxy materials for an annual meeting is 60 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under the Bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company’s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act. In addition, the proxy solicited by the Board of Directors for the 2025 Annual Meeting will confer discretionary authority to vote on any stockholder proposal presented at that meeting, unless we receive notice of such proposal no later than [*], 2024, which is 45 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of the proxy statement related to our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. Stockholder proposals and nominations must be in writing and should be addressed to our corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices located at Unit A-28-7, Tower A, Menara UOA Bangsar, No.5 Jln Bangsar Utama 1, 59000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Subsequently the candidates will be evaluated to ensure they possess these key characteristics –\n\n· |  a commitment to long-term value creation for our stockholders;  \n---|---  \n· |  an appreciation for stockholder feedback;  \n· |  high personal and professional ethics;  \n· |  a proven record of success;  \n· |  sound business judgment;  \n· |  a strategic vision and leadership experience;  \n· |  knowledge of financial services;  \n· |  having no known history of misconduct or disrepute, especially in public or Corporate office;  \n10  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nThe Company does not currently pay any third parties to aid it in identifying director candidates.\n\nAll members are independent directors in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n\n**Compensation Committee**\n\nOur Board of Directors also has a Compensation Committee, which reviews or recommends the compensation arrangements for our management and employees and assists the Board of Directors in reviewing and approving matters such as company benefit and insurance plans, including monitoring the performance thereof. The Compensation Committee has a charter (which is reviewed annually) and is composed of two members: Chee Keong Yap and Muhammad Azrul bin Abdul Hamid. Mr. Muhammad Azrul bin Abdul Hamid serves as chairman of this committee. All members are independent in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for:\n\nevaluating the performance of our Chief Executive Officer in light of our company’s corporate goals and objectives and, based on such evaluation: (i) Reviewing and approving the cash compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, and (ii) Reviewing and approving grants and awards to our Chief Executive Officer under equity-based plans;\n\n· |  reviewing and recommending to the Board of Directors the cash compensation of our other executive officers;  \n---|---  \n· |  reviewing and establishing our overall management compensation, philosophy and policy;  \n· |  overseeing and administering our compensation and similar plans;  \n· |  reviewing and approving the retention or termination of any consulting firm or outside advisor to assist in the evaluation of compensation matters and evaluating and assessing potential and current compensation advisors in accordance with the independence standards identified in the applicable Nasdaq rules;  \n· |  retaining and approving the compensation of any compensation advisors;  \n· |  reviewing and approving our policies and procedures for the grant of equity-based awards;  \n· |  reviewing and recommending to the board of directors the compensation of our directors; and  \n· |  preparing the compensation committee report required by SEC rules, if and when required.  \n  \nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any of its responsibilities to one or more subcommittees as the Committee may from time to time deem appropriate. If at any time the Compensation Committee includes a member who is not independent as defined under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, a subcommittee comprised entirely of individuals who are independent in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules may be formed by the Compensation Committee for the purpose of ratifying any grants of awards under any incentive or equity-based plan for the purposes of complying with the exemption requirements of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; provided that any such grants shall not be contingent on such ratification. No compensation consultants were used during fiscal year 2023.\n\n11  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n_Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight_\n\nOur Board currently consists of five directors. The Board has not appointed a lead independent director. Due to the size of the Board, the independent directors are able to closely monitor the activities of our Company. In addition, the independent directors are able to meet independently with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm without management to discuss the Company’s financial statements and related audits. Therefore, the Board has determined that a lead independent director is not necessary at this time. To the extent the composition of the Board changes and/or grows in the future, the Board may reevaluate the need for a lead independent director.\n\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the Company faces, while the Board as a whole has ultimate responsibility for the Company’s oversight of risk management. Our Board takes an enterprise-wide approach to risk oversight, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance stockholder value. A fundamental part of risk oversight is not only understanding the risks a Company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. As a critical part of this risk management oversight role, our Board encourages full and open communication between management and the Board. Our Board regularly reviews material strategic, operational, financial, compensation and compliance risks with management. In addition our management team regularly reports to the full Board regarding their areas of responsibility and a component of these reports is risk within the area of responsibility and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Additional review or reporting on risk is conducted as needed or as requested by our Board.\n\nAttendance\n\nThere were 4 meetings, exclusive of action by unanimous written consent, of the Board held during fiscal year 2023. During such year, Mr. Yap, as the only incumbent director, attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board. The Company did not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in fiscal year 2023 and instead the Company’s directors were elected by written consent of the shareholders. We encourage our directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nThere were 2 meetings each, exclusive of action by unanimous written consent, of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Compensation Committee held during fiscal year 2023. The Company expects that each incumbent director will attend at least 75% of the meetings.\n\n**Board Diversity Matrix**\n\nThe following chart summarizes certain self-identified personal characteristics of our Directors, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(f).\n\n12  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nEach term used in the table has the meaning given to it in the rule and related instructions.\n\n**Board Diversity Matrix (As of September 4, 2024)**  \n---  \n**Board Size:**  \nTotal Number of Directors |  5  \n**Female** |  **Male** |  **Non-Binary** |  **Did Not**  \n**Disclose Gender**  \n**Gender:**  \nDirectors |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0  \n**Number of Directors who identify in Any of the Categories Below:**  \nAfrican American or Black |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nAlaskan Native or Native American |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nAsian (other than South Asian) |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0  \nSouth Asian |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nHispanic or Latinx |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nWhite |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0  \nLGBTQ+ |  0  \nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background |  0  \n  \n**Vote Required**\n\nDirectors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, with the five nominees obtaining the greatest number of affirmative votes being elected as Directors, even if less than a majority.

If the stockholders do not ratify this selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT. Even if the selection is ratified, our Audit Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that the change would be in our best interests.\n\nRepresentatives of JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT are expected to be present by video at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.\n\nAll audit, audit-related, tax and other services rendered by JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT have been and will be reviewed, pre-approved and performance monitored by the Audit Committee. Audit and permissible non-audit services may be pre-approved by the Audit Committee delegate represented by Mr. Anderson, its chair, or Mr. Klausner, an Audit Committee member, if Mr. Anderson is not available. Pre-approval decisions are reported by the chair/delegate to the Audit Committee promptly but not later than the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting.\n\nIn its review of JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT's services, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, the possible impact of the performance of such services on the independence of JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT. The Audit Committee has determined that the services performed by JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT for the year ended December 31, 2023, were compatible with maintaining the independence of JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT. Additional information concerning the Audit Committee and its activities can be found in the following sections of this Proxy Statement: \"Board Committees\" and \"Report of the Audit Committee.\"\n\nJP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT has audited our financial statements since 2020.\n\n**Fees for Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**\n\nThe following is a summary of the aggregate fees recorded by us on a generally accepted accounting principles basis for the audit and other services rendered by JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT, our independent registered public accounting firm, for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022.\n\n**(1) Audit Fees**\n\nThe aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for our audit of annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our quarterly reports or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years were:\n\n2023 | $ | 92,833  \n---|---|---  \n2022 | $ | 32,500  \n  \n**(2) Audit-Related Fees**\n\nThe aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for assurance and related services by the principal accountants that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported in the preceding paragraph:\n\n2023 | $ | 5,201  \n---|---|---  \n2022 | $ | 2,301  \n14  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**(3) Tax Fees**\n\nThe aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning were:\n\n2023 | $ | 14,763  \n---|---|---  \n2022 | $ | 11,441  \n  \n**(4) All Other Fees**\n\nThe aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for the products and services provided by the principal accountant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) were:\n\n2022 | $ | 4,508  \n---|---|---  \n2022 | $ | 3,000  \n  \n**Vote Required**\n\nRatification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast.

The Incentive Plan is designed to enable the flexibility to grant equity awards to our key management employees, directors and consultants and to ensure that we can continue to grant equity awards to eligible recipients at levels determined to be appropriate by the Board and/or the Compensation Committee. If the Incentive Plan is not approved by the Shareholders, the Incentive Plan will not be in effect.\n\n**Summary of the Provisions of the Incentive Plan**\n\nThe following summary briefly describes the material features of the Incentive Plan and is qualified, in its entirety, by the specific language of the Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.\n\n**_Shares Available_**\n\nOur Board has authorized, subject to stockholder approval, 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock for issuance under the Incentive Plan. In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, share combination, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-up, reorganization, rights offering, liquidation, or any similar change event of or by our company, appropriate adjustments will be made to the shares subject to the Incentive Plan and to any outstanding Awards. Shares available for Awards under the Incentive Plan may be either newly-issued shares or treasury shares.\n\nIn certain circumstances, shares subject to an outstanding Award may again become available for issuance pursuant to other Awards available under the Incentive Plan. For example, shares subject to forfeited, terminated, canceled or expired Awards will again become available for future grants under the Incentive Plan.\n\n**_Administration_**\n\nThe Incentive Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board. The Committee will consist of at least two members who are non-employee directors within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. With respect to the participation of individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Incentive Plan is administered in compliance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the provisions of the Incentive Plan, the Committee determines the persons to whom grants of options, including but not limited to Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”), shares of restricted stock and other stock-based awards are to be made, the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each grant and all other terms and conditions of the grant. If an option is granted, the Committee determines whether the option is an incentive stock option or a nonstatutory stock option, the option’s term, vesting and exercisability, the amount and type of consideration to be paid to our company upon the option’s exercise and the other terms and conditions of the grant. The terms and conditions of restricted stock and SAR Awards are also determined by the Committee. The Committee has the responsibility to interpret the Incentive Plan and to make determinations with respect to all Awards granted under the Incentive Plan. All determinations of the Committee are final and binding on all persons having an interest in the Incentive Plan or in any Award made under the Incentive Plan. The costs and expenses of administering the Incentive Plan are borne by the Company.\n\n16  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**_Eligibility_**\n\nEligible individuals include our and our subsidiaries’ employees (including our and our subsidiaries’ officers and directors who are also employees), independent directors, advisor or consultants whose efforts, in the judgment of the Committee, are deemed worthy of encouragement to promote our growth and success. Non-employee directors of our Board are also eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan. All eligible individuals may receive one or more Awards under the Plan, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Incentive Plan. There is no assurance that an otherwise eligible individual will be selected by the Committee to receive an Award under the Incentive Plan. Because future Awards under the Incentive Plan will be granted in the discretion of the Committee, the type, number, recipients and other terms of such Awards cannot be determined at this time.\n\n**_Stock Options and SARs_**\n\nUnder the Incentive Plan, the Committee is authorized to grant both stock options and SARs. Stock options may be either designated as non-qualified stock options or incentive stock options. Incentive stock options, which are intended to meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code such that a participant can receive potentially favorable tax treatment, may only be granted to employees. Therefore, any stock option granted to consultants and non-employee directors are non-qualified stock options. The tax treatment of incentive and non-qualified stock options is generally described later in this summary. SARs may be granted either alone or in tandem with stock options. A SAR entitles the participant to receive the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share on the exercise date over the strike price of the SAR. This amount is payable in cash, except that the Committee may provide in an Award agreement that benefits may be paid in shares of our common stock. In general, if a SAR is granted in tandem with an option, the exercise of the option will cancel the SAR, and the exercise of the SAR will cancel the option. Any shares that are canceled will be made available for future Awards. The Committee, in its sole discretion, determines the terms and conditions of each stock option and SAR granted under the Incentive Plan, including the grant date, option or strike price (which, in no event, will be less than the par value of a share), whether a SAR is paid in cash or shares, the term of each option or SAR, exercise conditions and restrictions, conditions of forfeitures, and any other terms, conditions and restrictions consistent with the terms of the Incentive Plan, all of which will be evidenced in an individual Award agreement between us and the participant.\n\nCertain limitations apply to incentive stock options and SARs granted in tandem with incentive stock options. The per share exercise price of an incentive stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of the option’s grant and the term of any such option shall expire not later than the tenth anniversary of the date of the option’s grant. In addition, the per share exercise price of any option granted to a person who, at the time of the grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant and such option shall expire not later than the fifth anniversary of the date of the option’s grant.\n\nOptions and SARs granted under the Incentive Plan become exercisable at such times as may be specified by the Committee. In general, options and SARs granted to participants become exercisable in three equal annual installments, subject to the optionee’s continued employment or service with us. However, the aggregate value (determined as of the grant date) of the shares subject to incentive stock options that may become exercisable by a participant in any year may not exceed $100,000. If a SAR is granted in tandem with an option, the SAR will become exercisable at the same time or times as the option becomes exercisable.\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the Award agreement, options shall expire after a term of five years. However, the maximum term of options and SARs granted under the Incentive Plan is ten years. If any participant terminates employment due to death or disability or retirement, the portion of his or her option or SAR Awards that were exercisable at the time of such termination may be exercised for one year from the date of termination. In the case of any other termination, the portion of his or her option or SAR Awards that were exercisable at the time of such termination may be exercised for three months from the date of termination. However, if the remainder of the option or SAR term is shorter than the applicable post-termination exercise period, the participant’s rights to exercise the option or SAR will expire at the end of the term. In addition, if a participant’s service terminates due to cause, all rights under an option or SAR will immediately expire, including rights to the exercisable portion of the option or SAR. Shares attributable to an option or SAR that expire without being exercised will be forfeited by the participant and will again be available for Award under the Incentive Plan.\n\nUnless limited by the Committee in an Award agreement, payment for shares purchased pursuant to an option exercise may be made (i) in cash, check or wire transfer, (ii) subject to the Committee’s approval, in shares already owned by the participant (including restricted shares held by the participant at least six months prior to the exercise of the option) valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise, or (iii) through broker-assisted cashless exercise procedures.\n\n17  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**_Restricted Stock_**\n\nUnder the Incentive Plan, the Committee is also authorized to make Awards of restricted stock. A restricted stock Award entitles the participant to all of the rights of a stockholder of our company, including the right to vote the shares and the right to receive any dividends. However, the Committee may require the payment of cash dividends to be deferred and if the Committee so determines, re-invested in additional shares of restricted stock. Before the end of a restricted period and/or lapse of other restrictions established by the Committee, shares received as restricted stock shall contain a legend restricting their transfer, and may be forfeited (i) in the event of termination of employment, (ii) if our company or the participant does not achieve specified performance goals after the grant date and before the participant’s termination of employment or (iii) upon the failure to achieve other conditions set forth in the Award agreement.\n\nAn Award of restricted stock will be evidenced by a written agreement between us and the participant. The Award agreement will specify the number of shares of our common stock subject to the Award, the nature and/or length of the restrictions, the conditions that will result in the automatic and complete forfeiture of the shares and the time and manner in which the restrictions will lapse, subject to the Award holder’s continued employment by us, and any other terms and conditions the Committee shall impose consistent with the provisions of the Incentive Plan. The Committee also determines the amount, if any, that the participant shall pay for the shares of restricted stock. However, the participant must be required to pay at least the par value for each share of restricted stock. Upon the lapse of the restrictions, any legends on the shares of our common stock subject to the Award will be re-issued to the participant without such legend.\n\nUnless the Committee determines otherwise in the Award or other agreement, if a participant terminates employment for any reason, all rights to restricted stock that are then forfeitable will be forfeited. Restricted stock that is forfeited by the participant will again be available for Award under the Incentive Plan.\n\n**_Other Stock-Based Awards_**\n\nUnder the Incentive Plane, the Committee is also authorized to grant other stock-based awards valued in whole or in part by reference to or otherwise based on stock (“Other Stock-Based Awards”), which include performance shares, convertible preferred stock (to the extent a series of preferred stock is authorized), convertible debentures, warrants, exchangeable securities and awards based of stock or options based on fair market value, book value, or performance by the Company or any subsidiary, affiliate or division. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted in tandem with other Awards under the Incentive Plan.\n\nOther Stock-Based Awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered prior to the date to which the stock is issued or, if later, the date on which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period lapses. The recipient of an Other Stock-Based Award, subject to the terms of the grant agreement, is entitled to interest or dividends with respect to the number of shares covered by their Other Stock-Based Award.\n\n**_Change in Control Provisions_**\n\nIn the event of a change in control of the Company, and except as otherwise set forth in the applicable grant agreement, all unvested portions of Awards shall vest immediately. Awards, whether or not then vested, shall be continued, assumed, or have new rights as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and restrictions to which any shares of Restricted Stock or any other Award granted prior to the change in control are subject shall not lapse. Awards shall, where appropriate at the Committee’s discretion, receive the same distribution of the Company’s common stock on such terms as determined by the Committee. Upon a change in control, the Committee may also provide for the purchase of any Awards for an amount of cash per share of common stock issuable under the Award equal to the excess of the highest price per share of the Company’s common stock paid in any transaction related to a change in control of the Company over the exercise price of such Award.\n\n18  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**_Fair Market Value_**\n\nUnder the Incentive Plan, fair market value means the fair market value of the shares based upon (i) the closing selling price of a share of our common stock as quoted on the principal national securities exchange on which the stock is traded, if the stock is then traded on a national securities exchange, or (ii) the closing bid price per share last quoted on that date by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the common stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange.\n\n**_Transferability Restrictions_**\n\nGenerally and unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, shares or rights subject to an Award cannot be assigned or transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and Awards may be exercised during the participant’s lifetime only by the participant or his or her guardian or legal representative. However, a participant may, if permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, transfer an Award, or any portion thereof, to one or more of the participant’s spouse, children or grandchildren, or may designate in writing a beneficiary to exercise an Award after his or her death.\n\n**_Clawback Policy_**\n\nAll awards granted under the Incentive Plan are subject to the terms of any Company potential forfeiture, incentive compensation recoupment, clawback, or similar actions. The Awards are also subject to policies established by the Company, such as anti-hedging or pledging policies. These policies and shall include, without limitation, (i) any Company policy established to comply with applicable laws (including, without limitation, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), and/or (ii) the rules and regulations of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the shares of Stock or other securities are listed or quoted, and these requirements shall be deemed incorporated by reference into all outstanding Award Agreements.\n\n**_Termination or Amendment of the Incentive Plan_**\n\nUnless sooner terminated, no Awards may be granted under the Incentive Plan after May 17, 2034. Our Board may amend or terminate the Incentive Plan at any time, but our Board may not, without stockholder approval, amend the Incentive Plan to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance of Awards. In addition, any amendment or modification of the Incentive Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval as required by any securities exchange on which our common stock is listed. No amendment or termination may deprive any participant of any rights under Awards previously made under the Incentive Plan.\n\n**_Summary of Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Incentive Plan_**\n\nThe following summary is intended only as a general guide as to the federal income tax consequences under current United States law with respect to participation in the Incentive Plan and does not attempt to describe all possible federal or other tax consequences of such participation. Furthermore, the tax consequences of awards made under the Incentive Plan are complex and subject to change, and a taxpayer’s particular situation may be such that some variation of the described rules is applicable.\n\n_Options and SARS._ There are three points in time when a participant and our company could potentially incur federal income tax consequences: date of grant, upon exercise and upon disposition. First, when an option or a SAR is granted to a participant, the participant does not recognize any income for federal income tax purposes on the date of grant. We similarly do not have any federal income tax consequences at the date of grant. Second, depending upon the type of option, the exercise of an option may or may not result in the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes. With respect to an incentive stock option, a participant will not recognize any ordinary income upon the option’s exercise (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply). However, a participant will generally recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option. In this case, the participant will recognize income equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of shares purchased pursuant to the option on the date of exercise. With respect to the exercise of a SAR, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the cash received (or, if applicable, value of the shares received).\n\n19  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nIncentive stock options are subject to certain holding requirements before a participant can dispose of the shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of the option and receive capital gains treatment on any income realized from the exercise of the option. Satisfaction of the holding periods determines the tax treatment of any income realized upon exercise. If a participant disposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option before the end of the applicable holding periods (called a “disqualifying disposition”), the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise of the incentive stock option minus the exercise price or (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares minus the exercise price. Any excess of the fair market value on the date of such disposition over the fair market value on the date of exercise must be recognized as capital gains by the participant. If a participant disposes of shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option after the applicable holding periods have expired, such disposition generally will result in long-term capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the sale price and the participant’s tax “basis” in such shares (generally, in such case, the tax “basis” is the exercise price).\n\nGenerally, we will be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant in connection with the exercise of options and SARs. However, we are generally not entitled to a tax deduction relating to amounts that represent capital gains to a participant. Accordingly, if the participant satisfies the requisite holding period with respect to an incentive stock option before disposition to receive the favorable tax treatment accorded incentive stock options, we will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to an incentive stock option. In the event the participant has a disqualifying disposition with respect to an incentive stock option, we will be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the amount that the participant recognized as ordinary income.\n\n_Restricted Stock Awards._ A participant will not be required to recognize any income for federal income tax purposes upon the grant of shares of restricted stock. With respect to Awards involving shares or other property, such as restricted stock Awards, that contain restrictions as to their transferability and are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares or other property received at the time the shares or other property become transferable or are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs first. We generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. A participant may elect to be taxed at the time he or she receives shares (e.g., restricted stock) or other property rather than upon the lapse of transferability restrictions or the substantial risk of forfeiture. However, if the participant subsequently forfeits such shares he or she would not be entitled to any tax deduction or, to recognize a loss, for the value of the shares or property on which he or she previously paid tax. Alternatively, if an Award that results in a transfer to the participant of cash, shares or other property does not contain any restrictions as to their transferability and is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or the fair market value of shares or other property actually received. We generally will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount.\n\n**Required Vote of Stockholders**\n\nThe approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal requires that a quorum exist and that the number of votes cast in favor of approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal exceeds the number of votes cast against approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal. Brokers are not permitted to vote shares held for a customer on “non-routine” matters (such as the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal) without specific instructions from the customer. Therefore, broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will also have no effect on the outcome of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal.\n\n**Interests of Directors and Executive Officers**\n\nOur directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this proposal except to the extent of their ownership of shares of our Common Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of our Board**\n\n**THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL 3 TO APPROVE OF THE 2024 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AND THE FORM, TERMS AND PROVISIONS.**\n\n20  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**PROPOSAL 4**\n\n**REVERSE STOCK SPLIT PROPOSAL:**\n\n**APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO**\n\n**THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT**\n\n**THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT**\n\n**Background**\n\nOn September 4, 2024, subject to stockholder approval, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an amendment (the “Charter Amendment”) to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our “Charter”) to, at the discretion of the Board, effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a ratio of 1:2 to 1:10 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), with the exact ratio within such range to be determined by the Board at its discretion. The primary goal of the Reverse Stock Split is to increase the per share market price of our Common Stock to meet the minimum per share bid price requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and to provide additional flexibility with respect to capital raising efforts and general corporate needs. We believe that a range of Reverse Stock Split ratios provides us with the most flexibility to achieve the desired results of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a “going private transaction” covered by Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Reverse Stock Split is not intended to modify the rights of existing stockholders in any material respect.\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Reverse Stock Split is effected, up to every 10 shares of our outstanding Common Stock would be combined and reclassified into one share of Common Stock. The actual timing for implementation of the Reverse Stock Split would be determined by the Board based upon its evaluation as to when such action would be most advantageous to the Company and our stockholders. Notwithstanding approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal by our stockholders, the Board will have the sole authority to elect whether or not and when to amend our Charter to effect the Reverse Stock Split. If the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by our stockholders, the Board will make a determination as to whether effecting the Reverse Stock Split is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders in light of, among other things, the Company’s ability to increase the trading price of our Common Stock to meet the minimum stock price standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) without effecting the Reverse Stock Split, the per share price of the Common Stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, the expected stability of the per share price of the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split and the need to increase flexibility with respect to potential capital raising efforts. If the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to effect the Reverse Stock Split, it will convene to determine the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split. For additional information concerning the factors the Board will consider in deciding whether to effect the Reverse Stock Split, see below under the headings “Determination of the Reverse Stock Split Ratio” and “Board Discretion to Effect the Reverse Stock Split.”\n\nThe text of the proposed Charter Amendment to effect the Reverse Stock Split is included as  _Annex B_ to this Proxy Statement. If the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by the Company’s stockholders, the Company will have the authority to file the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming, which will become effective upon its filing; provided, however, that the Charter Amendment is subject to revision to include such changes as may be required by the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming and as the Board deems necessary and advisable. The Board has determined that the Charter Amendment is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has submitted the Charter Amendment for consideration by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting.\n\n**Purpose and Effect of the Reverse Stock Split and Charter Amendment**\n\nWe are submitting this proposal to our stockholders for approval in order to increase the trading price of our Common Stock to meet the minimum per share bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and to give the Company additional flexibility with respect to capital raising efforts. We believe increasing the trading price of our Common Stock may assist in our capital-raising efforts by making our Common Stock more attractive to a broader range of investors. The Board also believes that some potential employees are less likely to work for the Company if we have a low stock price or are no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, irrespective of the size of our overall market capitalization. \n\n21  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nAdditionally, since we are not adjusting the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue, the Reserve Stock Split will have the benefit of increasing the number of shares of Common Stock the Company has the ability to issue. Currently, as of the Record Date, the Company has 300,000,000 authorized shares of Common Stock, of which 17,967,663 are currently issued and outstanding and 115,000of which are reserved for issuance under outstanding equity awards or convertible securities or otherwise reserved for issuance of Underwriter’s Warrants or under our equity incentive plan. Therefore, the Company currently has the ability to issue only 115,000additional shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date. Accordingly, we believe that the Reverse Stock Split is in our stockholders’ best interests.\n\n**_Nasdaq Requirement for Continued Listing_**. On the date of the mailing of this proxy statement, our Common Stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BGLC.” On November 6, 2023, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq stating that the Company did not satisfy the continued listing requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of common stock, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”), as the Company’s closing bid price was less than $1.00 per share for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Nasdaq letter. The Company was given a compliance period of 180 calendar days which was extended for an additional 180 days, or until November 4, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We believe that the Reverse Stock Split, if necessary, is currently our best option to meet the criteria to satisfy the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On September 4, 2024, the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $0.4326 per share. A decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from the Reverse Stock Split should, absent other factors, cause the per share market price of our Common Stock to trade above the required price. However, we cannot provide any assurance that (i) we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or other listing requirements, of the Nasdaq Capital Market or (ii) even if we do, that our minimum bid price would remain over the Minimum Bid Price Requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market following the Reverse Stock Split. We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\n**_Increased Credibility and Investor Interest_**. In addition, as noted above, we believe that the Reverse Stock Split and the resulting anticipated increase in the per share price of our Common Stock could encourage increased investor interest in our Common Stock and promote greater liquidity for our stockholders. The Board believes that continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market provides overall credibility to an investment in our stock, given the stringent listing and disclosure requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, we cannot provide assurance that our Common Stock would be listed on another national securities exchange, a national quotation service, the over-the-counter markets or the pink sheets. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even the issuance of a notice of potential delisting, could also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of our securities, decrease securities analysts’ coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence. \n\nA greater price per share of our Common Stock could allow a broader range of institutions to invest in our Common Stock (namely, funds that are prohibited or discouraged from buying stocks with a price below a certain threshold), potentially increasing marketability, trading volume and liquidity of our Common Stock. Many institutional investors view stocks trading at low prices as unduly speculative in nature and, as a result, avoid investing in such stocks. We believe that the Reverse Stock Split will provide flexibility to make our Common Stock a more attractive investment for these institutional investors, which we believe will enhance the liquidity for the holders of our Common Stock and may facilitate future sales of our Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split could also increase interest in our Common Stock for analysts and brokers who may otherwise have policies that discourage or prohibit them in following or recommending companies with low stock prices. Additionally, because brokers’ commissions on transactions in low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, the current average price per share of our Common Stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were substantially higher.\n\n22  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**_Ability to meet Present Capital Needs and Future Anticipated Growth._** As discussed below under the heading “Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on the Number of Shares of Common Stock Available for Future Issuance” the Reverse Stock Split will have the effect of increasing the number of shares of Common Stock that we have the ability to issue. The availability of additional shares of Common Stock may provide us with the flexibility to consider and respond to future business opportunities and needs as they arise, including public or private financings, subscription rights offerings, mergers, acquisitions, stock dividends, stock splits and the granting of equity incentive awards. The Reverse Stock Split may permit us to undertake certain of the foregoing actions without the delay and expense associated with holding a meeting of stockholders to obtain stockholder approval each time such an opportunity arises that would require the issuance of shares of Common Stock.\n\nThe Board believes it is important for the Company to maintain its flexibility in accessing the equity capital markets. As we have done in the past, we intend to raise capital through equity or debt financing to fund our current operations and support growth of our products. Such additional financing could take a variety of forms, including a private investment in our Common Stock or preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, an at-the-market offering of our Common Stock, rights offering or other public offering of equity or debt securities. The availability of additional equity or debt financing will depend on the continued execution of our business plan, our ability to demonstrate a path to long-term profitable growth, as well as market conditions. There can be no assurance that such equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. \n\nThe sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our stockholders, which could be significant. The incurrence of debt financing would result in additional debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for restrictive operating and financial covenants, security interests on our assets, and other terms that could be adverse to our current stockholders and other stakeholders. Failure to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our short and long-term liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.\n\nAs previously noted, we do not intend to use the Reverse Stock Split as a part of or a first step in a “going private” transaction within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act. There is no plan or contemplated plan by us to take ourselves private at the date of this Proxy Statement.\n\n**_Employee Retention._** The Board believes that the Company’s employees and directors who are compensated in the form of our equity-based securities may be less incentivized and invested in the Company if we are no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Accordingly, the Board believes that maintaining Nasdaq listing qualifications for our Common Stock, can help attract, retain, and motivate employees.\n\n**Risks Associated with the Reverse Stock Split**\n\n**_The Reverse Stock Split May Not Result in an Increased Price of our Common Stock over the Medium or Long-Term_**. As notedabove one principal purpose of the Reverse Stock Split is to increase the trading price of our Common Stock tomeet the minimum stock price standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split on the market price of our Common Stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and we cannot assure you that the Reverse Stock Split will accomplish this objective for any meaningful period of time, or at all. While we expect that the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock will proportionally increase the market price of our Common Stock, we cannot assure you that the Reverse Stock Split will increase the market price of our Common Stock by a multiple of the Reverse Stock Split ratio, or result in any permanent or sustained increase in the market price of our Common Stock. The market price of our Common Stock may be affected by other factors which may be unrelated to the number of shares outstanding, including the Company’s business and financial performance, general market conditions, and prospects for future success.\n\n**_The Reverse Stock Split May Decrease the Liquidity of our Common Stock_**. The Board believes that theReverse Stock Split may result in an increase in the market price of our Common Stock, which could lead toincreased interest in our Common Stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders. However,the Reverse Stock Split will also reduce the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, which maylead to reduced trading and a smaller number of market makers for our Common Stock, particularly if the priceper share of our Common Stock does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n**_The Reverse Stock Split May Result in Some Stockholders Owning “Odd Lots” That May Be More Difficult to Sell or Require Greater Transaction Costs per Share to Sell_**.If the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, itwill increase the number of stockholders who own “odd lots” of less than 100 shares of Common Stock. Apurchase or sale of less than 100 shares of Common Stock (an “odd lot” transaction) may result in incrementallyhigher trading costs through certain brokers, particularly “full service” brokers. Therefore, those stockholderswho own fewer than 100 shares of Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split may be required to payhigher transaction costs if they sell their Common Stock.\n\n23  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**_The Reverse Stock Split May Lead to a Decrease in our Overall Market Capitalization_**.The Reverse StockSplit may be viewed negatively by the market and, consequently, could lead to a decrease in our overall marketcapitalization. If the per share market price of our Common Stock does not increase in proportion to the ReverseStock Split ratio, or following such increase does not maintain or exceed such price, then the value of ourCompany, as measured by our market capitalization, will be reduced. Additionally, any reduction in our marketcapitalization may be magnified as a result of the smaller number of total shares of Common Stock outstandingfollowing the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n**Potential Consequences if the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, our Board will not have the authority to effect the Charter Amendment to, among other things, facilitate the continued listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market by increasing the per share trading price of our Common Stock to help ensure a share price high enough to satisfy the $1.00 per share Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Any inability of our Board to effect the Reverse Stock Split could expose us to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, if we need additional capital to fund operations and at such time do not have a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock to raise such additional capital, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If stockholder approval for the Reverse Stock Split is not obtained, the number of shares of Common Stock that are issued will not change and the anticipated benefits of the Reverse Stock Split described above will not be achieved.\n\n**Treatment of Fractional Shares in the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nThe Company will not issue fractional certificates for post-reverse stock split shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares will be entitled to rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number.\n\n**Determination of the Reverse Stock Split Ratio**\n\nThe Board believes that stockholder approval of a range of potential Reverse Stock Split ratios is in the best interests of our Company and stockholders because it is not possible to predict market conditions at the time the Reverse Stock Split would be implemented. We believe that a range of Reverse Stock Split ratios provides us with the most flexibility to achieve the desired results of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split ratio to be selected by our Board will not be more than 1-for-10.\n\nThe selection of the specific Reverse Stock Split ratio will be based on several factors, including, among other things:\n\n· |  our ability to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market;  \n---|---  \n· |  the per share price of our Common Stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split;  \n· |  the expected stability of the per share price of our Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split;  \n· |  the likelihood that the Reverse Stock Split will result in increased marketability and liquidity of our Common Stock;  \n· |  prevailing market conditions;  \n· |  general economic conditions in our industry; and  \n· |  our market capitalization before, and anticipated market capitalization after, the Reverse Stock Split.  \n  \nWe believe that granting our Board the authority to set the ratio for the Reverse Stock Split is essential because it allows us to take these factors into consideration and to react to changing market conditions. If the Board chooses to implement the Reverse Stock Split, the Company will make a public announcement regarding the determination of the Reverse Stock Split ratio.\n\n**Board Discretion to Effect the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved by our stockholders, the Board will have the discretion to implement the Reverse Stock Split or to not effect the Reverse Stock Split. The Board currently intends to effect the Reverse Stock Split. Even if the trading price of our Common Stock increases without effecting the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Split may not be necessary to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements, but the Board may elect to implement the Reverse Stock Split for the other reasons noted above. Following the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, there can be no assurance that the market price of our Common Stock will rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of outstanding shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split or that the market price of the post-split Common Stock can be maintained above $1.00. There also can be no assurance that our Common Stock will not be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market for other reasons.\n\n24  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \nIf our stockholders approve the Reverse Stock Split Proposal at the Annual Meeting, the Reverse Stock Split will be effected, if at all, only upon a determination by the Board that the Reverse Stock Split is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at that time. No further action on the part of the stockholders will be required to either effect or abandon the Reverse Stock Split. If our Board does not implement the Reverse Stock Split prior to December 31, 2024, the authority granted in this Reverse Stock Split Proposal to implement the Reverse Stock Split will terminate and the Charter Amendment will be abandoned.\n\nThe market price of our Common Stock is dependent upon our performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. If the Reverse Stock Split is effected and the market price of our Common Stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. Furthermore, the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split could significantly reduce the trading volume and otherwise adversely affect the liquidity of our Common Stock.\n\nWe have not proposed the Reverse Stock Split in response to any effort of which we are aware to accumulate our shares of Common Stock or obtain control of the Company, nor is it a plan by management to recommend a series of similar actions to our Board or our stockholders. Notwithstanding the decrease in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split, our Board does not intend for this transaction to be the first step in a “going private transaction” within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act.\n\n**Effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split, if approved by our stockholders, will become effective upon the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming of the Charter Amendment, the form of which is attached to this proxy statement as  _Annex B_. As discussed in more detail above, the exact timing of the filing of the Charter Amendment will be determined by the Board based upon its evaluation of when such action will be most advantageous to the Company and our stockholders. The Board reserves the right, notwithstanding stockholder approval and without further action by our stockholders, to elect not to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split if, at any time prior to filing such Charter Amendment, the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The Board currently intends to effect the Reverse Stock Split. If our Board does not implement the Reverse Stock Split prior to December 31, 2024, the authority granted in this Reverse Stock Split Proposal to implement the Reverse Stock Split will terminate and the Charter Amendment will be abandoned.\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Issued and Outstanding Common Stock**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is effected, it will reduce the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, including any shares held by the Company as treasury shares, by a Reverse Stock Split ratio of 1:4 to 1:10. Accordingly, each of our stockholders will own fewer shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. However, the Reverse Stock Split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split would result in an adjustment to a stockholder’s ownership of Common Stock due to the effect of rounding up fractional shares in the Reverse Stock Split, as described in more detail above. Therefore, voting rights and other rights and preferences of the holders of Common Stock will not be affected by the Reverse Stock Split (except for the effect of rounding up fractional shares). Common Stock issued pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split will remain fully paid and nonassessable, and the par value per share of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at no value. There will be no adjustment to the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue. The number of shares of authorized Common Stock will remain at 300,000,000 shares following the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n25  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Employee Plans, Outstanding Equity Awards and Warrants to Purchase Common Stock**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is effected, the terms of all outstanding warrants currently exercisable for shares of Common Stock, and all equity awards granted under the Incentive Plan, will be proportionally adjusted to maintain their economic value, subject to adjustments for any fractional shares as described herein. In addition, the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be the subject of future grants under the Incentive Plan, as well as any plan limits on the size of such grants will be adjusted and proportionately decreased as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. As of the Record Date, 115,000 shares of our Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under outstanding warrants.\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Voting Rights**\n\nProportionate voting rights and other rights of the holders of Common Stock would not be affected by the Reverse Stock Split (except for the effect of rounding up fractional shares). For example, a holder of 1% of the voting power of the outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split would continue to hold 1% of the voting power of the outstanding Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split (except for the effect of rounding up fractional shares).\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Regulatory Matters**\n\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect our obligation to publicly file financial and other information with the SEC.\n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on Authorized Share Capital**\n\nThe total number of shares of capital stock that we are authorized to issue will not be affected by the Reverse Stock Split and will remain at 330,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 30,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. \n\n**Effects of the Reverse Stock Split on the Number of Shares of Common Stock Available for Future Issuance**\n\nBy reducing the number of shares outstanding without reducing the number of shares of available but unissued Common Stock, the Reverse Stock Split will increase the number of authorized but unissued shares. Although the Reverse Stock Split would not have any dilutive effect on our stockholders, the Reverse Stock Split without a reduction in the number of shares authorized for issuance would reduce the proportion of shares owned by our stockholders relative to the number of shares authorized for issuance, giving the Board an effective increase in the authorized shares available for issuance, in its discretion. \n\nAs of the Record Date, approximately 17,967,663 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of our Preferred Stock were outstanding. An additional 115,000 shares of our Common Stock have been reserved for issuance as of the Record Date. For purposes of illustration, if the Reverse Stock Split is effected at a ratio of 1:10, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split would be approximately 1,796,767 shares and the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance after the Reverse Stock Split would be approximately 11,500 shares.\n\nThe Board believes the increase is appropriate for use to fund the future operations of the Company. The Company regularly considers its capital requirements and may conduct equity offerings in the future. The Board from time to time may deem it to be in the best interests of the Company to enter into transactions and other ventures that may include the issuance of shares of our Common Stock. If the Board authorizes the issuance of additional shares subsequent to the Reverse Stock Split, the dilution to the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be greater than would occur had the Reverse Stock Split not been effected. Because our stockholders have no preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any of our unissued shares of Common Stock, the future issuance of additional shares of Common Stock will reduce our current stockholders’ percentage ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of Common Stock. In the absence of a proportionate increase in our future earnings and book value, an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of Common Stock would dilute our projected future earnings per share, if any, and book value per share of all our outstanding shares of Common Stock. If these factors were reflected in the price per share of Common Stock, the potential realizable value of a stockholder’s investment could be adversely affected. An issuance of additional shares could therefore have an adverse effect on the potential realizable value of a stockholder’s investment.\n\n26  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**Mechanics of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is approved and effected, beginning on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, each certificate representing pre-split shares will, until surrendered and exchanged as described below, for all corporate purposes, be deemed to represent, respectively, only the number of post-split shares.\n\n**Exchange of Stock Certificates**\n\nShortly after the Reverse Stock Split becomes effective, stockholders will be notified and offered the opportunity at their own expense to surrender their current certificates to our stock transfer agent, Securities Transfer Corporation, in exchange for the issuance of new certificates reflecting the Reverse Stock Split in accordance with the procedures to be set forth in a letter of transmittal to be sent by our stock transfer agent. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the CUSIP number for the common stock will change from its current CUSIP number. This new CUSIP number will appear on any new stock certificates issued representing post-split shares. **STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT** **DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY STOCK** **CERTIFICATE(S) UNLESS AND UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO FOLLOWING THE** **ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.**\n\n**Effect on Registered “Book-Entry” Holders of Common Stock**\n\nHolders of Common Stock may hold some or all of their Common Stock electronically in book-entry form (“street name”) under the direct registration system for securities. These stockholders will not have stock certificates evidencing their ownership. They are, however, provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares of Common Stock registered in their accounts. If you hold registered Common Stock in book-entry form, you do not need to take any action to receive your post-split shares, if applicable.\n\n**Appraisal Rights**\n\nUnder the Wyoming Business Corporation Act, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal or dissenter’s rights with respect to the Reverse Stock Split, and we will not independently provide our stockholders with any such rights.\n\n**Regulatory Approvals**\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split will not be consummated, if at all, until after approval of our stockholders is obtained. We are not obligated to obtain any governmental approvals or comply with any state or federal regulations in order to effect the Reverse Stock Split other than the filing of the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming.\n\n**Accounting Treatment of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is effected, the par value per share of our Common Stock will remain unchanged at no value. Accordingly, on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, the stated capital on our consolidated balance sheets attributable to our Common Stock will be reduced in proportion to the size of the Reverse Stock Split ratio, and the additional paid-in-capital account will be increased by the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. Our stockholders’ equity, in the aggregate, will remain unchanged. Per share net income or loss will be increased because there will be fewer shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any Common Stock held in treasury will be reduced in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split ratio. The Company does not anticipate that any other accounting consequences, including changes to the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any period, will arise as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n27  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split**\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations of the Reverse Stock Split applicable to U.S. holders (as defined below). This discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. holder. The effects of U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a U.S. holder. We have not sought and do not intend to seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a position contrary to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\nThis discussion is limited to U.S. holders that hold Common Stock as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax, the rules related to “qualified small business stock” within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code or the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to U.S. holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:\n\n· |  U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;  \n---|---  \n· |  U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  \n· |  Persons holding Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;  \n· |  banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;  \n· |  real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;  \n· |  brokers, dealers or traders in securities;  \n· |  corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;  \n· |  S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);  \n· |  tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;  \n· |  persons deemed to sell Common Stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;  \n· |  persons who hold or received Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; and tax-qualified retirement plans.  \n  \nIf an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding Common Stock and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.\n\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split should constitute a “recapitalization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. holder of Common Stock generally should not recognize gain or loss upon the Reverse Stock Split. A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares of Common Stock received pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split should equal the aggregate tax basis of the shares of the Common Stock surrendered, and such U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares Common Stock received should include the holding period in the shares of Common Stock surrendered. Treasury Regulations provide detailed rules for allocating the tax basis and holding period of the shares of Common Stock surrendered to the shares of Common Stock received in a recapitalization pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split. U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock acquired on different dates and at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of the tax basis and holding period of such shares.\n\nAs noted above, we will not issue fractional shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares will be automatically entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of common stock to round up to the next whole post-split share. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of such a fractional share in a Reverse Stock Split is not clear. It is possible that the receipt of such an additional fraction of a share of common stock may be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend or as an amount received in exchange for common stock. We intend to treat the issuance of such an additional fraction of a share of common stock in the Reverse Stock Split as a non-recognition event, but there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court would not successfully assert otherwise.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval and Recommendation of the Board of Directors**\n\nApproval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal requires that a majority of the votes cast on the proposal vote for approval. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1, because they are not votes cast. Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this proposal.\n\n**THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE _FOR_ ****PROPOSAL 4 A****PPROVAL TO AMEND OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.**\n\n28  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**PROPOSAL 5:**\n\n**ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL:**\n\n**APPROVAL OF AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY,**\n\n**TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES IF THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT VOTES**\n\n**IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 4**\n\n**General**\n\nIf the Annual Meeting is convened and a quorum is present, but there are not sufficient votes to approve the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, our proxy holders may move to continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting at that time in order to enable our Board to solicit additional proxies.\n\nWe are asking our stockholders to approve a proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”) to adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Reverse Stock Split Proposal at the time of the Annual Meeting. If our stockholders approve this Adjournment Proposal, we can continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting and any adjourned session of the Annual Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against the Reverse Stock Split Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to defeat the Reverse Stock Split Proposal, we could continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting without a vote on such proposals and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of such proposals.\n\nIf it is necessary to continue, adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting, no notice of the continued, adjourned or postponed meeting is required to be given to our stockholders, other than an announcement at the Annual Meeting of the time and place to which the Annual Meeting is continued, adjourned or postponed, so long as the meeting is continued, adjourned or postponed for 30 days or less and no new record date is fixed for the continued, adjourned or postponed meeting. At the continued, adjourned or postponed meeting, we may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.\n\n**Required Vote**\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against Proposal 2 and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2. Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this proposal.\n\n**THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE _FOR_ PROPOSAL 5 APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.**\n\n29  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information known to us as of September 3, 2024 except where another date is noted below), with respect to beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by (i) each person (or group of affiliated persons) who is known by us to own beneficially more than five percent (5%) of our outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each director, (iii) each of our named executive officers (NEOs), and (iv) all current directors, executive officers and named executive officers as a group, together with the approximate percentages of outstanding Common Stock owned by each of them. The following table is based upon information supplied by directors, executive officers, other key executives identified as NEOs and principal stockholders. Beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. A person has beneficial ownership of shares if the person has the power to vote or dispose of such shares. This power can be exclusive or shared, direct or indirect. In addition, a person is considered by SEC rules to beneficially own shares underlying options and convertible securities that are presently exercisable or convertible or will become exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the date that beneficial ownership is calculated. Unless otherwise indicated the address of each beneficial owner is c/o BioNexus Gene Lab Corp., Unit A-28-7, Tower A, Menara UOA Bangsar, No.5 Jln Bangsar Utama 1, 59000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 17,967,663 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of September 3, 2024. \n\n**Name of beneficial owners** |  **Amount and** **nature of** **beneficial** **ownership of** **Common Stock** |  **Approximate** **percentage of** **outstanding** **Common Stock (1)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Removed Directors and Named Executive Officers:**  \nYeat Min Fong  | 25,000 | 0.14 | %  \nYee Meng Wong  | 25,000 | 0.14 | %  \nChi Yuen Leong  | - |  - |  %  \nTeng Fook Fong  | - | -  \nChee Keong Yap  | - | -  \nDr. Chak Hua Yew  | - | -  \nBoon Teong Teoh  | - | -  \nChai Ping Lin  | - | -  \nAll removed directors and executive officers as a group (8 persons) | 50,000 | 0.28 | %  \n**New Directors and Named Executive Officers:**  \nSu-Leng Tan Lee  | - | -  \nKoon Wai Wong  | 84 | 0.00 | %  \nMuhammad Azrul bin Abdul Hamid  | - | -  \nChee Keong Yap  | - | -  \nWei Foong Lim  | 362,936 | 2.02 | %  \nAll new directors and executive officers as a group (5 persons) | 363,020 | 2.02 | %  \n**5% or Greater Stockholders**  \nChoong-Chin Liew  | 1,666,667 | 9.28 | %  \nSoo Kow Lai | 1,250,001 | 6.95 |  %  \nChan Chong Wong  | 1,031,427 | 5.74 | %  \nKim Hai Wong  | 900,872 | 5.01 | %  \n(1)  |  Beneficial Ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.

This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” is intended to provide extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.\n\nFor the Annual Meeting, a number of brokers with account holders who are Company stockholders will be “householding” our proxy materials. This means a single copy of the proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, you may (1) if you are not a stockholder of record, notify your broker, or (2) if you are a stockholder of record, direct your written request to Investor Relations, BioNexus Gene Lab Corp., Unit A-28-7, Tower A, Menara UOA Bangsar, No.5 Jln Bangsar Utama 1, 59000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia or your oral request to the Company at +60 3 86796680. If you currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at your address and would like to request “householding” of these communications, please contact your broker if you are not a stockholder of record; or contact our Investor Relations department if you are a stockholder of record, using the contact information provided above.\n\n**OTHER MATTERS**\n\nWe know of no other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the proxies will be voted by the persons named therein in accordance with their judgment on such matters. Discretionary authority with respect to such other matters is granted by a stockholder’s submission of their proxy.\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\nWe file annual and quarterly reports and other reports and information with the SEC. Stockholders may obtain a copy of these reports, including the financial statements and financial statement schedules, without charge, by writing to Investor Relations at our principal executive offices located at Unit A-28-7, Tower A, Menara UOA Bangsar, No.5 Jln Bangsar Utama 1, 59000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We will furnish upon request any exhibits to the Form 10-K upon the payment by the requesting stockholder of our reasonable expenses in furnishing such exhibits.

The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Awards to any Eligible Individual, whether or not he or she has previously received an Award. Participation in the Plan shall be limited to those Key Employees, independent directors, consultants and advisors who have received written notification from the Committee, or from a person designated by the Committee, that they have been selected to participate in the Plan.

No Participant, having been granted an Award, shall have the right to an additional Award in the future unless such Award is granted by the Committee.\n\n**1.5 Maximum number of Shares Available for Awards**.

In order to assure the viability of Awards granted to Participants employed in various jurisdictions, the Committee may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom applicable in the jurisdiction in which the Participant resides or is employed. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of, the Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose; provided, however, that no such supplements, amendments, restatements or alternative versions shall increase the Share limitations contained in Section 1.5 of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate any Applicable Laws.\n\n**1.7 General Conditions to Grants**. The Grant Date of an Award shall be the date on which the Committee grants the Award or such later date as specified in advance by the Committee. All Awards shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement and any terms and conditions of an Award not set forth in the Plan shall be set forth in the Award Agreement related to that Award or in the Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary.\n\n**SECTION 2. Options**\n\n**2.1 Awards of Options**. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate from time to time those Eligible Individuals to whom Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options, or both, shall be granted and the number of Shares to be granted to each such Eligible Individual; provided, however, that only Key Employees may receive Incentive Stock Options and the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the shares with respect to which any incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by any Key Employee during any calendar year under all incentive stock option plans of the Corporation and any Subsidiary shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or such other limit set forth in Section 422 of the Code (the “Limitations of the Code”). If the aggregate fair market value of such shares exceeds the Limitations of the Code, the excess Shares will be treated as Non-qualified Options under this Plan. In reducing the number of Incentive Stock Options to meet the Limitations of the Code, the most recently granted Incentive Stock Options shall be reduced first. If a reduction of simultaneously granted Options is necessary to meet the Limitations of the Code, the Committee may designate which Shares are to be treated as Shares acquired pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option. In the event that any Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan fail to meet the requirements for Incentive Stock Options as set forth in the Code, such Incentive Stock Options will be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options under the Plan. In determining the Eligible Individuals who will be granted Options under the Plan, the Committee may consider such individuals’ responsibilities, service, present and future value to the Corporation or any Subsidiary and other factors it considers relevant.\n\n**2.2 Terms and Conditions of Options**. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary or in an Award Agreement, each Option shall be subject to the following express terms and conditions and to such other terms and conditions as the Committee may deem appropriate as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary:\n\n(a) Option Term. Each Option shall expire on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Grant Date or on such earlier date as may be specified in the Participant’s Award Agreement or employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary. The Committee may extend such Option Term; provided, however, that (i) such extension shall not in any way disqualify the Option as an Incentive Stock Option and (ii) the Option Term, including any such extensions, shall not exceed ten (10) years. The Option Term of Incentive Stock Options granted to 10% Owners shall not exceed five (5) years.\n\n37  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n(b) Option Price. The Option Price per Share shall be determined by the Committee no later than the Grant Date of any Option; provided, however, (i) the Option Price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, and (ii) in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a 10% Owner, the Option Price shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date (but in no event less than the par value of a Share). The Option Price may be denominated in U.S. Dollars, Chinese Renminbi or other local currency as determined by the Committee.\n\n(c) Exercise of Option. The exercisability of an Option shall be determined by the Committee. Subject to acceleration or early expiration as provided elsewhere in the Plan or in a Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the vesting of any Option granted under the Plan shall be subject to the Participant remaining in the employ of or maintaining a consultancy with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and shall vest (i) in five (5) equal installments of twenty percent (20%) of the amount granted, with the first installment vesting on the March 31 next following the Grant Date and each other installment vesting on each of the next four March 31 dates thereafter or (ii) in such other amounts over such period of time after the Grant Date as the Committee may designate.\n\n(d) Disqualifying Disposition. The Award Agreement shall require any Participant who is granted an Incentive Stock Option to notify the Corporation of any disposition of such Shares issued upon the exercise of such Incentive Stock Option under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions) (a “Disqualifying Disposition”) within ten (10) business days after such Disqualifying Disposition.\n\n(e) Payment of Purchase Price upon Exercise. The purchase price as to which an Option shall be exercised shall be paid to the Corporation at the time of exercise either (i) in cash, certified check or wire transfer denominated in U.S. Dollars, Chinese Renminbi or other local currency, (ii) in such other consideration as the Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, loans from the Corporation or a third party and cashless exercise, (iii) subject to the approval of the Committee, in Mature Shares already owned by the Participant having a total fair market value, as determined by the Committee, equal to the purchase price, or a combination of cash (denominated in U.S. Dollars, Chinese Renminbi or other local currency) and Mature Shares having a total fair market value, as so determined, equal to the purchase price, (iv) subject to the approval of the Committee, in its sole discretion, by delivering a properly executed exercise notice in a form approved by the Committee, together with an irrevocable notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Corporation the amount of applicable sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay the purchase price for such Shares, together with the amount of federal, state and local withholding taxes payable by Participant by reason of such exercise, (v) or (v) a combination of the foregoing.\n\n(f) Exercise in the Event of Termination.

If a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or any Subsidiary shall terminate for any reason other than by reason of his or her death, such Participant may exercise his or her Options, to the extent that such Participant shall have been entitled to do so on the date of such termination, at any time, or from time to time, but not later than (x) the expiration date specified in Subsection 2.2(a) hereof or (y) three (3) months after the date of such termination, whichever date is earlier and any portion of any Option granted hereunder that is not vested and exercisable as of the date of the Participant’s termination of employment shall automatically expire and be forfeited as of such date of termination.\n\n38  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n(ii) Upon Termination Due to Death. In the event a Participant’s employment or consultancy shall terminate by reason of his or her death, such Participant’s Beneficiary, heirs or estate may exercise his or her Options, to the extent that such Participant, if such Participant had not died, would have been entitled to do so within the calendar year following such Participant’s death, at any time, or from time to time, but not later than (x) the expiration date specified in Subsection 2.2(a) hereof or (y) one year after the date of death, whichever is earlier and any portion of any Option granted hereunder that would not have vested and been exercisable within the calendar year following such Participant’s death if such Participant had not died shall automatically expire and be forfeited as of the date of such Participant’s death.\n\n(g) Transferability of Stock Options. No Option granted under the Plan shall be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the jurisdiction wherein the Participant is domiciled at the time of his or her death, and during the lifetime of the Participant, shall be exercisable only by the Participant or his or her guardian or legal representative.\n\n(h) Investment Representation. Each Award Agreement for an Option shall provide (or be deemed to provide) that, upon demand by the Committee for such a representation, the Participant (or any person acting under Subsection 2.2(e) hereof) shall deliver to the Committee, at the time of any exercise of an Option or portion thereof, a written representation that the Shares to be acquired upon such exercise are to be acquired for investment and not for resale or with a view to the distribution thereof. Upon such demand, delivery of such representation prior to the delivery of any Common Stock issued upon exercise of an Option and prior to the expiration of the Option Term shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Participant or such other person to purchase any Common Stock. In the event certificates for Common Stock are delivered under the Plan with respect to which such an investment representation has been obtained, the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on such certificates to make appropriate reference to such representations and to restrict transfer in the absence of compliance with applicable federal, state or other governmental securities laws.\n\n(i) Participants to Have No Rights as Shareholders. No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Common Stock subject to his or her Option prior to the date of issuance to him or her of such Common Stock.\n\n(j) Other Option Provisions. The Committee may require a Participant to agree, as a condition to receiving an Option under the Plan, that part or all of any Options previously granted to such Participant under the Plan or any prior plan of the Corporation be terminated.\n\n2.3 **Exercise of Options**. An Option shall be exercised by the delivery to the Corporation during the Option Term of (x) written notice of intent to purchase a specific number of Shares subject to the Option and (y) payment in full of the Option Price of such specific number of Shares, pursuant to subsection 2.3(e).\n\n**SECTION 3. Stock Appreciation Rights**\n\n**3.1 Award of Stock Appreciation Rights**. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate from time to time those Eligible Individuals to whom SARs shall be granted and the number of Shares to be granted to each such Eligible Individual. When granted, SARS may, but need not, be identified with a specific Option (including any Option granted on or before the Grant Date of the SARs) in a number equal to or different from the number of SARs so granted. If SARs are identified with Shares subject to an Option, then, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, the Participant’s associated SARs shall terminate upon (x) the expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of such Option, or (y) the exercise of such Option.\n\n**3.2 Strike Price**. The strike price (“Strike Price”) of any SAR shall equal, for any SAR that is identified with an Option, the Option Price of such Option, or for any other SAR, 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date of such SAR; except that the Committee may (x) specify a higher Strike Price in the Award Agreement or (y) provide that the benefit payable upon exercise of any SAR shall not exceed a percentage of Fair Market Value of a Share on such Grant Date as the Committee shall specify.\n\n39  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**3.3 Vesting of SARs**. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Award Agreement or in the Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (x) each SAR not identified with any other Award shall become exercisable with respect to 20% of the Shares subject thereto on each of the first five March 31 dates following the Grant Date of such SAR or in such other amounts and over such other time period as may be determined by the Committee and (y) each SAR which is identified with any other Award shall become exercisable as and to the extent that the Option with which such SAR is identified may be exercised.\n\n**3.4 Exercise of SARs**. SARs shall be exercised by delivery to the Corporation of written notice of intent to exercise a specific number of SARs. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or a Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the exercise of SARs that are identified with Shares subject to an Option shall result in the cancellation or forfeiture of such Option, to the extent of such exercise and any such Shares so canceled or forfeited shall not thereafter again become available for grant under the Plan. The benefit for each SAR shall be equal to (x) the Fair Market Value of the Share on the date of such exercise, minus (y) the Strike Price of such SAR. Such benefit shall be payable in cash (subject to applicable withholding), except that the Committee may provide in the applicable Award Agreement that benefits may be paid wholly or partly in Shares.\n\n**3.5 No Rights as Shareholders**. No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Common Stock subject to his or her SAR.\n\n**3.6 Exercise in the Event of Termination**. Unless otherwise provided in a Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary or Award Agreement, the following provisions shall apply upon termination of a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or any Subsidiary:\n\n(i) Upon Termination For Any Reason Other Than Due to Death. If a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or any Subsidiary shall terminate for any reason other than by reason of his or her death, such Participant may exercise his or her SARs, to the extent that such Participant shall have been entitled to do so on the date of such termination, at any time, or from time to time, but not later than (x) the expiration date specified in Subsection 2.2(a) hereof or (y) three (3) months after the date of such termination, whichever date is earlier, and any SARs granted hereunder that are not vested and exercisable as of the date of the Participant’s termination of employment shall automatically expire and be forfeited as of such date of termination.\n\n(ii) Upon Termination Due to Death. In the event a Participant’s employment or consultancy shall terminate by reason of his or her death, such Participant’s Beneficiary, heirs or estate may exercise his or her SARs, to the extent that such Participant, if such Participant had not died, would have been entitled to do so within the calendar year following such Participant’s death, at any time, or from time to time, but not later than (x) the expiration date specified in Subsection 2.2(a) hereof or (y) one year after the date of death, whichever is earlier and any SARs granted hereunder that would not have vested and been exercisable within the calendar year following such Participant’s death if such Participant had not died shall automatically expire and be forfeited as of the date of such Participant’s death.\n\n**SECTION 4. Restricted Stock**\n\n**4.1 Awards of Restricted Stock**. Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan shall be subject to certain Restrictions as provided below. All Restrictions imposed on any such Award of Restricted Stock shall be made by and at the discretion of the Committee, subject to the provisions of the Plan, and are binding on the Corporation and the Participants, their Beneficiaries and legal representatives.\n\n**4.2 Restricted Period/Restrictions**.

The certificates for any Restricted Stock awarded to an Eligible Individual under the Plan shall be held (together with a stock power executed in blank by the Eligible Individual) in escrow by the Secretary of the Corporation under the Participant’s name in an account maintained by the Corporation until such Shares of Restricted Stock become nonforfeitable or are forfeited. At the conclusion of the Restricted Period or the expiration or attainment of such other Restrictions imposed on any Restricted Stock granted to a Participant, or upon the prior approval of the Committee as described in Section 4.5 hereof, and subject to the satisfaction of the Corporation’s withholding obligations described in Section 5.7 hereof, certificates representing such Shares of Restricted Stock shall be delivered to the Participant, or the Beneficiary or legal representative of the Participant, free of the Restrictions set forth in the Award Agreement pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof.\n\n**4.5 Termination of a Participant’s Employment or Consultancy**. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or in the Participant’s employment or other agreement with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the following provisions shall apply upon termination of a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or any Subsidiary:\n\n(i) Upon Termination for any Reason other than Due to Death. If a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or any Subsidiary is terminated, except termination due to death, all Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan which are then subject to a Restricted Period or other Restrictions will be forfeited and become the property of the Corporation on the date of such termination. However, the Committee may, if it, in its sole discretion, determines that the circumstances warrant such action, approve the release of all or any part of the Restricted Stock that would otherwise be forfeited pursuant to this Section, upon such conditions as it shall determine.\n\n(ii) Upon Termination Due to Death. If a Participant’s employment or consultancy with the Corporation or a Subsidiary is terminated due to death, all Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan which are then subject to a Restricted Period or other Restrictions and which would have been released, if the Participant had not died, within the calendar year following the Participant’s death shall be released on the date of such termination as if with respect to such Shares the Restricted Period had ended and the other Restrictions had lapsed and certificates representing such Shares of Restricted Stock shall be delivered to the Participant’s Beneficiary or legal representative free from such Restrictions as soon as practicable following such termination and all other Shares of Restricted Stock that would not have been released, if the Participant had not died, within the calendar year following the Participant’s death will be forfeited and become the property of the Corporation on the date of such termination.\n\n**4.6 Section 83(b) Elections**. A Participant who files an election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service to include the Fair Market Value of any Restricted Stock in gross income while they are still subject to a Restricted Period or other Restrictions shall notify the Corporation of such election within ten (10) days of making such election and promptly furnish the Corporation with a copy of such election, together with the amount of any federal, state, local or other taxes required to be withheld to enable the Corporation to claim an income tax deduction with respect to such election.\n\n41  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**SECTION 5.

General Provisions**\n\n**7.1 General Creditor Status**. Participants shall have no right, title or interest whatsoever in or to any investments which the Corporation may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation and any Participant, Beneficiary, legal representative or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Corporation under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Corporation. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Corporation and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan; provided, however , that in its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or pay cash; provided, further, however, that, unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of the affected Participant, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the “unfunded” status of the Plan.\n\n**7.2 Certain Adjustments to Shares**. In the event of any change in the Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, spin-off, split-off, merger, consolidation, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any rights offering to purchase Common Stock at a price substantially below fair market value, or of any similar change affecting the Common Stock of or by the Corporation, the number and kind of Shares available for Awards under the Plan and the number and kind of Shares subject to a Restricted Period or other Restrictions or subject to Options in outstanding Awards and the Option Price or purchase price per Share thereof shall be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, the Participants hereunder. Any adjustment of an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to this Section shall be made only to the extent not constituting a “modification” within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code, unless the holder of such Option shall agree otherwise. The Committee shall give notice to each Participant of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section and, upon notice, such adjustment shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.\n\n43  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**7.3 Successor Corporation**.

The Corporation agrees that it will make appropriate provision for the preservation of Participants’ rights under the Plan in any agreement or plan which it may enter into or adopt to effect any such merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of assets.\n\n**7.4 No Claim or Right Under the Plan**. Neither the Plan nor any action taken thereunder shall be construed as giving any employee, independent directors, consultant or advisor any right to be retained in the employ of or by the Corporation.\n\n**7.5 Awards Not Treated as Compensation Under Benefit Plans**. No Award shall be considered as compensation under any employee benefit plan of the Corporation, except as specifically provided in any such plan or as otherwise determined by the Board.\n\n**7.6 Listing and Qualification of Common Stock**. The Corporation, in its discretion, may postpone the issuance or delivery of Common Stock upon any exercise of an Option or pursuant to an Award of Restricted Stock until completion of such stock exchange listing or other qualification of such shares under any state, federal or other governmental law, rule or regulation as the Corporation may consider appropriate, and may require any Participant, Beneficiary or legal representative to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of the shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\n**7.7 Withholding Taxes**. The Corporation may make such provisions and take such steps as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the withholding of all federal, state and local taxes required by law to be withheld, including, without limitation, taxes required to be withheld under the tax laws, rules and regulations and governmental orders of Malaysia, with respect to Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, including, but not limited to, (i) accepting a remittance from the Participant in cash, or in the Committee’s discretion in Mature Shares (ii) deducting the amount required to be withheld from any other amount then or thereafter payable by the Corporation or Subsidiary to a Participant, Beneficiary or legal representative or from any Shares due to the Participant under the Plan, (iii) requiring a Participant, Beneficiary or legal representative to pay to the Corporation the amount required to be withheld as a condition of releasing Common Stock or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. In addition, subject to such rules and regulations as the Committee shall from time to time establish, Participants shall be permitted to satisfy federal, state and local taxes, if any, imposed upon the payment of Awards in Common Stock at a rate up to such Participant’s maximum marginal tax rate with respect to each such tax by (i) irrevocably electing to have the Corporation deduct from the number of Shares otherwise deliverable in payment of an Award such number of Shares as shall have a value equal to the amount of tax to be withheld, (ii) delivering to the Corporation such portion of the Common Stock delivered in payment of the Award as shall have a value equal to the amount of tax to be withheld, or (iii) delivering to the Corporation such number of Mature Shares or combination of Mature Shares and cash as shall have a value equal to the amount of tax to be withheld.\n\n44  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**7.8 Non-transferability/Designation and Change of Beneficiary**.\n\n(a) An Award granted hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the jurisdiction wherein the Participant is domiciled at the time of his or her death and may be exercised during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant or his or her guardian or legal representative.\n\n(b) Each Participant shall file with the Committee a written designation of one or more persons as the Beneficiary who shall be entitled to receive the amount, if any, payable under the Plan upon his or her death. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his or her Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior Beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Committee. The last such designation received by the Committee shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participant’s death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt.\n\n**7.9 Payments to Persons Other Than A Participant**. If the Committee shall find that any person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any payment due to such person or his or her estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may, if the Committee so directs the Corporation, be paid to his or her spouse, a child, a relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of such person, or any other person deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Committee and the Corporation therefor. \n\n**7.10 Designated Participants**.\n\n(a) If the Committee determines in its sole discretion that an appointment is necessary or desirable to comply with the regulatory requirements in Malaysia, it may appoint the Corporation, a Subsidiary or any other institution or organization registered outside of Malaysia (a “Trustee”) to hold the interest and exercise the rights granted under the Plan of any Participant (a “Designated Participant”) who either is a national of and ordinary resident in Malaysia or is otherwise designated by the Committee as a Designated Participant. In relation to any such appointment, the Trustee will undertake to do the following for and on behalf of the Designated Participant, subject at all times to the Committee’s supervision:\n\n(i) execute the relevant Award Agreement with the Corporation;\n\n(ii) hold the Award (a “Designated Award”) for the benefit of the Designated Participant;\n\n(iii) take such actions as the Designated Participant may instruct from time to time in connection with the Designated Award or otherwise in relation to the Designated Participant’s beneficial interest under the Plan or under the Award Agreement, including taking such actions as may be necessary to exercise the Designated Award under the terms of Section 2.2(c) of the Plan and making payment under the terms of Section 2.2(e) of the Plan; and\n\n(iv) after deducting its costs, fees and expenses as contemplated under subsection 5.10(d), hold, or at the Designated Participant’s direction remit to the Designated Participant, the net proceeds of sales or other transactions involving the Designated Award or, as applicable, shares of Common Stock underlying such Award.\n\n(b) Without limiting the scope of its authorities under Section 2.1 or any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may at any time impose restrictions on the method of exercise of a Designated Award, such that upon exercise of the Designated Award, the Designated Participant (or the Trustee acting on the Designated Participant’s behalf) does not receive Shares and receives solely cash, in the amount and denomination determined under Section 2.2(e).\n\n(c) An appointment of a Trustee pursuant to the terms of this Section to hold the interest and exercise the rights for the benefit of the Designated Participant shall terminate at such time as the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such appointment is no longer necessary or desirable in order to comply with regulatory requirements in Malaysia.\n\n45  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n(d) The Trustee may deduct from the proceeds of sales or other transactions involving the Designated Award or, as applicable, Shares underlying such Award, any costs, fees and expenses of the Trustee in relation to its appointment under this Section. The Trustee will, under no circumstances, otherwise require the Designated Participant to compensate it for any of its costs, fees, expenses or losses.\n\n**7.11 No Liability of Committee Members**. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable by reason of any contract or other instrument executed by such member or on his or her behalf in his or her capacity as a member of the Committee nor for any mistake of judgment made in good faith, and the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each employee, officer or director of the Corporation to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan may be allocated or delegated, against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Board) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person’s own fraud or bad faith. The indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 shall be in addition to any rights of indemnification such Committee member has as a director or officer pursuant to law, under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Corporation.\n\n**7.12 Amendment or Termination**. Except as to matters that in the opinion of the Corporation’s legal counsel require stockholder approval, any provision of the Plan may be modified as to a Participant by an individual agreement approved by the Committee. The Board may, with prospective or retroactive effect, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided, however, that (i) no amendment that would materially increase the cost of the Plan to the Corporation may be made by the Board without the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation and (ii) no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall deprive any Participant of any rights to Awards previously made under the Plan without his or her written consent. Subject to earlier termination pursuant to the provisions of this Section, and unless the stockholders of the Corporation shall have approved an extension of the Plan beyond such date, the Plan shall terminate and no further Awards shall be made under the Plan after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date of the Plan.\n\n**7.13 Governing Law**. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.\n\n**7.14 Non-uniform Determinations**. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by the Committee selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards whether or not such persons are similarly situated. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall be entitled, to enter into non-uniform and selective Award Agreements as to (a) the identity of the Participant, (b) the terms and provisions of Awards, and (c) the treatment of termination of employment or consultancies.\n\n**7.15 Clawback Policy**. All Awards (including on a retroactive basis) granted under the Plan are subject to the terms of any Corporation forfeiture, incentive compensation recoupment, clawback or similar policy as it may be in effect from time to time, as well as any similar provisions of applicable laws, as well as any other policy of the Corporation that may apply to the Awards, such as anti-hedging or pledging policies, as they may be in effect from time to time. In particular, these policies and/or provisions shall include, without limitation, (i) any Corporation policy established to comply with applicable laws (including, without limitation, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), and/or (ii) the rules and regulations of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the shares of Stock or other securities are listed or quoted, and these requirements shall be deemed incorporated by reference into all outstanding Award Agreements.\n\n**7.16 Section 409A of the Code.**\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, all Awards made under this Plan are intended to be exempt from or, in the alternative, comply with Section 409A of the Code and the authoritative guidance thereunder, including the exceptions for stock rights and short-term deferrals. The Plan shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Each payment under an Award shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.\n\n46  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n(b) If a Participant is a “specified employee” (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code) at the time of his termination of service, no amount that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that becomes payable by reason of such termination of service shall be paid to the Participant (or in the event of the Participant’s death, the Participant’s representative or estate) before the earlier of (x) the first business day after the date that is six months following the date of the Participant’s termination of service, and (y) within 30 days following the date of the Participant’s death. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, a termination of service shall be deemed to occur only if it is a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and references in the Plan and any Award Agreement to “termination of service” or similar terms shall mean a “separation from service.” If any Award is or becomes subject to Section 409A of the Code, unless the applicable Award Agreement provides otherwise, such Award shall be payable upon the Participant’s “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. If any Award is or becomes subject to Section 409A of the Code and if payment of such Award would be accelerated or otherwise triggered under a Change of Control, then the definition of Change of Control shall be deemed modified, only to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, to mean a “change in control event” as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.\n\n(c) Any adjustments made pursuant to Article XV to Awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and any adjustments made pursuant to Article XV to Awards that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either (x) continue not to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or (y) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.\n\n**7.17 No Illegal Transactions.** The Plan and all Awards granted pursuant to it are subject to all applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award, Participants shall not be entitled to exercise or receive benefits under, any Award, and the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares or deliver any benefits to a Participant, if such exercise or delivery would constitute a violation by the Participant or the Corporation of any applicable law or regulation.\n\n**7.18 Severability**. If any part of the Plan is declared by any court of governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any other part of the Plan. Any Section or part of a Section so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.\n\n**7.19 No Funding.** The Plan shall be unfunded. The Corporation shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of funds or assets to ensure the payment of any Award. Prior to receipt of Shares or a cash distribution pursuant to the terms of an Award, such Award shall represent an unfunded unsecured contractual obligation of the Corporation and the Participant shall have no greater claim to the Shares underlying such Award or any other assets of the Corporation or Affiliate than any other unsecured general creditor.\n\n47  \n---  \n_[Table of Contents](#BGLC_PRE14A_HTM_TOC)_  \n  \n**ANNEX B**\n\n**Form of Charter Amendment**\n\n**CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT**\n\n**TO THE**\n\n**AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION**\n\n**OF**\n\n**BIONEXUS GENE LAB CORP**\n\nBioNexus Gene Lab Corp.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, no fractional shares will be issued in connection with the combination effected by the preceding sentence. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall make provision for the issuance of that number of fractions of shares of Common Stock such that any fractional share of a holder otherwise resulting from the 2024 Reverse Split shall be rounded up to the next whole number of shares of Common Stock. As of the 2024 Split Effective Time and thereafter, a certificate(s) representing shares of Common Stock prior to the 2024 Reverse Split is deemed to represent the number of post-2024 Reverse Split shares into which the pre-2024 Reverse Split shares were reclassified and combined. The 2024 Reverse Split shall also apply to any outstanding securities or rights convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Common Stock of the Corporation and all references to such Common Stock in agreements, arrangements, documents and plans relating thereto or any option or right to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be references to the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, after giving effect to the 2024 Reverse Split.”\n\nThis Certificate of Amendment shall become effective at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on _____ __, 2024.\n\n* _ * _ * _ *\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its duly authorized officer, and the foregoing facts stated herein are true and correct, in each case as of this _____ day of __________, 2024.\n\nSu-Leng Tan Lee  \n---  \nChief Executive Officer  \n  \n1 Reverse Stock Split ratio to be determined. \n\n48  \n---\n"

In all cases where the duties of any officer, agent or employee are not prescribed by the bylaws or by the board, such officer, agent or employee shall follow the orders and instructions of (a) the president, or if a chairman of the board has been elected, then (b) the chairman. A Chairman of the Board, if there is one, will preside over meetings of the shareholders and the Board of Directors. Except as required by law, the Chairman of the Board possesses the same power as the President of the Corporation to sign all agreements, documents, certificates and other instruments as an officer of the Corporation. The Chairman of the Board may perform such other duties and have such powers as assigned to him by the Board of Directors.\n\n**Section 4.2.** **Election and Term in Office.** The officers shall be elected by the board annually at the first meeting held after each annual meeting of the shareholders.
