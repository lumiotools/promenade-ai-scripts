North America with Private Networks and Small Service Providers; Expected to be Accretive (Non-GAAP) By the End of 2024_\n\n**Rosh Ha'ain, Israel, December, 5, 2023 ‚Äì Ceragon Networks Ltd.**(NASDAQ: CRNT), the global innovator and leading solutions provider of 5G wireless transport, today announced that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of Siklu, a provider of multi-Gigabit ‚Äúwireless fiber‚Äù connectivity in urban, suburban and rural areas. The acquisition creates a more comprehensive, end-to-end offering ideally targeted to small service providers and [private networks ](/blog/riding-the-millimeter-wave-for-high-speed-data-in-private-networks)around the world. In particular, the combination gives Ceragon immediate access to Siklu‚Äôs established leadership in the millimeter-wave market in North America including its Fixed Wireless Access offering**.**\n\nDoron Arazi, Ceragon CEO, said ‚ÄúThis acquisition is expected to accelerate our growth strategy by expanding our presence with the fastest-growing segments of the market and enhancing our end-to-end solutions to better address the evolving needs of private networks. In addition, I expect that this acquisition will have a positive impact on our gross margins in the near-term and our profitability in the intermediate to long term. We welcome the talented and experienced Siklu team to Ceragon, and integration initiatives are underway and progressing according to plan.‚Äù\n\nRonen Ben-Hamou, Siklu‚Äôs CEO, has joined Ceragon‚Äôs management team, utilizing his experience to help with a smooth integration.\n\nThe terms of the transaction are substantially in-line with the considerations previously disclosed. \n\nCeragon expects the acquisition will increase its 2024 revenue by approximately $25-$29 million.

Inclusive of these business improvements, management anticipates the transaction to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings by the second half of 2024. Ceragon expects to include the Siklu acquisition in its 2024 guidance, to be provided, in combination with the release of Ceragon‚Äôs fourth quarter results, in early 2024.\n\nAs part of this transaction, Ceragon expanded its total loan credit facility by $5 million to $77 million in total, and Siklu‚Äôs primary lender joined Ceragon‚Äôs lending consortium.\n\n**About Ceragon Networks**\n\nCeragon Networks Ltd.

Presence With Private Networks and Small Service Providers in North America\n\nOctober 24, 2023\n\n_Expected to be Accretive (Non-GAAP) By the End of 2024_\n\n_Expected to Increase Ceragon‚Äôs Global Market Share in the mmW Market and Augment Offering with PtMP Solutions, Primarily for Fixed Wireless Access_\n\n_Company to Host Conference Call October 24 at 8:30 a.m. ET_\n\n**Rosh Ha'ain, Israel, October, 24, 2023 ‚Äì Ceragon Networks Ltd.**(NASDAQ: CRNT), the global innovator and leading solutions provider of 5G wireless transport, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Siklu, a provider of multi-Gigabit ‚Äúwireless fiber‚Äù connectivity in urban, suburban and rural areas, for an enterprise value of $13-15 million. As consideration to Siklu‚Äôs shareholders, Ceragon will issue approximately 1.5 million ordinary shares. Ceragon is expected to assume financial liabilities of approximately $10-12 million, of which approximately $2.5 million are classified as long-term debt.\n\nCeragon is expected to generate approximately $25-$29 million in incremental 2024 revenue from this acquisition. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to the consolidated gross margins of Ceragon as Siklu‚Äôs margins are at levels significantly higher than Ceragon‚Äôs historical margins. Ceragon management expects the combination to improve Siklu‚Äôs results by leveraging Ceragon‚Äôs working capital management capabilities, as well as expanded profitability following synergies. Inclusive of these business improvements, management anticipates the transaction to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings by the second half of 2024.\n\nDoron Arazi, Ceragon CEO, said ‚ÄúWe expect this combination to accelerate our growth strategy, by improving our key financial metrics and reducing customer concentration in the short and long run. We have identified near-term opportunities to bring Siklu products to regions and customers where Ceragon has an established presence, and, for the longer term, to combine Ceragon products to create a more comprehensive offering primarily to [private networks ](/blog/riding-the-millimeter-wave-for-high-speed-data-in-private-networks)and small service providers in general, and leveraging Siklu‚Äôs millimeter-wave leadership position in North America to increase our presence in this key market in particular.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúIn addition to increasing our market share in the millimeter wave bands, which is anticipated to be the growth segment within wireless transport market in the coming years, this acquisition is expected to provide us with an entry point to PtMP technology in general and Fixed Wireless Access in particular,‚Äù added Mr. Arazi. \n\nAs part of this transaction, Ceragon will expand its total loan credit facility by $5 million to $77 million total, and Siklu‚Äôs primary lender will join Ceragon‚Äôs lending consortium.\n\nOperating in the millimeter wave bands since 2008, Siklu‚Äôs wireless solutions have been used by service providers (primarily small ones), Private Networks and system integrators for many years for providing Wireless Transport and Access solutions. Siklu has deployed over 300,000 outdoor antenna units to date in over 50 countries. Siklu has been the leader in market share of [E-band](/blog/e-band-market-growth) installations in the US for the last three years. The Company has approximately 60 employees globally, including deep technical expertise in radio frequency communications and PtMP technology. Siklu is known in the industry for rapid deployments, ease of use solutions, robust testing capabilities and innovation, traits that align well with Ceragon.\n\n‚ÄúSiklu has built an impressive team, with deep technical expertise and an enviable corporate culture, along with industry leading technology in the markets it serves,‚Äù added Arazi. \n\nMr. Ronen Ben Hamou, Siklu‚Äôs CEO, added, ‚ÄúWe see Ceragon as the perfect partner for Siklu, in both technology, market, and cultural fit.‚Äù\n\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Ceragon expects the deal to close by the end of 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nCeragon Networks will host a Zoom web conference with analysts and investors today, October 24, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Historical facts and past operating\nresults are not intended to mean that future performances or results for any period will necessarily match or exceed those of any prior year.\nForward Looking Statements.\nThis presentation contains statements that constitute ‚Äúforward-looking statements‚Äù within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of Ceragon‚Äôs management about Ceragon‚Äôs business, financial condition, results of operations, micro and macro market trends and\nother issues addressed or reflected therein. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: projections of demand, revenues, net income, gross margin, capital expenditures and liquidity, competitive pressures, order\ntiming, supply chain and shipping, components availability; growth prospects, product development, financial resources, cost savings and other financial and market matters. You may identify these and other forward-looking statements by the use of words such as\n‚Äúmay‚Äù, ‚Äúplans‚Äù, ‚Äúanticipates‚Äù, ‚Äúbelieves‚Äù, ‚Äúestimates‚Äù, ‚Äútargets‚Äù, ‚Äúexpects‚Äù, ‚Äúintends‚Äù, ‚Äúpotential‚Äù or the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\nAlthough we believe that the projections reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be obtained or that any deviations therefrom will not be material. Such forward-\nlooking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause Ceragon‚Äôs future results or performance to differ materially from those anticipated, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties\ninclude, but are not limited to: the effects of the evolving nature of the war situation in Israel and the related evolving regional conflicts; the effects of global economic trends, including recession, rising inflation, rising interest rates, commodity price increases and\nfluctuations, commodity shortages and exposure to economic slowdown; risks associated with delays in the transition to 5G technologies and in the 5G rollout; risks relating to the concentration of our business on a limited number of large mobile operators and the\nfact that the significant weight of their ordering, compared to the overall ordering by other customers, coupled with inconsistent ordering patterns, could negatively affect us; risks resulting from the volatility in our revenues, margins and working capital needs;\ndisagreements with tax authorities regarding tax positions that we have taken could result in increased tax liabilities; the high volatility in the supply needs of our customers, which from time to time lead to delivery issues and may lead to us being unable to timely\nfulfil our customer commitments; and such other risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results of operation, as further detailed in Ceragon‚Äôs most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F, as published on March 21, 2024, as well as other documents\nthat may be subsequently filed by Ceragon from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Ceragon does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after\nthe date of this release unless required by law.\nWhile we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this press release, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future,\nabout which we cannot be certain.

Hosting today‚Äôs call\n20 is Doron Arazi, Ceragon‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer and Ronen Stein, Chief\n21 Financial Officer.\n22\n23 Before we start, I would like to note that certain statements made on\n24 this call, including projected financial information and other results and\n25 the company‚Äôs future initiatives, future events, business outlook,\n26 development efforts and their potential outcome, anticipated progress\n27 and plans, results and timelines and other financial and accounting-\n28 related matters, constitute ‚Äúforward-looking statements‚Äù within the\n29 meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities\n30 Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the safe-harbor provisions of the\n31 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n32\n33 Ceragon intends forward-looking terminology, such as ‚Äúmay‚Äù, ‚Äúplans‚Äù,\n34 ‚Äúanticipates‚Äù, ‚Äúbelieves‚Äù, ‚Äúestimates‚Äù, ‚Äútargets‚Äù, ‚Äúexpects‚Äù, ‚Äúintends‚Äù,\n35 ‚Äúpotential‚Äù or the negative of such terms, or other comparable\n36 terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these\n37 identifying words.\n38\n39 Such statements reflect current expectations, and assumptions of\n40 Ceragon‚Äôs management-- actual results may differ materially, as they are\n41 subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual\n42 results to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking\n43 statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n44 The effects of the evolving nature of the war situation in Israel and the\n45 related evolving regional conflicts; the effects of global economic trends,\n46 including recession, rising inflation, rising interest rates, commodity price\n47 increases and fluctuations, commodity shortages and exposure to\n48 economic slowdown; risks associated with delays in the transition to 5G\n49 technologies and in the 5G rollout; risks relating to the concentration of\n50 our business on a limited number of large mobile operators and the fact\n51 that the significant weight of their ordering, compared to the overall\n52 ordering by other customers, coupled with inconsistent ordering\n53 patterns, could negatively affect us; risks resulting from the volatility in\n54 our revenues, margins and working capital needs; disagreements with\n55 tax authorities regarding tax positions that we have taken could result in\n56 increased tax liabilities; the high volatility in the supply needs of our\n57 customers, which from time to time lead to delivery issues and may lead\n58 to us being unable to timely fulfil our customer commitments; and such\n59 other risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results\n60 of operation, as further detailed in Ceragon‚Äôs most recent Annual Report\n61 on Form 20-F, as published on March 21, 2024, as well as other\n62 documents that may be subsequently filed by Ceragon from time to time\n63 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n64\n65 Forward-looking statements relate to the date initially made, and they\n66 are not predictions of future events or results, and there can be no\n67 assurance that they will prove to be accurate, and Ceragon undertakes\n68 no obligation to update them.\n69\n70 Ceragon‚Äôs public filings are available on the Securities and Exchange\n71 Commission‚Äôs website at www.sec.gov, and may also be obtained from\n72 Ceragon‚Äôs website at www.ceragon.com.\n73\n74 Also, today‚Äôs call will include certain non-GAAP numbers. For a\n75 reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the table\n76 attached to the press release that was issued earlier today which is\n77 posted on the Investor Relations section of Ceragon‚Äôs website.\n78\n79 With that I will now turn the call over to Doron ‚Äì Doron the call is yours\n80\n81 Doron Arazi\n82\n83 Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.\n84\n85 Ceragon delivered another strong quarter in the third quarter of 2024,\n86 benefitting from continued execution and from robust demand ‚Äì\n87 especially in India. We achieved our targets for growth and profitability\n88 and narrowed our full-year outlook, maintaining the midpoint but\n89 putting a finer point on the range.\n90\n91 Increasingly, diversification is playing an important role in our success.\n92 The geographical diversification has already proven itself this quarter,\n93 while we also make progress in diversifying our business into private\n94 network business.\n95\n96 For example, in this quarter we added four new Private Networks\n97 customers to our customer base. And since the beginning of the year we\n98 have penetrated 16 new Private Networks customers, representing\n99 approximately $11.5 million in incremental bookings from customers in\n100 the private networks sector.\n101\n102\n103 We are also making good progress in our product roadmap. For example:\n104 ‚Ä¢ We have generated meaningful orders from our new IP50EX, and\n105 increased interest in our Upcoming IP-50EX Premium that is about\n106 to be released shortly. This product is intended to use mmW\n107 frequency over a much longer distance, exploiting the high-\n108 capacity advantage of these frequencies and reducing total cost of\n109 ownership.\n110 ‚Ä¢ We have started a soft promotion of our first Neptune-based\n111 product, the IP-100E, and have already seen very positive feedback.\n112 The first version of this product is intended to deliver 25Gps\n113 capacity in a single box with a compelling total cost of ownership\n114 profile. We intend to present the first units of this product at the\n115 Mobile World Congress.\n116 ‚Ä¢ We have recently started multiple new POCs for our Network\n117 Digital Twin and the initial feedback is very positive.\n118\n119 I‚Äôd now like to provide an overview of our Q3 highlights by region. Noting\n120 that on today‚Äôs call we will focus primarily on activities in North America\n121 and India, the two regions that have, and we expect will continue to\n122 have, the greatest impact on our results in the near term.\n123\n124 In North America, revenue was $24.5 million. In the private networks\n125 segment we have built a very strong pipeline and are working to leverage\n126 our completed projects, to build our brand in this domain. In fact, our\n127 success with the City of Cincinnati continues to be a case study\n128 deployment for us and the level of satisfaction is also driving proactive\n129 references from existing customers to new potential customers, adding\n130 to our funnel of opportunities. We are also leveraging Siklu‚Äôs strong\n131 brand in the Enterprise Security domain for attaining more business.\n132 Our bookings for private networks declined in the quarter compared to\n133 the prior quarter. We believe this was a timing factor, associated with\n134 seasonality and longer sell cycles and not a demand factor, as supported\n135 by the healthy funnel we have built. We anticipate private networks\n136 playing an increased role in our growth going forward.\n137\n138 In communications service providers segment, Q3 has demonstrated\n139 some slowdown in the ordering pace primarily from Tier1 customers,\n140 similar to the dynamic some of our peers have mentioned. Following\n141 multiple discussions with our main customer, we believe this was a short-\n142 term phenomenon, relating mostly to timing of network build over the\n143 year. We are off to a much stronger start in the fourth quarter related to\n144 bookings, as we have received a substantial value of orders which\n145 supports our current assessment.\n146\n147 In India, revenue was $50.5 million, an all-time record quarter for\n148 Ceragon. We have been shipping and deploying equipment related to\n149 both, our long standing customer as well as the new customer we won\n150 in Q4 2023. These deployments are supporting both customers in their\n151 expansion of 4G and 5G networks.\n152\n153 In addition, due to our technological strength and market leader\n154 position, we are further growing our business in India and diversifying to\n155 another customer that recently announced a multi-billion dollar project\n156 for upgrading its network to 4G and 5G. Since Q3, we have received more\n157 than $18 million dollars in orders from this customer for microwave\n158 products, further increasing substantially our market share. We expect\n159 more orders from this customer in the coming quarters for our\n160 Microwave as well as our E-Band solution.\n161\n162 Since participating in the India Mobile Congress, we are encouraged by\n163 the increasing level of traction we are receiving in India and see large\n164 opportunities for 2025. We believe that we will see much higher demand\n165 for E-Band products in 2025 and our IP-50EX Advanced provides\n166 capabilities that fit the specific needs of the Indian market, so we are\n167 very well positioned to capitalize on incremental growth opportunities.\n168\n169 Since there are multiple discussions about the general business\n170 environment, I would like to share with you our observations. Indeed,\n171 we have seen a slowdown in certain public network domains outside of\n172 India. We believe this is primarily driven by the global economy and the\n173 level of demand for 5G by network users. In addition, in Latin America,\n174 Africa and some countries in Asia PAC, Chinese competition is very fierce\n175 in these regions, driving business softness there. In these regions, we are\n176 increasing our focus on the private networks segment where there is\n177 lower Chinese presence.\n178\n179 We also see an interesting opportunity in the current market conditions\n180 as multiple service providers are now focusing on Fixed subscriber\n181 growth, and using wireless technology with 5G high frequencies. We are\n182 in multiple discussions with large operators exploring opportunities to\n183 leverage Siklu‚Äôs PtMP technology to address this increasing need in other\n184 frequencies.\n185\n186 With that, I‚Äôll turn the call over to Ronen Stein, our CFO, to discuss the\n187 results in more detail. Ronen, over to you.\n188\n189 Ronen Stein\n190\n191 Thank you Doron, and good morning, everyone.\n192\n193 Doron spoke to our revenue diversification, an important strategic point,\n194 and he also mentioned our ability to extract operating leverage from our\n195 business model. I‚Äôd like to highlight the operating leverage, as we drove\n196 increased operating income even with modest gross margin\n197 compression.\n198\n199 To help you understand the results, I will be referring primarily to non-\n200 GAAP financials. For more information regarding our use of non-GAAP\n201 financial measures, including reconciliations of these measures, we refer\n202 you to today‚Äôs press release.\n203\n204 Let me now review the actual results:\n205\n206 Revenues were $102.7 million, up 17.7% from $87.3 million in Q3 2023.\n207 Our strongest regions in terms of revenues for the quarter were India\n208 and North America with $50.5 and $24.5 million, respectively. Our third\n209 strongest region in terms of revenues was EMEA with $14.9 million.\n210\n211 We had three customers in the third quarter that contributed more than\n212 10% of our revenues.\n213\n214 Gross profit for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $35.2 million,\n215 an increase of 15.9% compared to $30.4 million in Q3 2023. Our non-\n216 GAAP gross margin was 34.3% compared with gross margin of 34.9% in\n217 Q3 2023. We continued to achieve high gross margins despite the change\n218 in regional revenue mix. We achieved this by increasing revenues and\n219 recognizing continued improvement in product costs. We also maintain\n220 control over our fixed costs, all of which had a positive effect. Our gross\n221 margins may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, due to\n222 changes in product and regional mix.\n223\n224 As for our operating expenses:\n225\n226 In general, operating expenses in 2024 fully include the impact of the\n227 Siklu acquisition at the end of 2023 and thus impact the comparison to\n228 2023 operating expenses.\n229\n230 Research & Development expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP\n231 basis were $8.6 million, up from $7.3 million in Q3 2023. As a percentage\n232 of revenue, our R&D expenses were 8.4% in the third quarter compared\n233 to 8.3% in the third quarter last year.\n234\n235 Sales & Marketing expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis\n236 were $10.4 million, up from $9.7 million in Q3 2023. As a percentage of\n237 revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 10.1% in the third quarter\n238 compared to 11.1% in the third quarter last year.\n239\n240 General and Administrative expenses for the third quarter on a non-\n241 GAAP basis were $0.4 million, compared to $5.5 million in Q3 2023. As a\n242 percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were less than 1% in the third\n243 quarter compared to 6.2% in the third quarter last year. The main reason\n244 for the reduction in G&A is the impact of approximately $5.1 million\n245 benefit related to payments on account of a debt settlement agreement\n246 reached with a South American customer, for which we accounted a\n247 credit-loss at the end of 2022. This payment reduced our G&A expenses\n248 in the quarter.\n249\n250 I‚Äôd note that Siklu has been successfully integrated in the first half of\n251 2024 and therefore we have not recorded any integration costs related\n252 to Siklu in our GAAP operating expenses.\n253\n254 Operating income for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $15.8\n255 million compared with $8.0 million for Q3 2023. As a percentage of\n256 revenues, non-GAAP operating income was 15.4% in the third quarter\n257 compared to 9.2% in the third quarter last year.\n258\n259 Without the approximately $5.1 million debt collection benefit included\n260 in the G&A, non-GAAP operating income would be $10.8 million and as\n261 a percentage of revenues 10.5%.\n262\n263 Financial and Other Expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis\n264 were $1.2 million, positively impacted from favorable foreign exchange\n265 changes and to a lesser extent reduction in interest expenses, as we\n266 continue to strengthen our balance sheet.\n267\n268 Our tax expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $0.6\n269 million.\n270\n271 Net income for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $14.1 million,\n272 or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $5.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted\n273 share for Q3 2023.\n274\n275 Without the approximately $5.1 million benefit related to the debt\n276 collection included in the G&A, non-GAAP net income would be $9.0\n277 million or $0.10 per diluted share.\n278\n279 As for our balance sheet:\n280\n281 Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $34.0 million,\n282 compared to $28.2 million at the end of 2023. Short-term loans were\n283 $25.2 million compared to $32.6 million as of December 31, 2023.\n284 Therefore, we shifted to net positive cash of $8.8 million compared to a\n285 negative net cash position of $4.4 million at December 31, 2023. We\n286 generated significant cash in the quarter, and continue to reduce our\n287 debt as a result. We believe we have cash and facilities that are sufficient\n288 for our operations and working capital needs.\n289\n290 Our inventory at the end of Q3 2024 was $59.8 million, down from $68.8\n291 million at the end of December 2023. The reduction is mainly related to\n292 our continued efforts since 2023 to streamline inventory levels following\n293 the improvement in components availability, and substantial shipments\n294 to India. We continue to monitor inventory levels, taking into\n295 consideration the improvements in the availability of components and\n296 expected changes in demand.\n297\n298 Our trade receivables at the end of Q3 2024 are at $121.6 million, as\n299 compared to $104.3 million at the end of December 2023.\n300\n301 Our DSO now stands at 118 days.\n302\n303 As for our cashflow:\n304\n305 Net cash flow generated by operations and investing activities in the\n306 third quarter of 2024 was $10.7 million.\n307\n308 We are reiterating the midpoint of our full-year outlook. For 2024, we\n309 expect revenue of $390 million to $400 million, representing growth of\n310 12% to 15% compared to 2023. This guidance includes the contribution\n311 from Siklu. You will note that we have narrowed the expected range,\n312 increasing the bottom-end of the range by $5 million and decreasing the\n313 top-end by a similar amount, leaving the midpoint unchanged. This\n314 reflects our visibility with just two months left in the year. Non-GAAP\n315 operating margins are targeted to be at least 10% at the mid-point of the\n316 revenue guidance. As a result, we expect increased non-GAAP profit,\n317 representing another record year, and positive free cash flow for the full\n318 year of 2024.\n319\n320 With that, I now open the call for your questions. Operator?\n321\n322 Doron‚Äôs Closing Remarks\n323\n324 Ceragon continues to focus on its growth initiatives, primarily mmW\n325 products, Private Networks and Managed Services and improves its\n326 strategic position in the market. We are adding new customers each\n327 quarter and growing our addressable market. Short-term fluctuations in\n328 buying patterns in the US, likely related to election concerns, have not\n329 diminished our current outlook, and we are making up for these\n330 fluctuations and the headwinds in other regions by our strong business\n331 in India. With our healthy funnel of opportunities, we expect that the\n332 ramp up in our Private Networks business, especially in the regions\n333 suffering from head winds, will help resume growth in the longer run.\n334\n335 Our new products and solutions as well as Neptune based future product\n336 are gaining meaningful traction and positive feedback respectively.\n337 These market signals, together with our longer-term product roadmap\n338 are building our confidence in long-term growth as they are expected to\n339 result in increasing market share in our space.\n340\n341 I look forward to updating you further on our next quarterly call.\n342\n343 Have a good day everyone."
