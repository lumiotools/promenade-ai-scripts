The Company’s management will conduct a conference call with related slides today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results and management’s outlook for the year.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * GAAP net income of $3.1 million, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in Q3 2023\n  * Adjusted net income of $3.5 million, compared to $200 thousand in Q3 2023, an increase of 1,610%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million, compared to $3.2 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 111%\n  * Free cash flow of $5.4 million, compared to $1.1 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 405%, highest ever achieved by the Company\n  * Revenue of $28.5 million, compared to $29.3 million in Q3 2023, a decrease of 2.5%\n\n\n\n**Year-to-date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * GAAP net income of $4.6 million, compared to a net loss of $5.0 million in the same period last year\n\n\n  * Adjusted net income of $6.6 million, compared to $4.0 million in the same period last year, an increase of 68%\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million, compared to $11.3 million in the same period last year, an increase of 50%\n\n\n  * Free cash flow of $10.3 million, compared to $2.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of 328%, highest ever achieved by the Company\n\n\n  * Revenue of $82.6 million, compared to $88.6 million in the same period last year, a decrease of 6.8%\n\n\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Plans to resume dividends on March 15, 2025 for Series A and B Preferred Stock\n  * Fully repaid the Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) credit facility balance, which was $10 million on January 1, 2024, utilizing internally generated free cash flow\n  * Reduced the SVB credit facility limit to $10 million, thereby reducing banking fees by $140,000\n  * CareCloud’s Series A Preferred Stock Special Proxy was approved by the shareholders, which will provide additional protection to Series A shareholders in the future, and eventually reduce cash requirements for future dividend payments by approximately $2.5 million a year\n\n\n\n“We’re proud to have achieved our profitability targets, underscored by the full repayment of our credit facility through internally generated cash flow,” said A. Hadi Chaudhry, CEO of CareCloud. “Our disciplined strategy and execution is further strengthened by our integration of generative AI, which enhances clinical workflows, improves documentation accuracy, and reduces manual administrative tasks. As we advance our AI capabilities, we expect these efficiencies to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2025, positioning us well for long-term value creation.”\n\n“We are succeeding at transforming our cost structure and positioning CareCloud for future growth,” said Stephen Snyder, President of CareCloud. “We are very pleased to report that we have improved year-over-year free cash flow by 328%, a new record for CareCloud. Futher, we anticipate resuming dividend payments on our preferred shares in March 2025, achieving a significant goal we articulated at the beginning of the year.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter 2024 was $28.5 million, compared to $29.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, the majority of this slight decline was due to the non-recurring professional services.\n\nThird quarter 2024 GAAP net income was $3.1 million, as compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in the same period last year. The GAAP net loss was $0.04 per share, based on the net loss attributable to common shareholders, which takes into account the preferred stock dividends earned, whether or not they were declared or paid during the quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2024 was $6.8 million, or 24% of revenue, compared to $3.2 million in the same period last year, an increase of 111%.\n\nNorman Roth, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller, commented “this is our second consecutive quarter returning to positive GAAP net income and our largest quarterly net income since Q4 2021. It was also the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA we have reported in two years. We were able to use the profits and cash flows we generated to fully pay the outstanding balance on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit. This will reduce interest costs in the future and allowed us to reduce the size of our $25 million line of credit, giving us additional financial flexibility, with no concern about needing to satisfy bank covenants. We have accomplished what we set out to achieve in 2024, leaving ourselves in a strong position for 2025 to execute on our strategic and growth objectives.”\n\n**_Nine Month 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nRevenue for the first nine months of 2024 was $82.6 million, compared to $88.6 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, the Company’s GAAP net income was $4.6 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5.0 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nDuring this period, adjusted EBITDA was $16.9 million, an increase of $5.6 million from $11.3 million in the same period last year.\n\n**_Cash Balances and Capital_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $2.8 million of cash.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\nWhile management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of our business operations, investors are reminded to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and management may utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Loss)**\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our “adjusted EBITDA” to our GAAP net income (loss).\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n($ in thousands)  \nNet revenue | $ | 28,546 | $ | 29,280 | $ | 82,598 | $ | 88,643  \nGAAP net income (loss) | 3,122 | (2,749 | ) | 4,555 | (4,982 | )  \nProvision for income taxes | 41 | 57 | 119 | 204  \nNet interest expense | 162 | 300 | 764 | 705  \nForeign exchange (gain) loss / other expense | (57 | ) | 426 | 244 | 609  \nStock-based compensation expense (benefit), net of restructuring costs | 252 | 1,209 | (191 | ) | 3,783  \nDepreciation and amortization | 3,241 | 3,903 | 10,885 | 10,282  \nTransaction and integration costs | 12 | 91 | 35 | 270  \nLoss on lease terminations, unoccupied lease charges and restructuring costs | 67 | 8 | 505 | 430  \nAdjusted EBITDA | **$** | **6,840** | **$** | **3,245** | **$** | **16,916** | **$** | **11,301**  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Income to GAAP Operating Income (Loss)**\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP “adjusted operating income” and non-GAAP “adjusted operating margin” to our GAAP operating income (loss) and GAAP operating margin.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n($ in thousands)  \nNet revenue | $ | 28,546 | $ | 29,280 | $ | 82,598 | $ | 88,643  \nGAAP net income (loss) | 3,122 | (2,749 | ) | 4,555 | (4,982 | )  \nProvision for income taxes | 41 | 57 | 119 | 204  \nNet interest expense | 162 | 300 | 764 | 705  \nOther (income) expense -

However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of CareCloud and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\n\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and non-GAAP adjusted net income to provide an understanding of aspects of operating results before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because this measure excludes non-cash expenses as well as expenses pertaining to investing or financing transactions. Management defines “adjusted EBITDA” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net interest expense, other (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges and changes in contingent consideration.\n\nManagement defines “non-GAAP adjusted operating income” as the sum of GAAP operating income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges and changes in contingent consideration, and “non-GAAP adjusted operating margin” as non-GAAP adjusted operating income divided by net revenue.\n\nManagement defines “non-GAAP adjusted net income” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, other (income) expense, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges, changes in contingent consideration, any tax impact related to these preceding items and income tax expense related to goodwill, and “non-GAAP adjusted net income per share” as non-GAAP adjusted net income divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.\n\nManagement defined “free cash flow” as the sum of net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and cash used to develop capitalized software and other intangible assets.\n\nManagement considers all of these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance.\n\nIn addition to items routinely excluded from non-GAAP EBITDA, management excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:\n\n_Foreign exchange loss / other expense_. Other expense is excluded because foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating expenses are expenditures that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expense is partially outside of our control. Foreign currency gains and losses are based on global market factors which are unrelated to our performance during the period in which the gains and losses are recorded.\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense (benefit)_. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) is excluded because this is primarily a non-cash expenditure that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred. Stock-based compensation expense includes cash-settled awards based on changes in the stock price.\n\n_Amortization of purchased intangible assets_. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, this item is not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\n\n_Transaction costs_. Transaction costs are upfront costs related to acquisitions and related transactions, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, and other upfront costs related to specific transactions. Management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\n\n_Integration costs_. Integration costs are severance payments for certain employees relating to our acquisitions and exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements. Accordingly, management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\n\n_Loss on lease terminations, unoccupied lease charges and restructuring costs_. Net loss on lease terminations represents the write-off of leasehold improvements and gains or losses as a result of an early lease termination. Unoccupied lease charges represent the portion of lease and related costs for vacant space not being utilized by the Company. Restructuring costs primarily consist of severance and separation costs associated with the optimization of the Company’s operations and profitability improvements. Management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\n\n_Income tax provision related to goodwill_. Income tax provision resulting from the amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions represents a charge (benefit) to record the tax effect resulting from amortizing goodwill over 15 years for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized for GAAP reporting. Any income tax expense is not anticipated to result in a cash payment.\n\n_Free cash flow._ Management believes that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net operating results as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, the Company's definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/9d778df6-85d6-44e6-a170-2d364bbd93fd/small/carecloud-logo-blue-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9d778df6-85d6-44e6-a170-2d364bbd93fd)\n\nSource: CareCloud, Inc \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.carecloud.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n  * [Solutions](https://www.carecloud.com/solutions/)\n    * [Revenue Cycle Management](https://www.carecloud.com/revenue-cycle-management-solution/)\n    * [Medical Coding](https://www.carecloud.com/medical-coding-and-credentialing/)\n    * [Practice Management](https://www.carecloud.com/practice-management-solution/)\n    * [Electronic Health Records](https://www.carecloud.com/electronic-health-records-system/)\n    * [Patient Experience](https://www.carecloud.com/breeze/)\n    * [Healthcare Analytics](https://www.carecloud.com/healthcare-analytics-software/)\n    * [Workforce Extension](https://www.carecloud.com/workforce-extension/)\n    * [Interoperability](https://www.carecloud.com/connector/)\n    * [Group Purchasing](https://www.carecloud.com/gpo/)\n    * [Professional Services](https://www.carecloud.com/solutions-professional-services/)\n    * [Release of Information](https://www.carecloud.com/release-of-information/)\n    * [Robotic Process Automation](https://www.carecloud.com/robotic-process-automation/)\n    * [Digital Health](https://www.carecloud.com/digital-health/)\n    * [Therapy Solution Suite](https://www.carecloud.com/therapy-solution-suite/)\n    * [EHR/PM for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/talkehr-for-therapy/)\n    * [Admit for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/admit-for-therapy/)\n    * [PXM for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/breeze-for-theraphy/)\n    * [RCM for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/rcm-for-therapy/)\n  * [By Customer](https://www.carecloud.com/practices/)\n    * [Small Medical Practices](https://www.carecloud.com/small-medical-practices/)\n    * [Large Medical Groups](https://www.carecloud.com/large-medical-groups/)\n    * [Health Systems](https://www.carecloud.com/health-systems/)\n    * [Academic Institutions](https://www.carecloud.com/academic-institutions/)\n    * [Medical Billing Companies](https://www.carecloud.com/medical-billing-company/)\n    * [Specialties](https://www.carecloud.com/specialties/)\n  * [Customer Stories](https://www.carecloud.com/case-studies/)\n  * [Learn](#Learn)\n    * [Resources](https://www.carecloud.com/resources/)\n    * [Telehealth](https://www.carecloud.com/telehealth-resource-center/)\n    * [Blog](https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/)\n    * [Events](https://www.carecloud.com/events-3/)\n  * [Company](#Company)\n    * [About Us](https://www.carecloud.com/company-about/)\n    * [Leadership](https://www.carecloud.com/leaderships/)\n    * [Investor Relations](https://ir.carecloud.com)\n    * [Acquisitions](https://ir.carecloud.com/acquisitions/)\n    * [Partner Ecosystem](https://www.carecloud.com/connect)\n    * [Newsroom](https://www.carecloud.com/news/in-the-news/)\n    * [Careers](https://www.carecloud.com/company-careers/)\n    * [Contact Us](https://www.carecloud.com/contact-us/)\n\n\n\n## GET IN TOUCH\n\n[1-877-342-7517](tel:1-877-342-7517)\n\n  * [ Follow us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/carecloud)\n  * [ CareCloud on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/carecloud/)\n  * [ Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CareCloud)\n  * [ CareCloud on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CareCloud)\n\n\n\n[LOGIN](https://www.carecloud.com/app) [LET'S CONNECT](https://www2.carecloud.com/schedule-demo)\n"

Additionally, CareCloud requested and secured a reduction in its borrowing fees and lowered its overall revolving credit facility limit.\n\n“We are thrilled to have reached this important strategic milestone,” said Norm Roth, Interim CFO and Corporate Controller of CareCloud. “We started 2024 with a $10 million outstanding balance and a clear goal to significantly increase our free cash flow, allowing us to fully pay down this debt. We are pleased to have accomplished this ahead of schedule, achieving a zero balance at the end of the third quarter.”\n\n“Along with eliminating the credit facility balance — which had been incurring interest expense since the beginning of the year — we sought and achieved a reduction in the available amount of our credit line. This reduction will lower the annual anniversary and unused revolving line facility fees. These savings amount to approximately $140,000 on an annual basis. Moreover, these cost reductions are a small part of a larger plan to accelerate free cashflow and revitalize our business model as we continue to strategically drive efficiencies across the organization,” said Roth.\n\nPursuant to the Company’s Ninth Loan Modification Agreement, dated October 25, 2024, with Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company (the “Agreement”), the Company continues to maintain an unused, but available, credit facility line of $10 million. The information contained in this press release is a summary of certain relevant portions of the Agreement and Form 8-K, which are filed with Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**About** **CareCloud**\n\nCareCloud brings disciplined innovation to the business of healthcare.

          "content": "Q3 2024\nRESULTS\nNasdaq Global Market: CCLD, CCLDP, CCLDO\nNovember 12, 2024\n©\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements relateto anticipated future events, future results of operations or future financial performance. In some cases, you can\nidentify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “could,” “intends,” “expects,” “plans,” “goals,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “predicts,” “possible,”\n“potential,” “target,” “approximately,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar terms and phrases. ​​\nOur operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combinationofwhich, could materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to\nbe correct. Forward-looking statements in this presentation include, without limitation, statements reflecting management’s expectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures, expected growth, including our ability to continue\nas a going concern, to raise additional capital and to succeed in our future operations, profitability and business outlook, increased sales and marketing expenses, and the expected results from the integration of our acquisitions.​​\nForward-looking statements are only current predictions and are subject to substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our (or our industry’s) actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to\nbe materially different from those anticipated by such statements. These factors include our ability to:​\n• Manage our growth, including acquiring, partnering with, and effectively integrating acquired businesses into our infrastructureand avoiding legal exposure and liabilities associated with acquired companies and assets;\n• Retain our clients and revenue levels, including effectively migrating new clients and maintaining or growing the revenue levelsof our new and existing clients;\n• Maintain operations in Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Sri Lanka (together, the “Offshore Offices”) in a manner that continues to enable us to offer competitively priced products and services;\n• Keep pace with a rapidly changing healthcare industry;\n• Consistently achieve and maintain compliance with a myriad of federal, state, foreign, local, payor and industry requirements, regulations, rules, laws and contracts;\n• Maintain and protect the privacy of confidential and protected Company, client and patient information;\n• Develop new technologies, upgrade and adapt legacy and acquired technologies to work with evolving industry standards and third-party software platforms and technologies, and protect and enforce all of these and other intellectual\nproperty rights;\n• Attract and retain key officers and employees, and the continued involvement of Mahmud Haq as Executive Chairman and A. Hadi Chaudhry as Chief Executive Officer, all of which are critical to our ongoing operations and growing our\nbusiness;\n• Realize the expected cost savings and benefits from our restructuring activities and structural cost reductions;\n• Comply with covenants contained in our credit agreement with our senior secured lender, Silicon Valley Bank, a division of FirstCitizens Bank, and other future debt facilities;\n• Resume and then continue to pay our monthly dividends to the holders of our Series A and Series B preferred stock;\n• Incorporate AI into our products faster and more successfully than our competitors, protecting the privacy of medical recordsand cybersecurity threats;\n• Compete with other companies developing products and selling services competitive with ours, and who may have greater resources and name recognition than we have;\n• Effectively integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure and operational in the event of a cyber-attack;\n• Respond to the uncertainty resulting from pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies and the impact they may have on our operations, the demand for our services, our projected results of operations, financial performance\nor other financial metrics or any of the foregoing risks and economic activity in general;\n• Keep and increase market acceptance of our products and services;\n• Adapt to changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.​\nIn this presentation, we disclose certain non-GAAP historical and projected financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding\ncertain items and expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results or do not reflect our normal business operations. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that such non-GAAP financial measures may not be\ndirectly comparable to those reported by other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP\nmeasures. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.​\nThe statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this presentation, and the Company does not assume any obligations to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the\ndate on which they were made.​\n© 1\nHosts for Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nMahmud Haq A.

The Company’s management will conduct a conference call with related slides today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results and management’s outlook for the year.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * GAAP net income of $3.1 million, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in Q3 2023\n  * Adjusted net income of $3.5 million, compared to $200 thousand in Q3 2023, an increase of 1,610%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million, compared to $3.2 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 111%\n  * Free cash flow of $5.4 million, compared to $1.1 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 405%, highest ever achieved by the Company\n  * Revenue of $28.5 million, compared to $29.3 million in Q3 2023, a decrease of 2.5%\n\n\n\n**Year-to-date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * GAAP net income of $4.6 million, compared to a net loss of $5.0 million in the same period last year\n\n\n  * Adjusted net income of $6.6 million, compared to $4.0 million in the same period last year, an increase of 68%\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million, compared to $11.3 million in the same period last year, an increase of 50%\n\n\n  * Free cash flow of $10.3 million, compared to $2.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of 328%, highest ever achieved by the Company\n\n\n  * Revenue of $82.6 million, compared to $88.6 million in the same period last year, a decrease of 6.8%\n\n\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Plans to resume dividends on March 15, 2025 for Series A and B Preferred Stock\n  * Fully repaid the Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) credit facility balance, which was $10 million on January 1, 2024, utilizing internally generated free cash flow\n  * Reduced the SVB credit facility limit to $10 million, thereby reducing banking fees by $140,000\n  * CareCloud’s Series A Preferred Stock Special Proxy was approved by the shareholders, which will provide additional protection to Series A shareholders in the future, and eventually reduce cash requirements for future dividend payments by approximately $2.5 million a year\n\n\n\n“We’re proud to have achieved our profitability targets, underscored by the full repayment of our credit facility through internally generated cash flow,” said A. Hadi Chaudhry, CEO of CareCloud. “Our disciplined strategy and execution is further strengthened by our integration of generative AI, which enhances clinical workflows, improves documentation accuracy, and reduces manual administrative tasks. As we advance our AI capabilities, we expect these efficiencies to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2025, positioning us well for long-term value creation.”\n\n“We are succeeding at transforming our cost structure and positioning CareCloud for future growth,” said Stephen Snyder, President of CareCloud. “We are very pleased to report that we have improved year-over-year free cash flow by 328%, a new record for CareCloud. Futher, we anticipate resuming dividend payments on our preferred shares in March 2025, achieving a significant goal we articulated at the beginning of the year.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter 2024 was $28.5 million, compared to $29.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, the majority of this slight decline was due to the non-recurring professional services.\n\nThird quarter 2024 GAAP net income was $3.1 million, as compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in the same period last year. The GAAP net loss was $0.04 per share, based on the net loss attributable to common shareholders, which takes into account the preferred stock dividends earned, whether or not they were declared or paid during the quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2024 was $6.8 million, or 24% of revenue, compared to $3.2 million in the same period last year, an increase of 111%.\n\nNorman Roth, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller, commented “this is our second consecutive quarter returning to positive GAAP net income and our largest quarterly net income since Q4 2021. It was also the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA we have reported in two years. We were able to use the profits and cash flows we generated to fully pay the outstanding balance on our Silicon Valley Bank line of credit. This will reduce interest costs in the future and allowed us to reduce the size of our $25 million line of credit, giving us additional financial flexibility, with no concern about needing to satisfy bank covenants. We have accomplished what we set out to achieve in 2024, leaving ourselves in a strong position for 2025 to execute on our strategic and growth objectives.”\n\n**_Nine Month 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nRevenue for the first nine months of 2024 was $82.6 million, compared to $88.6 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, the Company’s GAAP net income was $4.6 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5.0 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nDuring this period, adjusted EBITDA was $16.9 million, an increase of $5.6 million from $11.3 million in the same period last year.\n\n**_Cash Balances and Capital_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $2.8 million of cash.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\nWhile management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of our business operations, investors are reminded to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and management may utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Loss)**\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our “adjusted EBITDA” to our GAAP net income (loss).\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n($ in thousands)  \nNet revenue | $ | 28,546 | $ | 29,280 | $ | 82,598 | $ | 88,643  \nGAAP net income (loss) | 3,122 | (2,749 | ) | 4,555 | (4,982 | )  \nProvision for income taxes | 41 | 57 | 119 | 204  \nNet interest expense | 162 | 300 | 764 | 705  \nForeign exchange (gain) loss / other expense | (57 | ) | 426 | 244 | 609  \nStock-based compensation expense (benefit), net of restructuring costs | 252 | 1,209 | (191 | ) | 3,783  \nDepreciation and amortization | 3,241 | 3,903 | 10,885 | 10,282  \nTransaction and integration costs | 12 | 91 | 35 | 270  \nLoss on lease terminations, unoccupied lease charges and restructuring costs | 67 | 8 | 505 | 430  \nAdjusted EBITDA | **$** | **6,840** | **$** | **3,245** | **$** | **16,916** | **$** | **11,301**  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Income to GAAP Operating Income (Loss)**\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP “adjusted operating income” and non-GAAP “adjusted operating margin” to our GAAP operating income (loss) and GAAP operating margin.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n($ in thousands)  \nNet revenue | $ | 28,546 | $ | 29,280 | $ | 82,598 | $ | 88,643  \nGAAP net income (loss) | 3,122 | (2,749 | ) | 4,555 | (4,982 | )  \nProvision for income taxes | 41 | 57 | 119 | 204  \nNet interest expense | 162 | 300 | 764 | 705  \nOther (income) expense -

However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of CareCloud and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\n\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and non-GAAP adjusted net income to provide an understanding of aspects of operating results before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because this measure excludes non-cash expenses as well as expenses pertaining to investing or financing transactions. Management defines “adjusted EBITDA” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net interest expense, other (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges and changes in contingent consideration.\n\nManagement defines “non-GAAP adjusted operating income” as the sum of GAAP operating income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges and changes in contingent consideration, and “non-GAAP adjusted operating margin” as non-GAAP adjusted operating income divided by net revenue.\n\nManagement defines “non-GAAP adjusted net income” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, other (income) expense, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges, changes in contingent consideration, any tax impact related to these preceding items and income tax expense related to goodwill, and “non-GAAP adjusted net income per share” as non-GAAP adjusted net income divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.\n\nManagement defined “free cash flow” as the sum of net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and cash used to develop capitalized software and other intangible assets.\n\nManagement considers all of these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance.\n\nIn addition to items routinely excluded from non-GAAP EBITDA, management excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:\n\n_Foreign exchange loss / other expense_. Other expense is excluded because foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating expenses are expenditures that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expense is partially outside of our control. Foreign currency gains and losses are based on global market factors which are unrelated to our performance during the period in which the gains and losses are recorded.\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense (benefit)_. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) is excluded because this is primarily a non-cash expenditure that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred. Stock-based compensation expense includes cash-settled awards based on changes in the stock price.\n\n_Amortization of purchased intangible assets_. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, this item is not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\n\n_Transaction costs_. Transaction costs are upfront costs related to acquisitions and related transactions, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, and other upfront costs related to specific transactions. Management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\n\n_Integration costs_. Integration costs are severance payments for certain employees relating to our acquisitions and exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements. Accordingly, management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\n\n_Loss on lease terminations, unoccupied lease charges and restructuring costs_. Net loss on lease terminations represents the write-off of leasehold improvements and gains or losses as a result of an early lease termination. Unoccupied lease charges represent the portion of lease and related costs for vacant space not being utilized by the Company. Restructuring costs primarily consist of severance and separation costs associated with the optimization of the Company’s operations and profitability improvements. Management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\n\n_Income tax provision related to goodwill_. Income tax provision resulting from the amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions represents a charge (benefit) to record the tax effect resulting from amortizing goodwill over 15 years for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized for GAAP reporting. Any income tax expense is not anticipated to result in a cash payment.\n\n_Free cash flow._ Management believes that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net operating results as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, the Company's definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/9d778df6-85d6-44e6-a170-2d364bbd93fd/small/carecloud-logo-blue-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9d778df6-85d6-44e6-a170-2d364bbd93fd)\n\nSource: CareCloud, Inc \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.carecloud.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n  * [Solutions](https://www.carecloud.com/solutions/)\n    * [Revenue Cycle Management](https://www.carecloud.com/revenue-cycle-management-solution/)\n    * [Medical Coding](https://www.carecloud.com/medical-coding-and-credentialing/)\n    * [Practice Management](https://www.carecloud.com/practice-management-solution/)\n    * [Electronic Health Records](https://www.carecloud.com/electronic-health-records-system/)\n    * [Patient Experience](https://www.carecloud.com/breeze/)\n    * [Healthcare Analytics](https://www.carecloud.com/healthcare-analytics-software/)\n    * [Workforce Extension](https://www.carecloud.com/workforce-extension/)\n    * [Interoperability](https://www.carecloud.com/connector/)\n    * [Group Purchasing](https://www.carecloud.com/gpo/)\n    * [Professional Services](https://www.carecloud.com/solutions-professional-services/)\n    * [Release of Information](https://www.carecloud.com/release-of-information/)\n    * [Robotic Process Automation](https://www.carecloud.com/robotic-process-automation/)\n    * [Digital Health](https://www.carecloud.com/digital-health/)\n    * [Therapy Solution Suite](https://www.carecloud.com/therapy-solution-suite/)\n    * [EHR/PM for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/talkehr-for-therapy/)\n    * [Admit for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/admit-for-therapy/)\n    * [PXM for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/breeze-for-theraphy/)\n    * [RCM for Therapy](https://www.carecloud.com/rcm-for-therapy/)\n  * [By Customer](https://www.carecloud.com/practices/)\n    * [Small Medical Practices](https://www.carecloud.com/small-medical-practices/)\n    * [Large Medical Groups](https://www.carecloud.com/large-medical-groups/)\n    * [Health Systems](https://www.carecloud.com/health-systems/)\n    * [Academic Institutions](https://www.carecloud.com/academic-institutions/)\n    * [Medical Billing Companies](https://www.carecloud.com/medical-billing-company/)\n    * [Specialties](https://www.carecloud.com/specialties/)\n  * [Customer Stories](https://www.carecloud.com/case-studies/)\n  * [Learn](#Learn)\n    * [Resources](https://www.carecloud.com/resources/)\n    * [Telehealth](https://www.carecloud.com/telehealth-resource-center/)\n    * [Blog](https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/)\n    * [Events](https://www.carecloud.com/events-3/)\n  * [Company](#Company)\n    * [About Us](https://www.carecloud.com/company-about/)\n    * [Leadership](https://www.carecloud.com/leaderships/)\n    * [Investor Relations](https://ir.carecloud.com)\n    * [Acquisitions](https://ir.carecloud.com/acquisitions/)\n    * [Partner Ecosystem](https://www.carecloud.com/connect)\n    * [Newsroom](https://www.carecloud.com/news/in-the-news/)\n    * [Careers](https://www.carecloud.com/company-careers/)\n    * [Contact Us](https://www.carecloud.com/contact-us/)\n\n\n\n## GET IN TOUCH\n\n[1-877-342-7517](tel:1-877-342-7517)\n\n  * [ Follow us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/carecloud)\n  * [ CareCloud on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/carecloud/)\n  * [ Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CareCloud)\n  * [ CareCloud on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CareCloud)\n\n\n\n[LOGIN](https://www.carecloud.com/app) [LET'S CONNECT](https://www2.carecloud.com/schedule-demo)\n"
