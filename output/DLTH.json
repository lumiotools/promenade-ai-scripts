(dba, Duluth Trading Company) (“Duluth Trading” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DLTH), a lifestyle brand of men’s and women’s workwear, casual wear, outdoor apparel and accessories, today announced its financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended July 28, 2024.\n\n**Summary of the Second Quarter Ended July 28, 2024 **\n\n  * Net sales of 141.6 million increased 1.8% compared to the prior year second quarter\n  * Net loss of $3.7 million and adjusted net loss1 of $0.6 million, compared to net loss of $2.0 million in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net loss of $0.6 million excludes $1.6 million of restructuring expense and a $2.4 million non-recurring estimated sales tax expense accrual that is reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses\n  * EPS per diluted share of ($0.11); Adjusted EPS1 of ($0.02)\n  * Adjusted EBITDA2 increased $2.0 million from the prior year to $10.6 million, representing 7.5% of net sales\n\n\n\n1See Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss to adjusted EPS in the accompanying financial tables.2See Reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA in the accompanying financial tables.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam Sato commented, “We are pleased to have returned to top-line growth in the second quarter, while also expanding our gross margin as we begin to see the benefits of our product development and sourcing initiatives. During the quarter we saw a trend line improvement in both traffic and transactions with healthy shopper conversion, fueling 1.8% year-over-year net sales growth. The quarter strength was highlighted by product innovation wins including Dry on the Fly, Armachillo and DuluthFlex Fire Hose Sweat Management.\n\n“We entered the third quarter with a strong lineup of newness such as Duluth Reserve, Bullpen 3D and Souped up Sweats and we expanded our Plus size assortment including our successful Adjustabust, a bonded zip-front bra with a sleek silhouette and criss-crossed back offering extra support and security. On August 10th we successfully hosted our second underwear trade-up event engaging with existing and new customers throughout our local store markets. The event generated a lot of buzz and resulted in a jump in traffic, higher overall sales, and 40% of trade ups from our female shoppers, which remains a key strategic growth opportunity for Duluth.”\n\n![By Duluth Trading](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/258f8294-62c0-412d-b897-efc33dd32268/picture1.jpg)\n\nSato concluded, “From a longer-term structural update, we have successfully moved into phase two of our fulfillment center network plan to maximize productivity and capacity. The tremendous success we are seeing with our near fully automated fulfillment center in Adairsville, Georgia, which processed 58% of total company volume during the first of half of our fiscal year, allowed for the planned exit of our Dubuque fulfillment center this October. Importantly, we will begin to realize the SG&A benefits in Q4.”\n\n**Operating Results for the Second Quarter Ended July 28, 2024**\n\nNet sales increased 1.8% to $141.6 million, compared to $139.1 million in the same period a year ago. Direct to-consumer net sales increased by 5.6% to $91.7 million primarily driven by higher site conversion compared to the prior year. Retail store net sales decreased by 4.4% to $49.9 million due to slower store traffic, partially offset by strong conversion rates.\n\nGross profit increased to $74.0 million, or 52.3% of net sales up 90 basis points, compared to $71.5 million, or 51.4% of net sales, in the corresponding prior year period driven by our sourcing initiative.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.6% to $76.3 million, compared to $72.9 million in the same period a year ago. The increase included the $2.4 million non-recurring estimated sales tax expense. Excluding this non-recurring expense, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million to $73.9 million, representing 52.2% of net sales and leveraging 20 basis points compared to the prior year.\n\nAs part of the Company’s in-depth review of the retail portfolio strategy, fulfillment center network, and benchmarking to identify structural opportunities to improve operating margin, working capital, and asset efficiency, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company began phase two of the fulfillment center network plan to maximize productivity and capacity. As a result, the Company initiated a lease amendment for one of its legacy fulfillment centers to accelerate the lease expiration date from September 2030 to October 2024.\n\nThe Company expects to incur total restructuring expenses related to the lease amendment of $7.4 million during the second and third quarters of 2024, $1.6 million of which was recognized during the second quarter. The Company expects a total cash outlay of approximately $4.4 million related to this initiative, including $1.7 million to be paid in the current fiscal year.\n\nExiting the legacy facility is projected to reduce overhead expenses by approximately $1.2 million during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The Company expects an expense reduction of approximately $5.0 million and cash savings of $4.0 million annually. \n\nAs previously mentioned, during the third quarter last year, the Company went live with a highly automated fulfillment center in Adairsville, Georgia which now processes 58% of all online orders and replenishment volume. The Adairsville facility has shortened delivery times while driving lower cost per unit to fulfill an order, which was 32% of the cost of the three legacy fulfillment centers over the first half of the year. The success and productivity from the critical Adairsville facility investment has allowed the Company to accelerate phase two of its overall fulfillment center network plan.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nThe Company ended the quarter with $9.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, net working capital of $79.8 million, no outstanding debt on the Duluth Trading $200 million revolving line of credit and $209.8 million of liquidity.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 outlook, excluding restructuring expense and sales tax expense accrual:\n\n  * Net sales of approximately $640 million\n  * Adjusted EPS1 of approximately ($0.22) per diluted share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA2 of approximately $39 million\n  * Capital expenditures, inclusive of software hosting implementation costs, of approximately $25 million\n\n\n\n1See Reconciliation of forecasted net loss to forecasted adjusted net loss and forecasted adjusted net loss to forecasted adjusted EPS in the accompanying financial tables.2See Reconciliation of forecasted net loss to forecasted EBITDA and forecasted EBITDA to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA in the accompanying financial tables.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nA conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held on Thursday, August 29, 2024 at 9:30 am Eastern Time, to discuss the results and answer questions.\n\n  * Live conference call: 844-875-6915 (domestic) or 412-317-6711 (international)\n  * Conference call replay available through September 5, 2024: 877-344-7529 (domestic) or 412-317-0088 (international)\n  * Replay access code: 5705373\n  * Live and archived webcast: [ir.duluthtrading.com](http://ir.duluthtrading.com/)\n\n\n\nInvestors can pre-register for the earnings conference call to expedite their entry into the call and avoid waiting for a live operator.

Within this release, including the tables attached hereto, reference is made to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net loss and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). See attached table “Reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA,” for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended July 28, 2024, versus the three and six months ended July 30, 2023 and attached table “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss to Adjusted EPS,” for a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss to adjusted EPS for the three and six months ended July 28, 2024.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and frequently used by the financial community, which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS is a metric used by management and frequently used by the financial community, which provides insight into the effectiveness of our business strategies and to compare our performance against that of peer companies. Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS excludes restructuring expenses and a one-time estimated sales tax accrual that are not comparable from period to period.\n\nThe Company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this press release, including statements concerning Duluth Trading's plans, objectives, goals, beliefs, business strategies, future events, business conditions, its results of operations, financial position and its business outlook, business trends and certain other information herein, including statements under the heading “Fiscal 2024 Outlook” are forward-looking statements.
