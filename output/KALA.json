(NASDAQ:KALA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for rare and severe diseases of the eye, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We remain focused on advancing patient enrollment in our Phase 2b CHASE trial evaluating KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED and are targeting topline results in the second quarter of 2025,” said Mark Iwicki, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of KALA BIO. “We believe KPI-012 has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for PCED with the potential to address all underlying etiologies of this debilitating condition and provide a treatment option for a broad population of PCED patients. If successful, this trial may serve as the first of two pivotal trials in support of a BLA submission that could potentially revolutionize treatment options for patients with PCED.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights:**\n\nKALA’s innovative pipeline is based on its proprietary mesenchymal stem cell secretome (MSC-S) platform. KALA believes the multifactorial mechanism of action of its MSC-S platform technology may enable it to generate product candidates for a range of ocular orphan diseases and is evaluating the potential development of this technology for multiple rare, front- and back-of-the-eye diseases.\n\nKALA’s lead product candidate, KPI-012 contains growth factors, protease inhibitors, matrix proteins and neurotrophic factors to potentially correct the impaired corneal healing that is an underlying etiology of multiple severe ocular diseases.\n\nKALA is initially developing KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED, a persistent, non-healing corneal defect or wound that is refractory to conventional treatments which, if left untreated, can lead to significant complications, including infection, corneal perforation/scarring and vision loss. PCED has an estimated incidence of approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S., representing a potentially sizeable market opportunity as there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription products with a broad indication covering all underlying etiologies of PCED.\n\n  * KALA continues to enroll patients in the CHASE (Corneal Healing After SEcretome therapy) Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED and plans to report topline data in the second quarter of 2025. The Company has also initiated five clinical trial sites in Argentina with initiation of additional sites in Latin America in progress, subject to regulatory clearance. Contingent on positive results and subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, the Company believes the CHASE Phase 2b trial could potentially serve as the first of two pivotal studies required to support the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA.\n  * KALA is also exploring the potential of KPI-012 for additional rare, front-of-the-eye diseases, including Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD) and other corneal diseases. LSCD is characterized by the loss or deficiency of limbal epithelial stem cells, which can result in recurrent epithelial breakdown, conjunctivalization, inflammation, neovascularization and other sequalae that can lead to significant symptomology and a loss of corneal clarity and vision impairment. Like PCED, LSCD represents a potentially substantial market opportunity, with an estimated incidence of 100,000 patients in the U.S.\n\n\n\nKPI-014, KALA’s preclinical program to evaluate the utility of its MSC-S platform for inherited retinal degenerative diseases, contains neurotrophic factors, growth factors, anti-inflammatory or immune-modulatory factors and antioxidant inhibitors with the potential to protect and preserve retinal cell function. Secretomes have demonstrated a neuroprotective effect in both  _in vitro_ and  _in vivo_ models of retinal degeneration. KALA believes KPI-014 could offer a gene-agnostic approach for the treatment of rare inherited retinal diseases and has initiated preclinical studies to evaluate the utility of KPI-014 for conditions such as Retinitis Pigmentosa and Stargardt Disease.\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, KALA had cash and cash equivalents of $49.2 million, compared to $54.2 million as of June 30, 2024. This decrease reflects cash used in operations, partially offset by the $3.2 million of funds received under the CIRM award in August 2024. Based on its current plans, KALA anticipates that its cash resources as of September 30, 2024, and anticipated additional funding under the CIRM award, will enable it to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n**Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 202****4:**\n\n  * **G &A Expenses:** For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.4 million, compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation and employee-related costs.\n  * **R &D Expenses:** For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, research and development (R&D) expenses were $5.2 million, compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing costs related to KPI-012 development.\n  * **Loss / (Gain) on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration** : For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, in connection with the acquisition of Combangio, was $0.4 million, compared to a gain of $1.7 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes in discount rates, the passage of time and changes in the expected timing of payment.\n  * **Operating Loss:** For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, loss from operations was $10.0 million, compared to $8.8 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net loss was $9.0 million, or $1.93 per share, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million, or $3.41 per share, for the same period in 2023. The weighted average number of shares used to calculate net loss per share was 4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 202****4****:**\n\n  * **G &A Expenses:** For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G&A expenses were $14.1 million, compared to $15.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in administrative and professional service fees and in employee-related costs.\n  * **R &D Expenses:** For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were $16.8 million, compared to $13.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in KPI-012 development costs, as we advance the clinical development of KPI-012, an increase in employee-related costs and an increase in other research and development costs.\n  * **Gain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration** : For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration due to the final settlement of the liability in March 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration was $0.2 million.\n  * **Loss on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration** : For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the loss on fair value remeasurement of continent consideration, in connection with the Combangio acquisition, was $0.5 million, primarily due to changes in discount rates, the passage of time and changes in the expected timing and probability of payment.\n  * **Operating Loss:** For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss from operations was $31.5 million, compared to a loss of $30.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was $30.3 million, or $8.68 per share, compared to a net loss of $33.6 million, or $14.36 per share, for the same period in 2023. The weighted average number of shares used to calculate net loss per share was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About KALA BIO, Inc.**\n\nKALA is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for rare and severe diseases of the eye.
