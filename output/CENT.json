View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241125974807/en/>\n\n\"We have a lot to be proud of this year. We increased non-GAAP EPS, continued margin expansion, made significant progress on our Cost and Simplicity program, and achieved strong profits in our Pet segment and record cash flow for the company. We accomplished this despite continued soft demand across our Pet segment, in particular in durable pet products, and a difficult garden season,\" said Niko Lahanas, Central Garden & Pet's new CEO. \"While we expect the external environment to remain challenging, I am confident we have the right strategy and people in place to deliver profitable growth in fiscal 2025 and for the long term.\"\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales were $3.2 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the prior year, a decrease of 3%. Fiscal 2023 benefited from an additional week in the fourth quarter. Organic net sales decreased 4% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS in fiscal 2024 and the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business in fiscal 2023.\n\nNet sales for the Pet segment were $1.83 billion compared to $1.88 billion a year ago, a decrease of 2%. Pet organic net sales decreased 6%. Net sales for the Garden segment were $1.37 billion compared to $1.43 billion in the prior year, a decrease of 5%. Garden organic net sales decreased 1%.\n\nGross margin expanded by 90 basis points to 29.5% from 28.6% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin expanded by 110 basis points to 30.0% from 28.9% a year ago driven by productivity efforts and moderating inflation.\n\nOperating income was $185 million compared to $211 million in the prior year, a decrease of 12%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $223 million compared to $227 million a year ago. Operating margin was 5.8% compared to 6.4% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded to 7.0% from 6.9% a year ago due to improved gross margin and continued cost discipline in selling, general and administrative expense.\n\nNet interest expense was $38 million compared to $50 million in the prior year driven by higher interest income.\n\nOther expense was $5.1 million compared to other income of $1.5 million a year ago due to the impairment of two underperforming equity investments in the fourth quarter.\n\nNet income was $108 million compared to $126 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income increased to $142 million from $138 million a year ago. Earnings per share were $1.62 compared to $1.88 in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share increased to $2.13 from $2.07 a year ago.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $334 million compared to $343 million in the prior year.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 23.2% compared to 22.4% a year ago primarily due to an increase in the blended state income tax rate in the current year compared to the prior year.\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales were $669 million compared to $750 million a year ago, a decrease of 11%. The prior year quarter benefited from an extra week. Organic net sales decreased 13% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS and the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business.\n\nGross margin contracted by 110 basis points to 25.2% compared to 26.3% a year ago primarily driven by the impairment of grass seed inventory more than offsetting moderating inflation and productivity efforts. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin contracted by 60 basis points to 26.0% from 26.6% in the prior year.\n\nOperating loss was $32 million compared to operating income of $9 million a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $11 million compared to operating income of $12 million reflecting lower volumes, the inventory impairment, and the timing of expenses related to productivity and commercial initiatives. Operating margin was (4.8)% compared to 1.2% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin contracted to (1.7)% from 1.6% a year ago.\n\nOther expense was $6 million compared to $2 million in the prior year.\n\nNet interest expense was $6 million compared to $8 million a year ago.\n\nNet loss was $34 million compared to net income of $3 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss was $12 million compared to net income $5 million a year ago. Loss per share was $0.51 compared to earnings per share of $0.04 in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, loss per share was $0.18 compared to earnings per share of $0.08 a year ago.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $17 million compared to $42 million in the prior year.\n\n**Pet Segment Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales for the Pet segment were $435 million compared to $483 million in the prior year, a decrease of 10%. The decrease was primarily due to an extra week in the prior year quarter. Organic net sales decreased 14% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS.\n\nThe Pet segment’s operating income was $14 million compared to $43 million a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $35 million compared to $48 million in the prior year due to lower volume and the timing of expenses related to productivity and commercial initiatives. Operating margin was 3.3% compared to 9.0% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 8.0% compared to 9.9% a year ago.\n\nPet segment adjusted EBITDA was $45 million compared to $58 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Garden Segment Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales for the Garden segment were $234 million compared to $267 million a year ago, a decrease of 12%. The decrease was primarily due to an extra week in the prior year quarter. Organic net sales decreased 11% excluding the impact of the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business.\n\nThe Garden segment’s operating loss was $29 million compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $25 million compared to a loss of $5 million a year ago due to lower volume as well as the impairment of grass seed inventory. Operating margin was (12.3)% compared to (1.3)% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was (10.6)% compared to (2.0)% a year ago.\n\nGarden segment adjusted EBITDA was $(14) million compared to $6 million in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt**\n\nAt September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents was $754 million, compared to $489 million a year ago. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by converting inventory to cash over the last 12 months and lower capital expenditures.\n\nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2024 was $395 million, compared to $382 million in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to changes in working capital driven by the reduction in inventory.\n\nTotal debt at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion. The gross leverage ratio, calculated using the definitions for Indebtedness and EBITDA in Central's credit agreement, at the end of the quarter was 3.1x, in line with the prior year. Central repurchased 270,032 shares or $9 million of its stock during the quarter. Subsequent to the fiscal year end, Central purchased an additional 1,663,479 shares or $52 million of its stock through November 21, 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Adjustments**\n\n**Fiscal 2024**\n\nCentral recognized $45 million in non-GAAP charges in fiscal 2024, $28 million of which related to Cost & Simplicity initiatives.\n\nWithin the Garden segment, this included closure and consolidation of one manufacturing facility, six distribution facilities and one research facility as well as beginning the wind-down of Central's pottery business. Within the Pet segment, this included the announced closure and consolidation of two manufacturing facilities related to a durable pet supply business as well as impairment of intangible assets related to this business due to changing market conditions and increased international competition.\n\nIn addition to Cost & Simplicity related charges, Central recognized $4 million in charges related to the impairment of equity investments in two underperforming private businesses, partially offset by a gain on the settlement of a litigation.\n\nThe $45 million overall charge was mostly noncash, with $16 million included in cost of goods sold, $21 million in selling, general and administrative expense, and $8 million in other expense.\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024**\n\nNon-GAAP charges for the fourth quarter were $29 million, $12 million of which related to Cost & Simplicity initiatives, $13 million related to intangible impairments, and $4 million related to the equity investment write downs and partially offsetting a gain on the settlement of a litigation.\n\nThe $29 million overall charge was mostly noncash, with $5 million included in cost of goods sold, $16 million in selling, general and administrative expense, and $8 million in other expense.\n\n**Outlook for Fiscal 2025**\n\nCentral currently expects fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS to be $2.20 or better. This outlook takes into consideration deflationary pressure in certain commodity businesses, evolving consumer behavior in an environment of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the challenging brick-and-mortar retail environment. Central expects fiscal 2025 capital spending to be in the range of $60-70 million. This outlook excludes the impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or restructuring activities that may occur during fiscal 2025, including projects under the Cost and Simplicity program.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCentral will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time), hosted by Niko Lahanas, CEO, and Brad Smith, CFO, to discuss these results and to provide a general business update.

However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted EBITDA and organic net sales. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance.\n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. While Management believes that non-GAAP measures are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense (or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). Adjusted EBITDA further excludes one-time charges related to facility closures exits of business, intangible and investment impairments and gains from a litigation settlement. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.\n\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below.\n\nWe have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as we cannot do so without unreasonable efforts due to the potential variability and limited visibility of excluded items. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\n\n  * _Facility closures and business exit_ : we have excluded charges related to the closure of distribution and manufacturing facilities and our decision to exit the pottery business as they represent infrequent transactions that impact the comparability between operating periods. We believe these exclusions supplement the GAAP information with a measure that may be useful to investors in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance.\n  * _Asset impairment charges_ : we exclude the impact of asset impairments on intangible assets and investments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency. We believe that the adjustment of these charges supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Gain from litigation settlement_ : we exclude the gain from a litigation settlement as it is a one-time occurrence. We believe that the exclusion of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Gain on sale of a business or service line_ : we exclude the impact of the gain on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Tax impact_ : adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment.\n\n\n\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\n\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\n\n**Facility closures and business exits**\n\n(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $7.5 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of manufacturing facilities in California and Arizona. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to facility closures and business exits announced in fiscal 2023 and earlier in fiscal 2024.\n\n(2) During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $11.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations, from the decision to exit the pottery business, the closure of a live goods distribution facility in Delaware and the relocation of our grass seed research facility.\n\n(3) During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $5.3 million in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing facility in California and the consolidation of our Southeast distribution network.\n\n(4) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a gain of $5.8 million from the sale of our independent garden center distribution business, which includes the impact of associated facility closure costs. The gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n(5) In fiscal 2023, we recognized incremental expense of $13.9 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense of $1.8 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of a second manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas.\n\n**Intangible Impairments**\n\n(6) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $12.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due primarily to changing market conditions resulting from the decline in demand for durable products and increased international competition.\n\n(7) In fiscal 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $2.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets caused by the loss of a significant customer in our live fish business. Also, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due to reduced demand for products we sold under an acquired trade name. The impairments were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative costs.\n\n**Gain from litigation and investment impairment**\n\n(8) Within corporate, the Company received $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 in settlement of litigation which gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Additionally, we recognized a $7.5 million non-cash impairment charge for two related private company investments that is included within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n**Net Income and Diluted Net Income Per Share Reconciliation** |  **GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation**  \n---|---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Fiscal Year Ended**  \n**September 28,

View the full release here:\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241125974807/en/\n\"We have a lot to be proud of this year. We increased non-GAAP EPS, continued margin\nexpansion, made significant progress on our Cost and Simplicity program, and achieved\nstrong profits in our Pet segment and record cash flow for the company. We accomplished\nthis despite continued soft demand across our Pet segment, in particular in durable pet\nproducts, and a difficult garden season,\" said Niko Lahanas, Central Garden & Pet's new\nCEO. \"While we expect the external environment to remain challenging, I am confident we\nhave the right strategy and people in place to deliver profitable growth in fiscal 2025 and for\nthe long term.\"\nFiscal 2024 Results\nNet sales were $3.2 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the prior year, a decrease of 3%.\nFiscal 2023 benefited from an additional week in the fourth quarter.

Pet organic net sales decreased 6%. Net sales for the Garden segment\nwere $1.37 billion compared to $1.43 billion in the prior year, a decrease of 5%. Garden\norganic net sales decreased 1%.\nGross margin expanded by 90 basis points to 29.5% from 28.6% in the prior year. On a non-\nGAAP basis, gross margin expanded by 110 basis points to 30.0% from 28.9% a year ago\ndriven by productivity efforts and moderating inflation.\nOperating income was $185 million compared to $211 million in the prior year, a decrease of\n12%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $223 million compared to $227 million a\nyear ago. Operating margin was 5.8% compared to 6.4% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP\nbasis, operating margin expanded to 7.0% from 6.9% a year ago due to improved gross\nmargin and continued cost discipline in selling, general and administrative expense.\nNet interest expense was $38 million compared to $50 million in the prior year driven by\nhigher interest income.\nOther expense was $5.1 million compared to other income of $1.5 million a year ago due to\nthe impairment of two underperforming equity investments in the fourth quarter.\nNet income was $108 million compared to $126 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP\nbasis, net income increased to $142 million from $138 million a year ago. Earnings per\nshare were $1.62 compared to $1.88 in the prior year.

The\nprior year quarter benefited from an extra week.

On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin contracted by 60 basis\npoints to 26.0% from 26.6% in the prior year.\nOperating loss was $32 million compared to operating income of $9 million a year ago. On a\nnon-GAAP basis, operating loss was $11 million compared to operating income of $12\nmillion reflecting lower volumes, the inventory impairment, and the timing of expenses\nrelated to productivity and commercial initiatives.

Organic net sales decreased 14% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS.\nThe Pet segment’s operating income was $14 million compared to $43 million a year ago.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $35 million compared to $48 million in the prior\nyear due to lower volume and the timing of expenses related to productivity and commercial\ninitiatives. Operating margin was 3.3% compared to 9.0% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP\nbasis, operating margin was 8.0% compared to 9.9% a year ago.\nPet segment adjusted EBITDA was $45 million compared to $58 million in the prior year\nquarter.\nGarden Segment Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results\nNet sales for the Garden segment were $234 million compared to $267 million a year ago, a\ndecrease of 12%. The decrease was primarily due to an extra week in the prior year quarter.\nOrganic net sales decreased 11% excluding the impact of the sale of the independent\ngarden channel distribution business.\nThe Garden segment’s operating loss was $29 million compared to a loss of $3 million in the\nprior year.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by converting\ninventory to cash over the last 12 months and lower capital expenditures.\nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2024 was $395 million, compared to $382 million in\nthe prior year. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to changes in\nworking capital driven by the reduction in inventory.\nTotal debt at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion. The gross\nleverage ratio, calculated using the definitions for Indebtedness and EBITDA in Central's\ncredit agreement, at the end of the quarter was 3.1x, in line with the prior year. Central\nrepurchased 270,032 shares or $9 million of its stock during the quarter. Subsequent to the\nfiscal year end, Central purchased an additional 1,663,479 shares or $52 million of its stock\nthrough November 21, 2024.\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nFiscal 2024\nCentral recognized $45 million in non-GAAP charges in fiscal 2024, $28 million of which\nrelated to Cost & Simplicity initiatives.\nWithin the Garden segment, this included closure and consolidation of one manufacturing\nfacility, six distribution facilities and one research facility as well as beginning the wind-down\nof Central's pottery business. Within the Pet segment, this included the announced closure\nand consolidation of two manufacturing facilities related to a durable pet supply business as\nwell as impairment of intangible assets related to this business due to changing market\nconditions and increased international competition.\nIn addition to Cost & Simplicity related charges, Central recognized $4 million in charges\nrelated to the impairment of equity investments in two underperforming private businesses,\npartially offset by a gain on the settlement of a litigation.\nThe $45 million overall charge was mostly noncash, with $16 million included in cost of\ngoods sold, $21 million in selling, general and administrative expense, and $8 million in other\nexpense.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2024\nNon-GAAP charges for the fourth quarter were $29 million, $12 million of which related to\nCost & Simplicity initiatives, $13 million related to intangible impairments, and $4 million\nrelated to the equity investment write downs and partially offsetting a gain on the settlement\nof a litigation.\nThe $29 million overall charge was mostly noncash, with $5 million included in cost of goods\nsold, $16 million in selling, general and administrative expense, and $8 million in other\nexpense.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2025\nCentral currently expects fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS to be $2.20 or better. This outlook\ntakes into consideration deflationary pressure in certain commodity businesses, evolving\nconsumer behavior in an environment of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, and\nthe challenging brick-and-mortar retail environment. Central expects fiscal 2025 capital\nspending to be in the range of $60-70 million. This outlook excludes the impact of any\nacquisitions, divestitures or restructuring activities that may occur during fiscal 2025,\nincluding projects under the Cost and Simplicity program.\nConference Call\nCentral will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time),\nhosted by Niko Lahanas, CEO, and Brad Smith, CFO, to discuss these results and to\nprovide a general business update.

Management uses these\nnon-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) in\nmaking financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in\ntheir assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful\ncomparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. While\nManagement believes that non-GAAP measures are useful supplemental information, such\nadjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read\nin conjunction with those GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net\ninterest expense and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense\n(or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based\ncompensation expense). Adjusted EBITDA further excludes one-time charges related to\nfacility closures exits of business, intangible and investment impairments and gains from a\nlitigation settlement. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted\nEBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of\nour business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted\nEBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluations. Adjusted EBITDA should\nnot be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from\noperations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We\nbelieve that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other\ninterested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA\nwhen reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently\nand it may not be comparable.\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial\nmeasures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables\nbelow.\nWe have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the\ncorresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as we cannot do so without\nunreasonable efforts due to the potential variability and limited visibility of excluded items.\nFor the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the\nunavailable information.\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nFacility closures and business exit: we have excluded charges related to the closure of\ndistribution and manufacturing facilities and our decision to exit the pottery business as\nthey represent infrequent transactions that impact the comparability between operating\nperiods. We believe these exclusions supplement the GAAP information with a\nmeasure that may be useful to investors in assessing the sustainability of our operating\nperformance.\nAsset impairment charges: we exclude the impact of asset impairments on intangible\nassets and investments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and\nfrequency. We believe that the adjustment of these charges supplements the GAAP\ninformation with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing\noperations.\nGain from litigation settlement: we exclude the gain from a litigation settlement as it is a\none-time occurrence. We believe that the exclusion of this gain supplements the GAAP\ninformation with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing\noperations.\nGain on sale of a business or service line: we exclude the impact of the gain on the\nsale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited\ncircumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe\nthe adjustment of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that\nmay be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\nTax impact: adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-\nGAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-\nGAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a\nGAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a\nmaterially different tax treatment.\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe\nthat doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and\nmanagement.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\nFacility closures and business exits\n(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized incremental expense of\n$7.5 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the\nclosure of manufacturing facilities in California and Arizona. Additionally, we recognized\nincremental expense in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to facility closures\nand business exits announced in fiscal 2023 and earlier in fiscal 2024.\n(2) During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $11.1\nmillion in the consolidated statement of operations, from the decision to exit the pottery\nbusiness, the closure of a live goods distribution facility in Delaware and the relocation\nof our grass seed research facility.\n(3) During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of\n$5.3 million in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a\nmanufacturing facility in California and the consolidation of our Southeast distribution\nnetwork.\n(4) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a gain of $5.8 million from the\nsale of our independent garden center distribution business, which includes the impact\nof associated facility closure costs. The gain is included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\n(5) In fiscal 2023, we recognized incremental expense of $13.9 million in our Pet\nsegment in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a\nmanufacturing and distribution facility in Texas. Additionally, we recognized incremental\nexpense of $1.8 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations,\nfrom the closure of a second manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas.\nIntangible Impairments\n(6) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment\ncharge in our Pet segment of $12.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets\ndue primarily to changing market conditions resulting from the decline in demand for\ndurable products and increased international competition.\n(7) In fiscal 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of\n$2.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets caused by the loss of a\nsignificant customer in our live fish business. Also, we recognized a non-cash\nimpairment charge in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to the impairment of\nintangible assets due to reduced demand for products we sold under an acquired trade\nname. The impairments were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative\ncosts.\nGain from litigation and investment impairment\n(8) Within corporate, the Company received $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2024 in settlement of litigation which gain is included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense. Additionally, we recognized a $7.5 million non-cash impairment\ncharge for two related private company investments that is included within Other income\n(expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\nNet Income and Diluted Net Income Per Share\nReconciliation GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September

However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including\nnon-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted\nEBITDA and organic net sales. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) in making financial, operating and planning decisions\nand in evaluating our performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide\nadditional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. While Management believes thatnon-GAAP measures are useful supplemental information, such\nadjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense (or\noperating income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). Adjusted EBITDA further excludes one-time charges related to facility closures exits of\nbusiness, intangible and investment impairments and gains from a litigation settlement. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in\nevaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such\nevaluations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present\nadjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below.\nWe have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as we cannot do so without unreasonable efforts\ndue to the potential variability and limited visibility of excluded items. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\n• Facility closures and business exit: we have excluded charges related to the closure of distribution and manufacturing facilities and our decision to exit the pottery business as they represent\ninfrequent transactions that impact the comparability between operating periods. We believe these exclusions supplement the GAAP information with a measure that may be useful to\ninvestors in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance.\n• Asset impairment charges: we exclude the impact of asset impairments on intangible assets and investments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency. We believe\nthat the adjustment of these charges supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n• Gain from litigation settlement: we exclude the gain from a litigation settlement as it is a one-time occurrence. We believe that the exclusion of this gain supplements the GAAP information\nwith a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n• Gain on sale of a business or service line: we exclude the impact of the gain on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts\nthe comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the performance of our\nongoing operations.\n• Tax impact: adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is\ncalculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment.\nQ4 and FY24 Investor Presentation 17\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with thegoal of providing useful information to investors and\nmanagement.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\nFacility closures and business exits\n1. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $7.5 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of\nmanufacturing facilities in California and Arizona. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to facility closures and business exits\nannounced in fiscal 2023 and earlier in fiscal 2024.\n2. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $11.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations, from the decision to exit the pottery business, the\nclosure of a live goods distribution facility in Delaware and the relocation of our grass seed research facility.\n3. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $5.3 million in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing facility in\nCalifornia and the consolidation of our Southeast distribution network.\n4. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a gain of $5.8 million from the sale of our independent garden center distribution business, which includes the impact of associated\nfacility closure costs. The gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\n5. In fiscal 2023, we recognized incremental expense of $13.9 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing and distribution\nfacility in Texas. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense of $1.8 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of a second\nmanufacturing and distribution facility in Texas.\nIntangible Impairments\n6. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $12.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due primarily to\nchanging market conditions resulting from the decline in demand for durable products and increased international competition.\n7. In fiscal 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $2.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets caused by the loss of a significant customer in\nour live fish business. Also, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due to reduced demand for\nproducts we sold under an acquired trade name. The impairments were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative costs.\nGain from litigation and investment impairment\n8. Within corporate, the Company received $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 in settlement of litigation which gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense.\nAdditionally, we recognized a $7.5 million non-cash impairment charge for two related private company investments that is included within Other income (expense) in the consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nQ4 and FY24 Investor Presentation 18\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation for the Fiscal Year Ended\n(in thousands, except for per share amounts)\nNet Income &

I'm truly honored to be here Central CEO, leading our talented team as we\nadvance the company and enter an exciting phase of growth. Since becoming CEO, I've had the privilege of working closely with\nour leaders and our Board of Directors, and I'm more confident than ever in our path forward. We are operating from a foundation of\nstrength with a focus on our Central to Home strategy which includes our cost of simplicity initiatives and our plans around customer\nand consumer experience, innovation and operational excellence.\nOur goal is to build on this foundation and to drive long-term value for you, our investors. Having been with Central for over 18 years,\nI bring deep experience and understanding of our business. However, stepping into the CEO role offers me a fresh perspective, and\nI see clear opportunities to sharpen our focus, accelerate our key initiatives and identify areas for future growth. Going forward, I'm\neager to share our vision and provide you with insights into our performance and discuss the steps we're taking to navigate the current\nenvironment while setting the stage for future success.\nBefore we go into the key messages, I want to thank Beth Springer, who did an exceptional job as our interim CEO and continue\nto serve as our Lead Independent Director. Let me start with the 3 key themes I'd like you to take away from this call. First, we had\nnotable achievements in fiscal '24. Despite challenges, we delivered solid results in a tough environment. Next, we made meaningful\nprogress on our cost and simplicity program. We're streamlining our operations and positioning ourselves for long-term success. And\nthird, looking ahead to fiscal '25.\nWhile we expect the consumer and competitive landscape to remain difficult, we're focused on executing our strategy and driving\nsustainable growth. Now let me delve into each of these themes in more detail. Turning first to our fiscal '24 achievements. We're\nincredibly proud of what team Central accomplished over the past 12 months. Despite facing a difficult environment, including soft\ndemand across our pet businesses, particularly durable pet products and a tough garden season, we delivered the following: growth\nin non-GAAP EPS, continued gross margin expansion, strong profits in our Pet segment and another record year of operating cash\nflow. These achievements showcase the grit and perseverance of our 6,450 employees who rolled up their sleeves and work together\nto drive results and serve our customers.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nThank you to the entire Central team for your dedication and resilience. Second, progress on our Cost and Simplicity program. Our\nCost and Simplicity program is a multiyear journey to simplify operations, enhance efficiency and better leverage the scale of our\nbusiness across procurement, manufacturing, logistics portfolio optimization and administrative costs. Let me highlight some of\nthe initiatives from the fourth quarter. Starting first with our consolidation of operations. We further integrated our Arden outdoor\ncushion, dog bed and K&H businesses, closing 2 leased facilities in Arizona and California and shifting production to our own\nfacilities in North Carolina and Indiana has improved e-commerce capabilities reduced shipping costs and provided room for growth.\nSecond, scaling our natural dog treats production. To meet growing consumer demand, we expanded capacity and enhanced efficiency\nat our natural dog treats processing plant in Mexico, allowing us to capture a larger market share. Third, optimizing transportation.\nWe completed the rollout of a corporate transportation management system and centralized load planning across most business units,\nreducing costs and improving delivery reliability.\nAnd finally, streamlining our live plant operations. We consolidated our 2 live plants businesses under the Bell brand name, closed\nolder, less profitable facilities and moved production to a modernized site in Kentucky for better planning and output. These initiatives\nare part of our broader effort to make Central more lean, more agile and efficient. They are designed to drive margin expansion\nand free up resources for organic growth and strategic M&A as well as to enhance our social responsibility and environmental\nstewardship. As such, we are embedding sustainability into our operations with measurable goals outlined in our latest impact report\nto ensure a resilient and secure supply chain, reduce our environmental impact and provide a safe working environment for our\nemployees.\nRecent efforts also include participation in and Home Depot's Foundation community events, reflecting our commitment to giving\nback to those in need. Now let's move to our third key message around our outlook for fiscal '25. Looking ahead, we remain steadfast\nin our commitment to the Central to Home strategy. Here's how we're preparing for the year ahead, staying disciplined on our cost\nand cash agenda, making targeted investments in critical capabilities, particularly in e-commerce, digital and innovation. Maintaining\na focused approach to identifying and pursuing strategic M&A opportunities that align with our growth priorities, enhance our\ncapabilities and strengthen our portfolio, and advancing a pipeline of new products across our pet and garden portfolios with launches\nplanned for fiscal '25 and beyond.\nThat said, we anticipate having to navigate a challenging external environment marked by macroeconomic and geopolitical\nuncertainties. We foresee continued pressure on consumers who will prioritize value and be strongly influenced by discounts and\npromotional offers. An increasingly competitive and promotion-driven marketplace and significant headwinds in the brick-and-mortar\nretail sector presenting unique challenges.\nFurthermore, extreme weather seems to have become the new normal. Adding an even greater volatility to an already seasonal garden\nbusiness. That said, we remain confident in our strategy, our team and the decisive actions we are taking to drive profitable growth\nin fiscal 2025 and beyond. In line with this, we are guiding fiscal '25 to non-GAAP EPS to be $2.20 or higher. With that, let me\nbriefly summarize my remarks before turning it over to Brad. I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished in a challenging year. We\ndelivered growth in non-GAAP EPS, demonstrating our financial resilience. We successfully expanded our gross margin despite softer\ncategory consumption and sales, and we achieved a record-breaking cash flow year, solidifying our fortress balance sheet. But what\nexcites me most was that these achievements were driven by our exceptional people and their unwavering ability to execute even in a\ncontinually changing and tough environment.\nAnd with that, I'd like to introduce to you Brad Smith, Central's new CFO. For those of you who haven't met Brad yet, he joined\nCentral in 2017 as Chief Financial Officer of our Pet segment. Prior to Central Brad worked 12 years at what is now Ahold Delhaize.\nBrad, the floor is yours.\nBrad Smith\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, Niko, and hello, everyone. It's great to be here with you all today. Building on Niko's remarks, let me start with our\nfiscal '24 results. Net sales were $3.2 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. As a reminder, fiscal '23 benefited from\nan extra week in the fourth quarter. Organic net sales declined 4%, excluding the impact of the TDBBS acquisition and the sale\nof our independent garden channel distribution business. Non-GAAP gross profit for the year was $960 million compared to $957\nmillion and non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 110 basis points to 30% and driven by productivity efforts throughout the year and\nmoderating inflation.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nNon-GAAP SG&A of $737 million was 1% above the prior year and non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis\npoints to 23%, reflecting the addition of TDBBS, partially offset by cost discipline across our business in response to lower volumes.\nNon-GAAP adjustments were $45 million in fiscal '24. Of that total, $28 million related to Cost and Simplicity initiatives.\nWithin Garden, this included closure and consolidation of 1 manufacturing facility 6 distribution facilities and 1 research facility, all\nof which will be completed by the end of this calendar year as well as the wind down of our pottery business, which will be completed\nby the end of calendar '25. Within Pet, this included closure and consolidation of 2 Arden and K&H manufacturing facilities, which\nwere announced in the fourth quarter and will be completed in the second half of fiscal '25.\nIn addition to the Cost and Simplicity charges, the fourth quarter also includes the impairment of intangible assets related to K&H\ndue to changing market conditions and increased international competition. Lastly, we recognized $4 million in net charges related to\nthe impairment of equity investments in 2 private businesses, partially offset by gain on the settlement of litigation. The $45 million\noverall charge was mostly noncash, with $16 million included in COGS, cost of goods, $21 million in SG&A and $8 million in other\nexpense. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $223 million compared to $227 million a year ago, and non-GAAP operating\nmargin expanded to 7% from 6.9%.\nBelow the line, interest expense -- net interest expense was $38 million compared to $50 million driven by higher interest income.\nNon-GAAP other income was $2.4 million compared to $1.5 million. Non-GAAP net income was $142 million compared to $138\nmillion and non-GAAP EPS came in at $2.13 above our guidance and above prior year. GAAP EPS was $1.62. Adjusted EBITDA for\nthe year was $334 million compared to $343 million. Our tax rate for the year increased by 80 basis points to 23.2%, primarily due to\nan increase in the blended state income tax rate.\nNow turning to the consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net sales were $669 million, down 11%\nversus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lapping the extra week last year. Organic net sales decreased 13%, excluding\nthe acquisition of TDBBS and the sale of the Garden distribution business. Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $174 million\ncompared to $199 million and non-GAAP gross margin contracted 60 basis points to 26%, primarily driven by impairment of grass\nseed inventory in our Garden segment, in line with what we signaled in our Q3 call. This charge more than offset benefits we had from\nmoderating inflation and productivity efforts.\nNon-GAAP SG&A for the quarter was $186 million, a 1% decrease and as a percentage of net sales was 27.7% compared to 25%.\nThese variances reflect lower volumes and timing of spend related to productivity and commercial initiatives, Non-GAAP adjustments\nfor the quarter were $29 million, reflecting $10 million related to cost and simplicity initiatives, $13 million related to intangible\nimpairments and $4 million related to the equity investment write-down and partially offsetting legal settlement gain. The $29 million\noverall charge was mostly noncash, with $5 million included in cost of goods, $16 million in SG&A and $8 million in other expense.\nNon-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $11 million compared to operating income of $12 million, non-GAAP operating margin\ncontracted to negative 1.7%. Net interest expense was $6 million compared to $8 million, non-GAAP loss for the quarter was $12\nmillion compared to non-GAAP income of $5 million last year.\nAnd non-GAAP loss per share was $0.18 compared to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.08 last year, adjusted for the stock\ndividend earlier this year. GAAP loss per share was $0.51. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $17 million compared to $42\nmillion. Now I'll provide some insights into the fourth quarter of our 2 segments, starting with Pet. Pet net sales decreased 10% to\n$435 million. Organic net sales decreased 14%, excluding the impact of TDBBS. The decrease was primarily due to lapping an extra\nweek. While durables continue to be soft from a shipment and POS standpoint, consumables POS remain positive and outpaced\nshipments for the quarter.\nOverall, we held market share with gains in e-commerce offsetting slight declines in brick-and-mortar. E-commerce as a percentage of\ntotal pet sales reached a record high of 29%, up 4 points over prior year as we continue to improve conversion rates, and drive share\ngrowth online. Sales of our branded pet products outperformed our private label sales. Our brands continue to demonstrate resilience\nwith share gains in rawhide, both organic and with the addition of TDBBS. And in dog treats and bird. This more than offset private\nlabel declines linked primarily to durable products where demand is soft, and where we have been purposefully rationalizing and in\nsome cases, exiting low-profit SKUs. Non-GAAP operating income for Pet was $35 million versus $48 million a year ago, due to\nlower volume and timing of spend related to our productivity and commercial initiatives. Non-GAAP operating margin was 8% versus\n9.9% a year ago.\nPet segment adjusted EBITDA was $45 million compared to $58 million a year ago. Moving to Garden. In the fourth quarter, Garden\nnet sales were $234 million, down 12% versus a year ago. Organic net sales decreased 11%, excluding the sale of the distribution\nbusiness, similar to Pet, the decline was primarily due to lapping the extra week. Importantly, after a challenging third quarter, we saw\npositive POS trends return in the fourth quarter, and split traffic improved in home centers returning to a level above prior year.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Non-GAAP operating\nloss for Garden was $25 million versus a $5 million loss due to the impairment of grass seed inventory. Non-GAAP operating margin\nwas negative 10.6% compared to negative 2%, Garden segment adjusted EBITDA was a negative $14 million compared to a positive\n$6 million in the prior year. Let me now address the balance sheet and cash flows. Thanks to our focus on turning inventories into\ncash. We had a record cash flow year.\nCash provided by operations was at an all-time high of $395 million in fiscal '24, versus $382 million in the prior year. Compared to\nlast year, our inventory at year-end, even with the acquisition of TDBBS was down 10%. CapEx for the year was $43 million, about\n20% less than what we invested in the prior year. Depreciation and amortization was $91 million compared to $88 million. During the\nfourth quarter of fiscal '24, we bought back approximately 270,000 shares for roughly $9 million. Subsequent to fiscal year-end, we\npurchased approximately 1.7 million additional shares for roughly $52 million through November 21.\nTotal debt was $1.2 billion, in line with the prior year. We ended the quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 3.1%, also in line with\nthe prior year and within our target range of 3 to 3.5x. We had no borrowings under our $750 million credit facility at the end of the\nyear. Cash and equivalents, including short-term investments, were $754 million at year-end compared to $489 million in the prior\nyear. Coupled with our credit facility, this provides us with ample liquidity for M&A. And given our financial strength, we continue\nto be on the lookout for high-growth consumables companies with accretive margins to build scale in core categories, inter-adjacent\ncategories and add key capabilities.\nNow turning to our fiscal '25 outlook. As Niko mentioned, we are guiding fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS to be $2.20 or better. This\ncarefully balances the confidence we have in our strategy and our people against the headwinds we see in front of us this year\naround macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, consumer and customer pressures and volatile weather conditions. As we\nlook to CapEx, we're planning to invest approximately $60 million to $70 million, most of which is either needed for maintenance\nor productivity initiatives across both our segments. We expect Q1 non-GAAP loss per share to be a loss of $0.05 or better for the\nquarter. I want to remind you that Q1 is typically one of our smallest quarters and not indicative of the full year. It is even more the\ncase this year, given we have 2 less shipping days at quarter end compared to last year. As always, our outlook for Q1 and the fiscal\nyear excludes any impact from acquisitions, divestitures or restructuring activities that may occur during fiscal '25. This includes\nprojects under the Cost and Simplicity program.\nAnd with that, we'd like to open the line for all your questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill Chappell, Truist Securities.\nWilliam Bates Chappell\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\nNiko, Brad, congratulations, Niko long, long overdue. But glad that you're in the seat. I guess 2 questions. One, a year ago, we talked\nabout Pet was going to have a tough year. And just -- it was kind of the hangover for from the pandemic? And you thought it would\nkind of ease as we get to the back half and things would normalize as we moved into '25. So what's of the state today? Are we feeling\nlike hangover is going to last a little bit longer? Do we feel like we've bottomed out and Pet, in particular, is going to start to grow\nagain organically as a category or as multiple categories?\nJohn Edward Hanson\nPresident of Pet Consumer Products\nBill, this is John. What we told you for '24 largely came true, consumables outperformed durables, but durables continue to have a\ndouble-digit decline. Even in Q4, the category was down double digits. I think teens right low double digits. And we actually were\ndown a little bit more than that because we have been continuing to skew at low-margin unprofitable SKUs. If you look at Q4, our\nconsumable business was up on POS, right? We think that is more indicative of how we view the business going forward. But the\ncategory still is getting pulled down by durables. The other thing, and we mentioned this in the last quarter a bit. On the durable side,\nconsumers are buying product directly out of Asia.\nAnd there's e-commerce businesses like a Temu, as an example, that get around the de minimis tariff. And we're -- we don't have\nvisibility into what that data looks like. But it's something we're staying on top of and we're managing appropriately going forward.\nBut as we look at the category, next year, we see consumables growing low to mid-single digits, and we see our durable business in\nthe durable category, continuing to decline roughly mid-single digits, I'd call it. Does that help?\nWilliam Bates Chappell\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\nThat helps. Can you remind us the percentage of sales is durables versus consumable?\nJohn Edward Hanson\nPresident of Pet Consumer Products\nYes. For the category, it's roughly 75%, 25%. For us, we're over 80% consumable.\nWilliam Bates Chappell\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\nGot it. Second question, just as we look into '25, are you assuming or are you planning on price increases for both Pet and Garden?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nBill, pricing next year will be very, very tough. In our plan, we're actually net negative on price because it's going to be very much\n-- everyone knows that the commodities have moderated. So pricing will be very difficult to come by. That's going to be one of the\nheadwinds going into the year. It makes our Cost and Simplicity program that much more important so that we can maintain margin as\nopposed to just taking it on the chin on the top line. So pricing will be really hard to come by, I think, in both segments given what's\ngoing on out there in terms of the commodities as well as the consumer being very value-driven right now as well.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brad Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBradley Bingham Thomas\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nNiko and Brad, congratulations. I wanted to start off asking about the Garden segment and J.D. I was hoping you could give us an\nupdate on how some of the conversations are going as you think about the spring sell-in and the amount of shelf space that you're\ngoing to have particularly -- and particularly how you're thinking about the live goods opportunity after such a poor spring that we had\nlast year for the industry?\nJohn D. Walker\nPresident of Garden Consumer Products\nBrad, thanks for the question. I think we feel cautiously optimistic when we look forward to the spring. We are now in negotiations\nwith our customers for a lot of the promotional support. We already know our listings for next year. And I'd say from a branded\nstandpoint, we're in very good shape heading into the year. The customers are signaling that they will load the stores early. As Niko\nmentioned, in the script, we have a couple of shipping days less at the end of the quarter.\nSo at the end of Q1, we shipped an awful lot of the initial shipments for store sets at the beginning of the season. So if it doesn't ship\nat the end of December, it will trickle into January. But they are signaling that they're going to take an aggressive approach to loading\nthe stores and getting ready for the season. With regard to live goods, I'd say we're also cautiously optimistic. I think we've taken some\nkey steps here to, one, take cost out of our own internal network.\nAnd secondly, take some steps to limit the downside risk to that category for us. Now we had an awful Q3 in live goods last year, and\nit was mainly weather driven. So weather can still have a negative impact on us next year. It's hard to imagine the weather would be\nworse than it was this past year when it rains 6 of the 8 weekends that were key to our season. And we came out of that in Q3 and\nwent into the hottest summer on record. So having said that, we're seeing some very encouraging signs with regard to consumption in\nthe live goods category. Going into our Q4 and into Q1 of our fiscal year '25. So I'd say the word here is cautiously optimistic for both\nthe live goods and across the entire Garden segment.\nBradley Bingham Thomas\nKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\nThat's really helpful, J.D. And Niko, maybe if I could ask you a question just around both tariffs and acquisition, maybe I bucket is,\nas you think about the current administration that's coming in here and some of their policies. I guess from one on the tariff front,\ncan you remind us your exposure to China? And if there's anything unusual about the playbook that you would run with tariffs and\nthen just, again, as we think about this administration and the backdrop, does that change at all, do you think the opportunity for\nacquisitions on the horizon?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nSure. So tariffs for one of sort of the keys that we looked at as we put together our plans for '25. And we're looking at potentially 60%\ncoming in from China and then 20% coming in from other regions. So it will have an impact if all of those things happen, hard to tell\nright now, whether it's a lot of saber rattling or what's going to play out an update on our exposure to tariffs, specifically China. I know\nin the past, we've talked about 8% of our cost of goods. With the decrease, so the silver lining with the decrease in durables that we're\nbelow 5% now coming in from China. So much less exposure. And again, if there was a silver lining, that's pretty much it.\nAs far as part 2 of your question, I think it's a really important one because if you look at where we are and how we're strategically\npositioned for the future, we really operate in 2 great categories, but with the elections behind us, we're really entering a new phase,\none that could bring reduced regulatory pressures, increased M&A activity and heightened deal opportunities in '25.\nSo how are we preparing to leverage these favorable conditions, we're really -- we're ready not only to navigate these changes but also\npoised to capitalize on them, given our exceptional liquidity position on our balance sheet. So it's the best insurance policy that I can\nthink of, we can think of ensuring that we stay ahead in an evolving landscape.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Jim Chartier, Monness, Crespi, Hardt.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nCongratulations to Niko and Brad as well. It sounds like the Pet business is going to be up a little bit next year. Just kind of help us\nunderstand kind of the overall sales guidance for the company in the Garden business in particular?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes. We typically don't guide on the top line. But overall, I would say that we're pretty cautious going into the year. it's not going to be\na year of exceptional growth. I think that any growth we get, we're really going to have to fight for. And so I think that's going to be --\nit's going to be a real challenge. And -- the other thing I would add too is we also walked away from some business on the Pet side. So\nthere's some low-margin durable business that really didn't meet our margin standards, if you will, for the company as we're very, very\nmargin focused right now. So we ended up walking away from some low-margin business, which creates a little bit of a hole that we\nhave to dig our way out of, but we think that we've got a good shot at that.\nJohn Edward Hanson\nPresident of Pet Consumer Products\nAnd just on that a little bit, on the durable side, I said our expectation that it will be declining as a category kind of mid-single digits.\nWe're going to lose share in durables next year. We'll be down more because of the SKU rationalization.\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nWell, and the other thing, too, is what's really the big catalyst on the pet side is household penetration. And so we saw a bit of a\npullback after we saw this incredible growth rate during the pandemic where everyone is buying a puppy. And we've seen a bit of a\npullback in terms of the penetration. The good news is we've got a much younger cohort in the category in terms of millennials and\nGen Zs, but the older generation whose pets are passing are not re-upping. And so they're engaging in more travel and experiential\nthings as opposed to going back and buying another dog. So until that starts to turn around, we're sort of stuck in the category being\na bit -- and I'm talking mainly dog here. Cat has actually done better. We're a bit stuck because as everybody knows, it's the durables\nthat follow the the live animal sales. And in our world, we view the live animal sales at durables as well. And that's really dock, which\nsort of drives the bus here. Cat has done better. We feel that's -- one of the reasons for that is the return to office and cats tend to be a\nlittle bit more independent and folks have continued to purchase cats. So that area has done better.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then I think last quarter, you said the grass seed write-down would be, I don't know, $15 million to $20 million. Just where\nexactly did that come in?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nCame in that range. Unfortunately, we were pretty accurate.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nAnd where is the $20 million or?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nNo, it was on the high end of the range. It was $19 million.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then you mentioned tough to take pricing next year. What does your cost outlook look like for next year before the benefit\nof your cost simplicity initiative?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nI mean our cost outlook is good. We've done a great job over the years taking cost out. We're going to continue to do that. We're\nbecoming better at manufacturing. The real question will be what does the promotional environment look like in the marketplace? Are\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nwe going to have to promote more discount more. Those things still have to play out. But I will tell you that we're doing everything we\ncan on our end to become a more efficient, better organization.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Bob Labick, CJS Securities.\nRobert James Labick\nCJS Securities, Inc.\nWe'd like to offer our congratulations to Niko and Brad as well. I guess we talked a little bit about revenue headwinds so far. You've\nsaid pricing, walking from some lower-margin business, the consumer, et cetera. I was hoping you could kind of give us a sense of\nany other revenue headwinds going here? And then certainly, any tailwinds you see that we should be thinking about for fiscal '25?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes. I mean, we also had -- we lost a little bit of business on the Garden side in our vendor partner area. It's not going to be the highest\nmargin business but it does create a little bit of a gap on the top line. I would say tailwinds sort of what I outlined. We are taking\na very consumer-centric approach delivering exceptional value to customers and consumers through tailored promotions. We're\ngoing to innovate and also up our game digitally. So those are areas that we think we can grow. And then underpinning all of that is\nour continued efforts around cost and simplicity, optimizing the supply chain, inventory management, these are all going to help us\nmitigate impact on tariffs and weather-related disruptions.\nSo just becoming a better, more efficient organization. And again, investing in e-commerce because we think that can offset some\nof the challenges that we're seeing in brick-and-mortar right now. and then really adapting to changing consumer behavior. So really\nbecoming a more agile organization.\nRobert James Labick\nCJS Securities, Inc.\nOkay. Great. And then as it relates to Cost and Simplicity, how would you characterize how much you've accomplished to date and\nwhat remains as opportunities ahead in terms of -- I don't know how much you'll quantify this, the impact you could have on fiscal '25,\nthe benefits and then future benefits over the next several years?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes. Again, we're staying away from quantifying it, giving a big cost envelope and then giving a timetable to hit those numbers\nbecause invariably, we'd be wrong about all of that. What I would tell you is we've made a tremendous amount of progress. We closed\n11 facilities in '24, and we're really consolidating facilities and taking cost out we're consolidating businesses. If you look at what we\ndid on the pet side with pet bedding, our cushion business and K&H. So, you're seeing us form these platforms around efficiency and\nreally aligning for scale. We have a ways to go. We're going to be doing more of it in '25 and into the future. And I think also when\nyou look at a company like ours where we really grow through acquisition and we have a big M&A agenda that the work is never\nreally done. So you're continuously looking to integrate, take costs out, become more efficient and the bigger and better our platforms\nare, the more synergies we can bring to the table when we do acquisitions.\nSo we feel like it really sets us up and makes us an even better acquirer going forward once we engage in M&A.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brian McNamara, Canaccord Genuity.\nBrian Christopher McNamara\nCanaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division\nOf course, our congratulations to Niko and Brad on the promotions. A couple of months ago, a CFO at one of your Pet specialty\nretail customers offered an expectation that the Pet industry should return to mid-single-digit growth in the \"not-too-distant future.\"\nI'm curious what your take is there and what's kind of required to get the category growing again. Are pets just too expensive in the\ncurrent macro environment?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nCEO & Director\nOh, God, that's a lot, I think I would go back to what I stated earlier, which is it really starts with the live animal. And until we get\nfolks out there buying more live animals, we're going to see sort of the pet category kind of flatlined. I think you're seeing a lot of\nother things that work here. There's a lot of premiumization going on, particularly in food and treats. But to get to real unit growth,\nwe need to improve the household penetration of the Pets themselves. So in our view, that's really the rate limiting factor. In some\ncategories, we're below pre-pandemic levels right now.\nBrian Christopher McNamara\nCanaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division\nThat's helpful. And maybe 1 for J.D. Obviously, our last 3 years of weather haven't clearly helped the Garden business. Can you\nremind us what is ideal weather for your important Garden product lines as you and your public competitors have very exposures. And\nare there any efforts being made to kind of diversify or mitigate this weather risk?\nJohn D. Walker\nPresident of Garden Consumer Products\nYes, great question. I think if you look at our portfolio, we actually do have 1 business that is a little bit counter seasonal to the typical\nlawn and garden business, and that is our wild bird feed business. So winter months, winter storms, things like that, we tend to see a\nspike in our business, and it's a nice offset to the rest of our traditional lawn and Garden portfolio. But ideally, we'd like to see, unlike\nthe harsh summers that we've seen in the last couple of years and late-breaking spring. We'd like to see warm temperatures, moderate\ntemperatures with precipitation. Ideally, I tell people, ideally, it would be great if it would rain on Wednesdays and every weekend\nwas sunny and beautiful. So that would be ideal for weather. We just haven't seen that in a few years.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Shovana Chowdhury, JPMorgan.\nShovana Nafiz Chowdhury\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nCongrats to both Niko and Brad, I wanted to ask 2 questions, if I may. You spoke about how e-commerce has been growing for both\nthe segments, and it has more or less offset or partially after some of the pressures you may be seeing in brick and mortar. And so you\nsaid you may be upping your game digitally next year to help with the top line growth. Can you give -- can you like elaborate more\non what are some of the steps you're taking and also, if I may, I'd like to ask about consumers who are attracted to more promotions,\nunderstandably, given the current metro environment and called out the cheap Asian e-commerce such as Temu. Can you give us\nmore color on this and the level of promotions you're seeing versus prepandemic levels? And also a sense of how your market share is\nimpacted as a result?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nSure, I'll start with the e-comm question. We we've made a lot of really great progress in e-com. We've hired some tremendously\ntalented people. If you look at -- we have to have an orientation that looks at the business from an omnichannel standpoint. And a lot\nof customers, they want that. That's what they're doing. So it's really kind of a symbiotic relationship between online and off-line. It's\ngoing to all oversimplify it, but it really just starts with content is the first step and really having an A+ content for your A SKUs and\ngetting that out there. And then the other part is really inventory management, making sure that the product is available to ship. So it\nmay sound a little bit oversimplistic, but it really starts with blocking and tackling.\nThen there's other things we can do in terms of search engine optimization, improving conversion rates, we have an extensive program\nwhere we go out. We test things if they fail, we fail fast and then take a different angle in terms of trying to drive the customer to\nthe site and really increase that conversion rate and the return on on those ad spends. And we constantly monitor that. And I think\nthere's been a lot of progress there. The other part too is having your own fulfillment capabilities, and that's something that we are\ndistributing across the company.\nBack in '21, we bought DMO. They had an incredible fulfillment capability, where we're taking their software and their business\nprocess and really distributing it across the country. So that we're in a position where we have that flexibility to either ship to an e-\ncomm, e-tailer or do a 3P situation where we are fulfilling it ourselves in the most efficient way possible. So it's it's digital from a\nmarketing standpoint, it's also very much having logistical capabilities as well.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nJohn Edward Hanson\nPresident of Pet Consumer Products\nYes. And the only thing I'd add on the Pet side, Niko mentioned, we built a ton of capability here and that's people, that systems,\nthat's processes it's the DMO capability that Niko mentioned. This year, 29% of our business was e-comm, that's up 4 points, we've\ngrown share year-on-year, I think, for 3 or 4 years in e-comm. So we've got a good playbook and we want to continue to enhance that\nplaybook. Some of it is having the right pack sizes as well to hit the key price points that we need. But the fulfillment piece is going\nto be really important as we go forward, and that's going to be help as an enabler to continue that growth and continue to lean into that\nchannel.\nShovana Nafiz Chowdhury\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nAnd the other question was on the promotional level you're seeing versus pre-pandemic levels and what you do and how has your\nmarket share being impacted if it has?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nWell, I mean, it's J.D., you want to take it?\nJohn D. Walker\nPresident of Garden Consumer Products\nWell, I was just going to speak for Garden. The planning of the promotional calendar is not -- they're only a few months out, so they\nare not beyond early spring at this point in time. We're anticipating a much more promotional marketplace this coming year, but we\ndon't know a lot of the details yet. So we are in the bidding process to land some of those promotions, and we'll bid aggressively, but\nwe expect it to be a very competitive marketplace.\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes. I just think overall growth, again, I said it earlier, is going to be harder to come by because of the deflationary environment that\nwe're in. And so it's going to become very, very competitive, we think, in '25 from a promotional standpoint.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from William Reuter, Bank of America. Correction. That is Carla Casella, JPMorgan.\nCarla Marie Casella Hodulik\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nCan you hear me?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes, barely.\nCarla Marie Casella Hodulik\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nAll right. I'm having problem with my connection. Can you hear me?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nThat's better.\nCarla Marie Casella Hodulik\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nOkay. Sorry about that. A couple of questions here. One, you talked about the M&A environment taking -- changing for 2025 and\ntotally agree with you there. Can you give us some guidepost of how high you'd be comfortable taking leverage or kind of where your\ncomfort zone on is in terms of leverage if you find the right transaction or transactions?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes. We'd be willing to go over 4x leverage. We need to have a direct line of sight to get it back to our 3, 3.5, but we'd be willing to\nlean into something over 4.\nCarla Marie Casella Hodulik\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. Great. And then on the tariff front, looking back at '18, '19, what were the best mitigant or the -- how could you mitigate the\ntariffs? And does this change as you look at the potential this go around?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nI think it does to some extent because I don't believe the tariffs were -- let's just talk to China for a second. I don't think they were 60%\nlast time. They were a little bit lower -- there are several ways you can look at it. We looked at in-sourcing. We'll look at sourcing\nfrom different countries that either have no tariff or a much lower tariff and then if we can't move the product, then we work with\nthose vendors on taking cost out and just getting it to a point where you can be competitive. Those are really kind of the 3 options.\nThose are the things we did last time and I think we'll be doing it again if we're putting that position. Fortunately, our exposure is\nlower, though. So that plays a pretty big role for us.\nCarla Marie Casella Hodulik\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nGreat. And then just one more on the cost simplification program. How much are you outsource versus in-source today? And where\nare you in that process? How many -- what inning are you in, in terms of further opportunities there?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nGood question. I would probably put a maybe midway kind of fourth, fifth inning right now. We made a lot of progress this last year.\nI think '25 is going to be another pretty big year for us as well. But really, things are progressing quite nicely. Like I said, we took out\n11 facilities in '24. And with minimal to no business disruption. So I'll just take a quick opportunity to call out the teams that have\ndone that work. I just amazing that there was no business disruption there really performing with excellence. So we're getting quite\ngood at it.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from William Reuter, Bank of America.\nWilliam Michael Reuter\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nSo you clearly have a ton of cash on the balance sheet you mentioned that your outlook is still that the Pet industry is going to be\ndown. I think you said mid-single digits this year. Are valuations in for acquisitions coming down commensurate for the outlook,\nwhich is more subdued than I think most industry participants expected 12 or 18 months ago?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nOn the Pet side, we haven't seen much. We've seen a lot of durable businesses out there, but not a whole lot of consumables. I know\nthe expectation is still pretty high on the Pet side in terms of multiples. But all my great ranking relationships assure me that there's\ngoing to be immense deal flow in '25. So we'll have lots to choose from. So I'm being a little cheeky, but the election being over I\nthink that there is a lot of optimism going into '25 that deal flow will pick up in the midst of a more favorable regulatory environment\nand really just a lot of pent-up demand. If you look at the level of transactions, IPOs, you name it, has been fairly anemic the last year\nor 2. So we believe that there's a lot of pent-up demand, both from a supply and demand standpoint.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 25, 2024\nSo we're looking forward seeing more deals. And frankly, I can't think of being better positioned than we are right now to take\nadvantage of that.\nWilliam Michael Reuter\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nOkay. And then just one follow-up. In terms of M&A targets, you mentioned consumables and you mentioned Pet, would you\nconsider targets that are either on the durable side and Pet? Or would you consider additional M&A in the Garden side of the\nbusiness? That's it.\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nDepends on the deal. I think the durable side is, believe it or not, a little harder for us to wrap our heads around right now given what's\ngoing on. But if an attractive deal came across in Garden that we think had legs, we would look at it. I think it's going to be very deal\nspecific and where we see value. So I'll never say no. But I think the durable is a longer put, the durable piece.\nBrad Smith\nChief Financial Officer\nThis is Brad. One thing I would add is strategically, I think we want to avoid any further exposure to seasonality in our business. So\nthat's a key driver as well in what we look at.\nOperator\nAnd our last question comes from Hale Holden, Barclays.\nMary Ann Neale\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nThis is Mary Ann Neale on for Hale. Just on the back of Carla and Bill's questions. Could you speak a little bit to what inning you\nmight be in your M&A pipeline in terms of pursuing a transaction, please?\nNicholas Lahanas\nCEO & Director\nYes. We -- M&A is really an uncertain business. So we're a little reluctant to to give color in terms of what inning we're in. What I can\ntell you is things have picked up a little bit. We're in a few processes right now. but that's pretty much all I can share because there's\nno guarantee we win those or what the outcome is there. There's a lot of uncertainty in those as everybody knows. So -- just know that\nthings have picked up a little bit, and we are out there looking at stuff.\nOperator\nAnd with there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to Friederike Edelmann for closing remarks.\nFriederike Edelmann\nVice President of Investor Relations\nThank you for attending our earnings call today and have a wonderful Thanksgiving. If you have further questions, please reach out to\nme and other wise. Enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator\nThank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this\ntime.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Business\nOur Company\nCentral Garden & Pet Company (“Central”) is a market leader in the pet and garden industries in the United States. For over 40 years, Central has marketed innovative and trusted solutions helping lawns grow\ngreener, gardens bloom bigger, pets live healthier, and communities grow stronger. We manage our operations through two reportable segments: Pet and Garden.\nOur Pet segment includes dog and cat supplies such as treats and chews, toys, beds and containment, grooming products, waste management and training pads; supplies for aquatics, small animals, reptiles\nand pet birds including toys, enclosures and habitats, bedding, food and supplements; products for equine and livestock, animal and household health and insect control products; live fish and small animals as well\nas outdoor cushions. These products are sold under brands such as Aqueon®, Cadet®, C&S®, Comfort Zone®, Farnam®, Four Paws®, Kaytee®, Nylabone® and Zilla®.\nOur Garden segment includes lawn and garden consumables such as grass seed; vegetable, flower and herb packet seed; wild bird feed, bird houses and other birding accessories; weed, grass, and other\nherbicides, insecticide and pesticide products; fertilizers and live plants. These products are sold under brands such as Amdro®, Ferry-Morse®, Pennington® and Sevin®.\nThe following charts indicate each class of similar products that represented approximately 10% or more of our consolidated net sales and the percentage of net sales represented by each segment in fiscal\n2024.\nStrategy\nOur Central to Home strategy reinforces our unique purpose to nurture happy and healthy homes and our ambition to lead the future of the pet and garden industries. Our objective is to grow net sales,\noperating income and cash flows by developing new products, increasing market share, acquiring businesses and working in partnership with our customers to grow the categories in which we participate. We run\nour business with a long-term perspective, and we believe the successful delivery of our strategy will enable us to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. To achieve our objective, we plan to capitalize on\nour competitive strengths and favorable industry trends by executing on five key strategic pillars to drive long-term growth.\nConsumer: Build and Grow Brands that Consumers Love\nTo grow, we are seeking to develop more differentiated new products and reinvest some of our annual cost savings in brand building and demand creation to help us drive sustainable organic growth and build\nmarket share. We continuously strive to get a deeper understanding of our consumers, the products and features they desire and how they make their purchasing decisions. We are investing in consumer insights,\ndata analytics as well as research and development to achieve our innovation goals with a strong pipeline of new products. We recognize that consumers are increasingly researching, as well as buying products\nonline and we continue to advance our digital capabilities. We have seen promising marketing campaign results driving accelerated growth and share gains across several brands, including our Farnam “Everything\nfor the Ride” and Zilla “Rep Yourself” campaigns.\n1\nCustomer: Win with Winning Customers and Channels\nWe are building on our strong customer relationships by developing and executing winning category growth strategies. We produce both branded and private label products for our customers as well as\ndistribute third-party brands that give our retail partners a breadth of selection from premium to value products. Recent trends have shown that eCommerce channels, including pure-play, omnichannel and direct-to-\nconsumer, are the preferred solutions for today's convenience-oriented consumers. To address the changing consumer landscape, we continue to build out our digital and eCommerce capabilities while also\nensuring we have the right policies, products and programs to allow all channels to compete effectively. Concurrently, we are optimizing our supply chain for high-demand eCommerce items to ensure customer and\nconsumer availability requirements are met at optimal cost. Finally, we are also investing in sales planning, net revenue management and price pack architecture.\nCentral: Fortify the Central Portfolio\nWe are managing each business differentially, based on clearly articulated strategies that define the role of each business within our portfolio. We regularly assess the profitability and growth potential of each\nof our businesses. All businesses have clear roles in the portfolio and a strategy that is consistent with that role. Some of our businesses are managed to optimize top-line growth, whereas others are more focused\non reducing costs and maximizing operating income.\nWe are building out our portfolio in attractive, broadly defined pet and garden markets. We intend to strengthen our portfolio with organic growth and acquisitions. Our M&A priorities are to build scale in our\ncore pet and garden categories, enter priority adjacencies and enhance key capabilities, including digital and eCommerce capabilities. We generally seek growth and margin accretive, brand-focused companies with\ntalented management teams. For example, we acquired TDBBS, LLC (\"TDBBS\") in 2023, a business in the attractive pet treat segment with strong eCommerce capabilities. We are also committed to divesting\nbusinesses where we cannot find a path to sustainable profitability. For instance, in 2023 we sold our low-margin distribution business into the independent garden channel.\nCentral Ventures, our venture fund which we established in 2020, further supports our M&A strategy. Our objective is to partner with leading entrepreneurs and innovators in the pet and garden industries and\nleverage our experience and capabilities to accelerate growth. The fund is primarily focused on three emerging growth areas in our two industries: sustainability, health and wellness, and digitally connected\nproducts and services.\nGrounded in our purpose to nurture happy and healthy homes, we are working towards a more sustainable future for all. We believe we have not only the opportunity but also the responsibility to make a\ndifference and drive positive change. Our Central Impact program - focused on protecting our planet, cultivating our communities, and empowering our employees - is our commitment and approach to corporate\nsustainability.\nCost: Reduce Cost to Improve Margins and Fuel Growth\nOptimizing our supply chain footprint is a priority as we seek to become more efficient and cost-effective while enabling our businesses to meet the demands of our existing and new customers. We have\nalready consolidated some of our dog and cat treat and toy businesses and numerous garden manufacturing facilities. Further, we combined our outdoor cushion business with our pet bed business given the\nsynergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation.\nWe are making progress toward significantly simplifying our business and improving our efficiency across the organization by rationalizing our footprint, streamlining our portfolio, and improving our cost\nstructure. Our Cost and Simplicity program spans procurement, logistics, manufacturing, portfolio optimization and administrative costs. We expect to reduce complexity, which means fewer SKUs, fewer plants and\nfewer distribution centers. We further expect lower cost of goods sold through lower logistics costs and better procurement, lower administrative costs through scale, leverage and efficiency, and a gradual shift in\nfocus to our higher margin, higher growth potential branded pet and garden consumer products. For example, we have closed several pet and garden manufacturing and distribution facilities, recently consolidated\nfour garden distribution locations into a new fulfillment center and are in the process of exiting our pottery business.\nCulture: Strengthen Our Entrepreneurial Business Unit-Led Growth Culture\nOur values, established by leaders across the organization, are the cornerstone of our culture, and they are at the root of every decision we make – we call them “The Central Way.” We believe having a strong\nset of values provides a foundation for employees and strengthens how we all work together. They comprise six simple values: “We do the right thing.” “We strive to be the best.” “We are entrepreneurial.” “We win\ntogether.” “We grow every day.” and “We are passionate.”\nEmployee well-being is a key part of creating a sustainable business and a passionate and effective team. We strive to achieve this by focusing on occupational health & safety, diversity & inclusion, and\nlearning & development.\nFor example, in fiscal 2023, we implemented our global health and safety policy across the organization, promoting our mission to prevent all injuries. Also, in fiscal 2023, the Women in Leadership Council,\ncomprised of female leaders from across the organization, held its inaugural virtual summit, themed \"Women are Central to Growth\". In fiscal 2024, the Council held its first in-person summit, themed \"We Rise by\nLifting Others\" enabling Central's women leaders to network and shape the Council's initiatives for impactful outcomes. We expanded the\n2\nCouncil's membership to include a greater representation of our female leadership and added a new Women's Leadership Track to our 2024 Mentorship Program.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe we have a number of competitive strengths, which serve as the foundation of our Central to Home strategy, including the following:\nBroad Portfolio of Leading Brands Across Key Pet and Garden Segments\nWe are one of the leaders in the U.S. pet supplies market and the lawn and garden consumables market. We have a diversified portfolio of brands in both segments, many of which are among the leading\nbrands in their respective market categories, ranging from Aqueon in aquatics, Cadet in dog treats and chews, Farnam in equine, Four Paws in waste management and grooming, K&H in heated pet products,\nKaytee in pet bird and small animal, and Nylabone in dog toys and treats to Amdro in controls, Ferry-Morse in packet seed and Pennington in wild bird products, grass seed and fertilizer. The majority of our brands\nhave been marketed and sold for more than 40 years.\nRobust Financial Performance\nWe have demonstrated strength in our financial performance, in net sales, earnings and cash flow. Our net sales grew on average 6.1% annually over the last five years, driven by acquisitions and organic\ngrowth. Operating income grew on average 4.0% on a GAAP basis annually over the same period. We have a strong cash and liquidity position driven by a combination of capital raises and cash flow from\noperations which puts us in a strong position to grow further through both acquisitions and organically.\nProven Track Record of M&A\nSince 1992, we have completed over 60 acquisitions to create a company of approximately $3.2 billion in net sales. These acquisitions have successfully expanded the breadth of our pet and garden portfolios.\nMost recently, in November 2023, we acquired TDBBS, a provider of premium natural dog chews and treats. The addition of TDBBS expanded our portfolio with bully and collagen sticks, bones and jerky, added\nscale to our dog and cat business and enhance our eCommerce and digital capabilities.\nWe are a patient and disciplined value buyer, typically focused on opportunities that build scale in our core pet and garden categories or in priority adjacencies, with a recent emphasis on those that enhance\nkey capabilities, for example in digital and eCommerce. We are open to businesses that, on top of traditional operating synergies, can leverage our expertise and capabilities and allow us to add value through our\nlow-cost manufacturing and distribution competencies. We generally prefer to acquire brand-focused businesses with growth and margin rates above Central’s rates, with proven, seasoned management teams,\nwho are committed to stay with the acquired business. We have been successful in growing our acquisitions organically after acquiring them into our portfolio. We continually review our businesses to ensure they\nmeet expectations and have implemented strategies to reverse sub-par performance or take other appropriate action when necessary.\nStrong Relationships with Retailers\nWe have developed strong relationships with major and independent brick & mortar and online retailers, providing them broad product offerings including new product innovation, premium brands, private label\nprograms, proprietary sales and logistics capabilities and a high level of customer service. Major retailers value the efficiency of dealing with suppliers with national scope and strong brands. We believe our ability to\nmeet their unique needs for packaging and point of sale displays provides us with a competitive advantage. Independent retailers value our high level of customer service and broad array of premium branded\nproducts. We believe these strengths have assisted us in becoming one of the largest pet supplies vendors to Costco, Amazon and Walmart, and a leading supplier to independent pet retailers in the United States\nand among the largest lawn and garden consumables vendors to Home Depot, Walmart and Lowe’s. In addition, we are a leading pet and lawn and garden supplier for the food, drug and mass merchandise\nchannels.\nHome Depot, our largest customer, represented approximately 17% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2024 and 16% in fiscal 2023. Walmart, our second largest customer, represented approximately\n16% of our total net sales in fiscal 2024 and 16% in fiscal 2023. Costco, Lowe's and Amazon are also significant customers, and together with Home Depot and Walmart, they accounted for approximately 54% of\nour net sales in fiscal 2024 and 52% in fiscal 2023.\nLeading Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution Network\nWe manufacture the majority of our branded products in our network of manufacturing facilities, located primarily in the United States. In addition, some of our proprietary branded products are manufactured by\ncontract manufacturers, including one of our registered active ingredients, (S)-Methoprene, which is manufactured by a third party under an exclusive arrangement.\nWe are a leading supplier to independent specialty retailers for the pet supplies market and to select national retailers for the lawn and garden consumables market. Our sales and distribution facilities are\nstrategically placed across the United States to allow us to service both our mass market customers, as well as independent pet specialty retail stores, serving traditional brick-and-mortar but increasingly also\n3\nomnichannel and pure-play retailers selling only through the internet. In addition, we operate facilities in China, Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. This network also supports distribution of many other\nmanufacturers’ brands and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments, enabling us to serve our customers in an effective and cost-efficient manner. We believe this gives us a\ncompetitive advantage over other suppliers, as this network provides us with key access to independent pet specialty retail stores and select national retail lawn and garden customers that require two-step\ndistribution, facilitating acquisition and maintenance of shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid\ndeployment and feedback for new products and immediate exposure for new internally developed and acquired brands.\nWe plan to continue to utilize our team of dedicated salespeople and our sales and logistics networks to expand sales of our branded pet and garden products.\nStrong and Experienced Leadership Team\nOur leadership team is committed to delivering value for all our stakeholders and is comprised of highly tenured professionals, combining both deep Central and consumer products industry expertise. We\nbelieve the depth and breadth of their perspectives and experiences create an optimal foundation for our entrepreneurial business-unit led growth culture and facilitates innovation, which is critical to capturing and\nmaintaining market share.\nIn 2023, our Chairman and founder, William E. Brown, was recognized with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award by the World Pet Association for his achievements and contributions in the pet industry.\nPet Segment\nPet Overview\nWe are one of the leading producers and marketers of branded pet supplies in the United States. We also produce numerous private label brands. In addition, our Pet segment operates one of the largest sales\nand distribution networks in the industry, strategically supporting our brands.\nPet Industry Background\nThe pet industry includes food, supplies, veterinary care and non-medical services, and live animals. We operate primarily in the pet supplies segment of the industry as well as in the live fish and small animal\ncategories. The pet supplies segment includes: dog and cat treats and chews, toys, beds and containment, grooming products, waste management and training pads; supplies for aquatics, small animals, reptiles\nand pet birds including toys, enclosures and habitats, bedding, food and supplements; products for equine and livestock, animal and household health and insect control products; live fish and small animals. The\ntotal annual retail sales of the pet food, treats and chews, supplies, veterinary and non-medical services and live animal industry in 2024 was estimated by Packaged Facts to be approximately $151 billion. We\nexpect the industry to continue to grow from that foundation. Based on Packaged Facts estimates for 2024, we estimate the annual retail sales of the pet supplies, treats and chews, and live animal markets in the\ncategories in which we participate to be approximately $39 billion.\nAccording to Packaged Facts, the U.S. pet supplies market is highly fragmented with over 2,500 manufacturers, ranging from mostly single-category or limited-range players to approximately two dozen\ncompanies with a solid multi-category presence. The majority of these smaller companies do not have a captive sales and logistics network and rely on us or other independent distributors to supply their products to\nregional pet specialty chains and independent retailers.\nThe pet food and supplies industry retail channel is composed of a wide range of retailers, from national chains like Petco and PetSmart to approximately 5,900 independent/non-chain pet stores in addition to\nmass-market, farm & feed stores, online and other retailers. Pure play online players have grown to be an increasingly significant share of pet retail, by capitalizing on the shift to omni shopping driven by the\npandemic. Continued growth is expected to come from digitally-savvy, native eCommerce shoppers aging into prime pet ownership years and projected to spend significantly more than previous generations.\nTraditional mass-market and pet specialty brick & mortar have ramped up their eCommerce and omnichannel capabilities in the last five years to remain competitive and minimize attrition. Independent pet stores\ncontinue to suffer from the expanded competition in offerings and capabilities from online, mass-market, and pet chain retailers.\nLong-Term Pet Industry Characteristics\nLong term, we believe the U.S. pet supplies market will continue to grow due to favorable trends tracking within the pet industry, including the demographics shift to younger shoppers, humanization and\npremiumization, and health and wellness. Pet ownership is now split equally between younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials) and older generations (Gen X and Baby Boomers), with the younger generations\nspending more on their pet in the past year. A 2024 Packaged Facts survey found that across generations, the majority of pet owners depend on their pets intensely for companionship, affection, fun and mental and\nphysical health benefits. The same survey found that approximately 95% of U.S. pet owners view their pet as family. Moreover, younger adults see pets as companions and a precursor to\n4\nparenthood, and pets are interwoven into all aspects of life. This motivates the majority of pet owners to look for products that promote overall health and well-being.\nBranded Pet Products\nOur principal pet supplies categories are dog and cat supplies, treats and chews; aquatics and reptile supplies, small animal and pet bird supplies, animal health products as well as live fish and small animals.\nAmong our leading brands are: Nylabone in dog toys and treats, Kaytee in pet birds and small animal, Farnam in equine, C&S in suet, Aqueon in aquatics and Comfort Zone in cat calming. In addition, we operate\nour Arden Companies® outdoor cushion business in the Pet segment due to synergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation with our pet bed business.\nWe continuously seek to introduce new products, both as complementary extensions of existing product lines and in new product categories. In fiscal 2024, Nylabone extended its Gourmet Style line with new\nshapes and flavors. Cadet announced an all new line of rawhide alternatives and added new flavors to it premium treats. Paw Love debuted a new line of natural dog chews called Simply Smoked. In fiscal 2023, our\nNylabone brand launched a new collection of play toys for imaginative fun as well as four new product lines that include a variety of chew toys and chew treats. These releases feature chew toy s hapes inspired by\neveryday objects with a fun twist; multi-flavored Basted Blast chew toys; the Sneaky SnackerTM chew & treat toy; and Healthy Edibles® Meaty Center chew treats. And our Cadet brand introduced a unique line of\nall-natural, highly palatable, and digestible long-lasting chews called Bully Hide.\nOver the last two years, many of our pet products have won industry awards. Aqueon won “Health Focused Product of the Year” and “Waste Innovation of the Year” in the 2023 Pet Innovation Awards in\naddition to “Runner Up” at the SuperZoo New Product Showcase. In fiscal 2023, Nylabone was selected as a finalist in the 2022 Pet Product News Editors’ Choice Awards for its Gourmet Style chew toys.\nDog and Cat. We are an industry leader in premium edible and non-edible chews, supplements, interactive toys, grooming supplies, beds and containment, training and waste management solutions featuring\nthe brands Best Bully Sticks, Cadet, Four Paws, Healthy Edibles®, K&H, Healthy PromiseTM, Nylabone, Nubz®, and Paw Love® among others.\nSmall Animal and Bird Supplies.

We offer a full range of products including species specific diets, treats, habitats,\nbedding, hay and toys under the Kaytee brand. Our Kaytee small animal and pet bird food mixes are fortified with a proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals. We also offer a complete portfolio of Kaytee wild bird\nfood and C&S suet products for backyard birding. Our brands are some of the most widely recognized and trusted brands for birds and small animals.\nAnimal Health (Health & Wellness, Equine and Professional). We supply calming products under the Comfort Zone brand, and flea and tick controls under the Adams ® brand. We also offer innovative products\nfor horses in the fly control, supplements, grooming, deworming, wound care, leather care and rodenticides categories. Our portfolio of brands for equine includes Farnam, Horse Health™ Products, Vita Flex®, Just\nOne Bite® and Rodentex™. These brands, along with sub-brands including Bronco®, Endure®, IverCare®, Horseshoer’s Secret®, Red Cell®, Sand Clear™, Super Mask® II and Vetrolin® position us as a leader in\nthese categories. Moreover, we are a leading supplier of insect control products sold into various markets. We are the only domestic provider of (S)-Methoprene, which is an active ingredient used to control\nmosquitoes, flies, fleas, beetles and ants in many professional and consumer insect control applications. Our products are sold primarily under the Starbar® and Zoëcon® family of brands, as well as standalone\nbrands such as Altosid®, Centynal™, ClariFly®IGR, Diacon®, Essentria® and Extinguish®. We also sell (S)-Methoprene to manufacturers of other insect control products, including Frontline Plus.\nAquatics and Reptile Supplies. We are a leading manufacturer of aquariums and terrariums as well as related fixtures and stands, water conditioners and supplements, water pumps and filters, sophisticated\nlighting systems and accessories under the brands Aqueon, Blagdon®, Coralife®, Interpet® and Zilla.\nLive Fish and Small Animals. Segrest and SunPet are leading wholesalers of aquarium fish and plants, reptiles and small animals to pet specialty and mass merchandiser stores as well as public aquariums\nand research institutions.\nOutdoor cushions. We sell Arden-branded outdoor cushions through major retailers, both in-store and online, and private label outdoor cushions through the largest big box stores in North America, all\nleveraging Arden's EverTru®-branded outdoor fabric. Our OceanTex™ fabrics, developed by EverTru, are responsibly made and composed of up to 100% recycled materials, including reclaimed ocean plastic and\nfishing nets.\nPet Sales and Distribution Network\nOur domestic sales and distribution network promotes both our proprietary brands and third-party brands. It provides value-added service to over 10,000 retailers, many of which are independent specialty\nstores with fewer than 10 locations, and over 6,000 veterinary offices. This includes acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs,\nquick response to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products and immediate exposure for acquired brands. The combination of brands in the network that are\nsupplied in single shipments enables our independent customers to collaborate with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their pet supplies requirements. We also operate a sales and logistics facility in the United\nKingdom.\n5\nPet Sales and Marketing\nOur sales strategy is multi-tiered and designed to maximize market share with retailers. Our customers include retailers, such as club, regional and national specialty pet stores, independent pet retailers, food,\ndrug and mass stores, as well as the eCommerce channel. We also serve the professional market with insect control and health and wellness products for use by veterinarians, municipalities, farmers and equine\nproduct suppliers. Costco accounted for approximately 14% of our Pet segment's net sales in fiscal 2024, and 13% in fiscal 2023. Amazon, Walmart, Petco and Kroger are also significant customers.\nTo optimize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, our focused sales resources are segmented as follows:\n• a sales organization operating by category and channel;\n• dedicated account teams servicing our largest customers;\n• a group of account managers focused on regional chains;\n• a geographic based group of territory managers dedicated to the independent retailer; and\n• a specialized group of account managers dedicated to the professional and equine markets.\nThese sales teams deliver our marketing strategy that is consumer, brand and channel driven. We provide value creation with a focus on innovation, product quality and performance, premium packaging,\nproduct positioning and consumer value. We collaborate closely with our customers to identify their needs, jointly develop strategies to meet those needs and deliver programs that include digital execution, print,\nbroadcast and direct mail. We continue to invest in talent, innovation, brand building, digital capabilities and eCommerce as these play a critical role in our ambition to lead in the pet segment.\nIn fiscal 2024, Farnam partnered with country music trio The Castellows to debut the brands' new logo to be used across all point of sale and marketing, including a new Amazon storefront. At the 2024 Global\nPet Expo, D&D Commodities took third place in best in show for its Wild Delight Squirrel Away Zero-Waste bird feed and our Reptifauna bioactive plants won second place in the Reptile best in show category.\nBarkworthies' new floor display won first place in the point of purchase category at SuperZoo.\nPet Competition\nThe pet supplies industry is highly competitive and has experienced considerable consolidation. Our branded pet products compete against national and regional branded products and private label products\nproduced by various suppliers. Our largest competitors in the product categories in which we participate are Mars, Inc., Spectrum Brands and the J.M. Smucker Co. The Pet segment competes primarily on the\nbasis of brand recognition, innovation, upscale packaging, quality and service. Our Pet segment’s sales and distribution network competes with Animal Supply Co., Phillips Pet Food & Supplies and a number of\nsmaller local and regional distributors, with competition based on product selection, price, value-added services and personal relationships.\nGarden Segment\nGarden Overview\nWe are a leader in the consumer lawn and garden consumables market in the United States and offer both premium and value-oriented branded products. We also produce numerous private label products for\nkey customers. In addition, our Garden segment operates a sales and distribution network that strategically supports our brands.\nGarden Industry Background\nThe garden industry includes consumables such as grass and other seeds, fertilizer, controls, live plants, wild bird products as well as soil and mulch, and durables such as landscaping and decorative products\nincluding pottery, outdoor furniture, water features, lighting, arches and trellises. The total lawn and garden consumables industry in the United States is estimated by Packaged Facts, the Freedonia Group,\nNumerator and internal estimates to be approximately $31 billion in annual retail sales in 2024, including grass and other seeds, fertilizer, controls, live goods, wild bird products as well as soil and mulch. We\nestimate the annual retail sales of the lawn and garden consumables market in the categories in which we participate to be approximately $30 billion.\nThe lawn and garden consumables market is highly concentrated with most products sold to consumers through a number of distribution channels, including home centers, mass merchants, independent\nnurseries and hardware stores. Home and garden centers and mass merchants typically carry multiple premium and value brands.\nLong-Term Garden Industry Characteristics\nTransitioning from COVID highs to a new normal level, the lawn and garden industry has experienced volatility driven by supply chain challenges, unpredictable weather patterns, and retailer destocking\ninitiatives. Based on estimates of Freedonia Group, we expect the\n6\nindustry sales for 2024 to remain above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Gardening, lawn care, and outdoor recreation continue to be popular among many consumers. Lifestyle changes and shifts in demographics are\ncreating new opportunities in gardening, including convenience through easy-to-use products and smaller package sizes, premiumization, customization, urbanization, and sustainability as well as transforming large\ngrass spaces into planned gardens intended to be easier to maintain. Millennials and Gen Z’s have high engagement and participation in gardening and house plant ownership. Interest in outdoor living is\nparticularly high among millennials, the nation's largest group of gardeners.\nBranded Lawn and Garden Products\nOur principal lawn and garden consumables product lines are grass seed, wild bird products, lawn and garden care products including fertilizers, insect control products, live plants and packet seed to help\nconsumers grow their lawns greener and gardens bloom bigger. Our Pennington brand is one of the largest in grass seed, wild bird feed and birding accessories. Ferry-Morse is a leader in vegetable, herb and\nflower packet seed, and our Amdro brand is a leading portfolio of control products.\nWe continuously introduce new products, both as complementary extensions of existing product lines and in new product categories. In fiscal 2024, Ferry-Morse introduced its Colossal Seed collection that will\ngrow vegetables at least double the average size and expanded the line of organic seeds, which now features more than 100 organic vegetables, fruit and herb see varieties. In fiscal 2023,Ferry-Morse introduced\nmore than 40 different Plantlings™ Garden Starter Kits, curated bundles of Plantlings that complement each other and take the guesswork out of planning and buying.\nGrass Seed. We are a leading manufacturer of numerous varieties and mixtures of cool and warm season grass seed for both the residential and professional markets, as well as forage and wildlife seed\nmixtures. We sell these products under the Pennington brand along with several sub-brands including Lawn Booster, One Step Complete®, Rackmaster®, Slopemaster®, Smart Seed, Smart Patch, The Rebels® and\nother brand names. We also produce numerous private label brands of grass seed. The Pennington grass seed manufacturing facilities are some of the largest and most modern seed coating and conditioning\nfacilities in the industry.\nWild Bird. We are the leading producer of wild bird feed. These products are sold under the Pennington, 3-D ® Pet Products and Wild Delight® brands. Many of our branded wild bird feed mixes are treated with\na proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals. For example, our Pennington brand feed mixes are enriched with Bird-Kote®, our exclusive process which literally seals each seed with a nutritious coating containing\nvitamins and minerals that are beneficial to the health of wild birds. We also manufacture bird feeders, bird houses and other birding accessories.\nFertilizer and Controls. We are a leading manufacturer of soil supplements and stimulants. We produce several lines of lawn and garden fertilizers and soil supplements in granular and liquid form under the\nAlaska® Fish Fertilizer, Ironite®, Pennington, Pro Care® and Superthrive® brand names and other private and controlled labels. We also manufacture lawn and garden weed, moss, insect and pest control products.\nWe sell these products under brands such as Amdro, Corry’s®, Daconil®, IMAGE®, Knockout™, Lilly Miller®, Moss Out®, Over-N-Out®, Rootboost™ and Sevin, as well as other private and controlled labels.\nLive Plants. With Bell Nursery, we are the primary supplier of superior quality flowers, trees, shrubs and other plants to Home Depot in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, producing and shipping tens of\nmillions of annuals, perennials and indoor plants each year, also offering items we do not grow, such as orchids.\nPacket Seed. We are a leading provider of vegetable, herb and flower packet seeds and seed starters. We sell these products under the American Seed ®, Ferry-Morse, Jiffy®, Livingston®, McKenzie® Seed\nand other brand names.\nGarden Sales and Distribution Network\nOur sales and distribution network promotes our proprietary brands and provides us with key access to select national retail chains for our branded products, acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf\nplacement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products, market intelligence\nand potential acquisition targets. The network also sells other manufacturers’ brands of lawn and garden supplies and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments enabling select\nnational retail chains to deal with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their lawn and garden supplies requirements.\nGarden Sales and Marketing\nThe marketing strategy for our premium products is focused on meeting consumer needs through product performance, innovation, quality, upscale packaging and retail shelf placement. The marketing\nstrategy for our value products is focused on promotion of the quality and efficacy of our value brands at a lower cost relative to premium brands.\nIn 2024, we refreshed our Amdro brand with new eye-catching packaging graphics and optimized product claims that are simple and relevant to consumers.\n7\nOur customers include retailers, such as home improvement centers, food, drug and mass merchants, and professional end users. Sales to Home Depot represented approximately 38% and 35%, sales to\nWalmart represented approximately 27% and 24% and sales to Lowe’s represented approximately 15% and 14% of our Garden segment’s net sales in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTo maximize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, we market our products through\n• dedicated sales forces representing our combined brand groups;\n• a retail sales and logistics network, which provides in-store training and merchandising for our customers, especially during the prime spring and summer seasons;\n• dedicated account-managers and sales teams located near several of our largest customers; and\n• selected independent distributors who sell our brands.\nWe continue to invest in talent, digital capabilities and eCommerce as these play a critical role in our ambition to grow our business and lead in the Garden segment.\nGarden Competition\nThe lawn and garden consumables industry is highly competitive. Our lawn and garden products compete against national, regional and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our turf and forage\ngrass seed products, fertilizers, pesticides and combination products compete principally against products marketed by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. In addition, Spectrum Brands and S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc.\nare strong competitors in yard and household insecticides. Our Garden segment competes primarily based on its strong premium and value brands, quality, service, price and low-cost manufacturing.\nSeasonality\nWhile demand for our pet supplies products, except for pest controls, is generally balanced over the year, our lawn and garden consumables business is highly seasonal with approximately two-thirds of net\nsales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. We build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt, so the backlog of unfilled orders is not\nmaterial. Funding for working capital items, including inventory and receivables, is normally sourced from operating cash flows and short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For additional information\non our liquidity, working capital management, cash flow and financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Note 11, Long-Term Debt, appearing later in this Form 10-K.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe purchase most of our raw materials from multiple suppliers but obtain one of the raw materials used to manufacture (S)-Methoprene from a single source of supply. We maintain an inventory of this raw\nmaterial (in addition to our (S)-Methoprene inventory) to reduce the possibility of interruption in the availability of (S)-Methoprene, since a prolonged delay in obtaining (S)-Methoprene or this raw material could result\nin a temporary delay in product shipments and have an adverse effect on our Pet segment’s financial results.\nThe key ingredients in our fertilizer and insect and weed control products are commodity and specialty chemicals, including urea, potash, phosphates, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. The prices of\nthese raw materials are susceptible to fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, inflation, and government regulations. We continuously monitor and evaluate our supplier network for quality, cost, and\nmanufacturing capacity.\nThe principal raw materials required for our bird feed are bulk commodity grains, including millet, milo and sunflower seeds, which are generally purchased from large national commodity companies and local\ngrain cooperatives. In order to ensure an adequate supply of grains and seeds to satisfy expected production volume, we enter into contracts to purchase a portion of our expected grain and seed requirements at\nfuture dates by fixing the quantity, and often the price, at the commitment date. Although we have never experienced a severe interruption of supply, we are exposed to price risk with respect to the portion of our\nsupply which is not covered by contracts with a fixed price.\nPatents, Trademarks and Other Proprietary Rights\nWe hold numerous patents in the United States and in other countries and have several patent applications pending. We consider the development of patents through creative research and the maintenance of\nan active patent program to be advantageous to our business, but do not regard any particular patent as essential to our operations. In addition to patents, we have numerous active ingredient registrations, end-use\nproduct registrations and trade secrets. Along with patents, active ingredient registrations, end use product registrations and trade secrets, we own numerous trademarks, service marks, trade names and logotypes.\nMany of our trademarks are registered. For those that are not, we rely on our common law trademark rights.\n8\nHuman Capital Management\nEvery Central Team member and every job is important to our success and helping us to achieve our purpose. As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 6,450 employees, of whom approximately 6,100\nwere full-time employees and 350 were temporary or part-time employees. We also hire substantial numbers of additional temporary employees for the peak lawn and garden shipping season of February through\nJune to meet the increased demand during the spring and summer months. The majority of our temporary employees are paid on an hourly basis. Except for approximately 100 employees at our facilities in Puebla,\nMexico and Brandon, Canada, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. The attrition rate of our non-seasonal full-time and part-time workforce was 30% in fiscal 2024.\nWe believe that attracting, developing and retaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is important to our continued success. Women represent 40% of our non-seasonal employees, and one of our key priorities\nis to amplify opportunities for women. Women serve in several senior leadership roles, holding 33% of leadership positions (defined as Managers, Directors and Senior leaders (Vice President and above), including\nour General Counsel & Secretary, Interim Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Senior Vice President Pet Consumer Marketing, Vice President Digital Marketing & Commerce, Vice President Investor\nRelations & Corporate Sustainability, Vice President Risk Management and Real Estate, Vice President Tax, Vice President eCommerce Sales, President Segrest, General Manager Health & Wellness and Vice\nPresident Pet Sales.\nWe recognize that financial stability is a critical component to our employees’ well-being. Our competitive compensation programs include base salary or hourly compensation for all employees. In addition, we\nprovide a discretionary annual 401k employer contribution and a bonus program for eligible employees, which is based on the success of our businesses as measured by designated performance metrics and\nindividual performance contributions. Another component of our overall compensation program is long-term equity, which is offered to eligible employees through annual and individual grants. We use such long-\nterm equity grants as a means of attracting and retaining key employees to reward performance and to give these employees a vested interest in the success of the Company. Moreover, our physical health\nprograms, like our medical and dental coverage, help our employees to feel their best on the job and at home.\nDeveloping our employees so that they can assume key roles within Central is an important strategic priority for us. We offer a variety of programs and resources to train and enhance the skill set of our\nworkforce, including a robust online learning platform with a wide variety of course offerings, a mentoring program and a tuition reimbursement program that subsidizes college and advanced degrees for eligible\nemployees. We also engage in regular discussions around succession planning and talent development at all levels of the Company. Our Board has frequent contact with business leaders within the organization\nand participates actively in the succession planning process. Our Interim Senior Vice President of Human Resources reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and works with management to evaluate internal\ntalent for future leadership positions within the organization on an ongoing basis. In evaluating potential acquisitions, an important consideration is the quality of the management team of the target company and our\nability to obtain sufficient assurance that such management will remain with Central as needed if and after we acquire the business.\nWe encourage and drive high standards in our occupational health and safety performance by recording, reporting and investigating all incidents to root cause. In the ongoing push for progress, we set new\nannual safety targets and invest in our operational capabilities. While we have improved our recordable incident rate by 10% on average over the last four years, the recordable incident rate was slightly higher in\nfiscal 2024 compared to the prior year.\nRegulatory Considerations\nMany of the products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations. Such regulations are often complex and are subject to change. For example, in the\nUnited States, all pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), in addition to individual state registrations before they can be sold. Fertilizer products are also\nsubject to state Department of Agriculture registration regulations. Grass and other seeds are also subject to state and federal labeling regulations. Prior to any international sales, all foreign agency requirements for\nshipment and labeling must be met.\nThe Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”) establishes a standard for food-use pesticides, which is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under this\nAct, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. Any pesticides in our products that are approved to be used on foods are evaluated by the EPA as part of this\nnon-dietary exposure risk assessment.\nIn addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that\nonly certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on\nproperties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification of individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients.\nVarious federal, state and local laws, including the federal Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), also regulate pet food products and give regulatory authorities the power to recall or require re-labeling of\nproducts. Several new FSMA regulations have become effective in recent years.\n9\nVarious local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did\nnot actually cause the contamination. In the course of our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and most of these facilities have not been subjected to\nPhase II environmental tests to determine whether they are contaminated.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nThe long-term profitability of our business requires us to do our part to protect the planet, care for the local areas we serve, and provide our employees a safe, healthy and rewarding workplace. Corporate\nsustainability is embedded throughout our long-term enterprise roadmap and brought to life through our Central Impact strategy. Our 2022-2023 Impact Report provides additional information about our commitment\nto and progress to protect our planet, cultivate our communities and empower our employees. The report can be found on our website www.central.com.\nIn fiscal 2024, Nylabone was accredited by the Pet Sustainability Coalition (PSC) as a sustainably led and measured business that drives positive impact for pets, people, and the planet. In fiscal 2023, Central\nwas recognized for its efforts in promoting eco-conscious procurement practices by ODP Business Solutions.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth the name, age and position of our executive officers as of November 25, 2024.\nName 1 Age Position\nWilliam E.

We make available free of charge, on or through our website, our annual, quarterly and current reports, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably\npracticable after electronically filing or furnishing such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information contained on our web site is not part of this report.\n11\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors\nboth in and out of our control, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below. In addition, the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. We have only described the risks we consider to be material. However, there may\nbe additional risks that are viewed by us as not material at the present time or are not presently known to us. Conditions could change in the future, or new information may come to our attention that could impact\nour assessment of these risks.\nIf any of the events described below were to occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. When we say below that something could or\nwill have a material adverse effect on us, we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects. In any such case, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment in our company.\nRisks Affecting our Business\nEconomic uncertainty and other adverse macro-economic conditions, including high interest rates and potential tariffs, may harm our business.\nOur revenues and margins are dependent on various economic factors, including interest rates, the potential of an economic recession, trade tariffs, energy costs, consumer attitudes toward discretionary\nspending, currency fluctuations, rates of inflation and other macro-economic factors which may impact consumer spending. While the rate of inflation continued to slow during fiscal 2024, and a recession has not\nmaterialized, interest rates remain high and the imposition of tariffs on imports by the new presidential administration could result in higher input costs. If we are unable to pass through higher input costs by raising\nthe price of our products, we may experience organic sales declines and gross margin and operating income declines.\nTariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and our financial results.\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, the President-Elect stated his intention to impose significant tariffs on goods imported from China and other countries. During the President-Elect’s prior administration,\nthe United States imposed a series of tariffs, ranging from 5% to 25%, on a variety of imports from China and subsequently implemented tariffs on additional goods imported from China. Less than 15% of our cost of\ngoods sold is from products or materials sourced from outside the United States, including less than 5% from China. To the extent the United States imposes new or additional tariffs on China or other countries, or if\nnew or additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries in connection with a global trade war, the cost of our products manufactured in China or other countries, and\nimported into the United States could increase significantly, which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to continue to source products from China.\nWe outsource a portion of our manufacturing requirements to third-party manufacturers located in China. This subjects us to a number of risks, including: the impact of Chinese public health and contamination\nrisks on manufacturing; quality control issues; social and political disturbances and instability; export duties, import controls, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers; shipping and transportation problems; and\nfluctuations in currency values. These risks may be heightened by threatened changes in the U.S. government's trade policies, including the continuation of tariffs on goods imported from China or the imposition of\nany new or increased tariffs. Because we rely on Chinese third-party manufacturers for a significant portion of our product needs, any disruption in our relationships with these manufacturers or significant increase\nin import tariffs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nHigh energy prices could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn fiscal 2024, energy prices remained elevated, resulting in increased costs for fuel and raw materials for many of our products. Energy prices may continue to rise or remain elevated during fiscal 2025.\nContinued high energy prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which would reduce our sales and operating income.\nA decline in consumers’ discretionary spending or a change in consumer preferences could reduce our sales and harm our business.\nOur sales ultimately depend on consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including high interest rates, the potential for trade tariffs, a return to an inflationary\nenvironment or an economic recession, other general economic\nconditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, weather, consumer confidence and unemployment levels. Any material decline in consumer discretionary spending could reduce our sales and harm our\nbusiness. Unfavorable economic and market conditions may also place a number of our key retail customers under financial stress, which would increase our credit risk and potential bad debt exposure.\nThe success of our business also depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Our failure to timely identify or effectively respond to\nchanging consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and lawn and garden and pet care needs could adversely affect the demand for our products and our profitability.\nOur operating results and cash flow are susceptible to fluctuations.\nWe expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales, net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis. Factors that may contribute to this variability include:\n• the uncertain macro-economic environment, including high interest rates and the potential imposition of trade tariffs, could lead to a recession, and the impact any of those could have on consumer\ndiscretionary spending;\n• seasonality and the impact of adverse weather conditions;\n• fluctuations in prices of commodity grains and other input costs;\n• supply chain and sourcing disruptions, including due to the volatile geopolitical environment and the potential imposition of trade tariffs on countries from which we import products;\n• a return to high inflation and the ability to take pricing actions to mitigate high input costs, including for commodities;\n• shifts in demand for lawn and garden and pet products;\n• changes in product mix, service levels, marketing and pricing by us and our competitors;\n• the effect of acquisitions; and\n• the strength of our relationships with key retailers and their buying patterns and economic stability.\nThese fluctuations could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock.\nOur lawn and garden sales are highly seasonal and subject to adverse weather and climate change.\nBecause our lawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer, the Garden business is seasonal. In fiscal 2024, approximately 66% of our Garden segment’s net sales and 59% of our\ntotal net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment’s operating income is generated in this period. Our working capital needs and our borrowings generally\npeak in our second fiscal quarter because we are generating lower revenues while incurring expenses in preparation for the spring selling season. If cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility are ever\ninsufficient to meet our seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay our borrowings on a timely basis, this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nBecause demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season, our results of operations and cash flow could also be\nadversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, heavy rains, water shortages or floods. From time to time, we have experienced unfavorable weather during the\npeak garden season, which adversely impacted our Garden sales. Unfavorable weather during the peak garden season in the future could have a significant adverse effect on the sales and profitability of our lawn\nand garden business.\nClimate change continues to receive increasing global attention. The effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing\ntemperature levels. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities and energy, which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required\nfor the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require.\nThe increase in climate change attention has resulted in evolving policy, legal and regulatory changes which may impose substantial operational and compliance burdens. Collecting, measuring and analyzing\ninformation relating to such matters can be costly, time-consuming, dependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Furthermore, methodologies for measuring, tracking and reporting on such matters continue\nto change over time, which requires our processes and controls for such data to evolve as well. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, customer reporting requirements, or stricter\ninterpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers, in which case, the costs of raw materials and component parts could increase.\nConsumers and businesses may independently change their behavior because of concerns regarding the impact of climate change and public perceptions. For example, consumers may elect to garden less\nfrequently than historic patterns due to the unpredictability of\nweather patterns. Those consumers who are less directly impacted by climate change may also engage in less gardening due to discomfort or concerns about perceptions stemming from the direct impact of climate\nchange on others. Current or potential retail customers may pull back from all or parts of the lawn and garden category in response to softening consumer demand.\nOur failure to adequately manage the political, legal, regulatory, consumer and retail impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nWe are in the process of implementing our Central to Home strategy, which could result in increased expenses over the next few years.\nOur Central to Home strategy consists of a comprehensive series of organizational and operational initiatives intended to build and grow our consumer brands, create a leading eCommerce platform and\nstrengthen our relationships with key customers, drive a strong portfolio strategy, reduce costs to improve margins and fuel growth and strengthen our entrepreneurial, business unit-led growth culture. We expect to\ncontinue to implement these initiatives over the next several years. We anticipate continuing to incur substantial costs relating to this strategy in each of the next several years. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to successfully execute our Central to Home strategic initiatives or that we will be able to do so within the anticipated time period. During the process of implementation, we will be making substantial\ninvestments in our business and will incur substantial transitional costs. These investments and transitional costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to execute on our Cost and Simplicity Program, our ability to maintain or grow margins may be negatively impacted.\nOur Cost and Simplicity program involves reducing costs, including procurement, logistics, manufacturing, portfolio optimization and administrative, and reducing complexity through fewer SKUs, plants and\ndistribution centers. Optimizing our supply chain footprint and having the right facilities in the right locations is critical to lowering costs. We plan to simplify our business and improve our efficiency across the\norganization by rationalizing our footprint, streamlining our portfolio, and improving our cost structure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our Cost and Simplicity program or that\nwe will be able to do so within the anticipated time period, which could adversely impact our ability to improve or maintain margins and enhance long-term profitability.\nSeeds and grains we use to produce bird feed and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that could have a negative impact on us.\nOur financial results are partially dependent upon the cost of raw materials and our ability to pass along increases in these costs to our customers. In particular, our Pennington and Kaytee businesses are\nexposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodity seeds and grains used to produce bird feed and grass seed. Historically, market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a\nnumber of factors, including changes in U.S. government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons.\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in market prices, we enter into purchase contracts for grains, bird feed and grass seed to cover a limited portion of our purchase requirements for a selling season. Since\nthese contracts cover only a portion of our purchase requirements, as market prices for such products increase, our cost of production increases as well. In contrast, if market prices for such products decrease, we\nmay end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market.\nIn the past, periods of high inflation or supply constraints have resulted in higher costs for bird feed and grass seed. Beginning in fiscal 2023, there has been a prolonged oversupply of grass seed, which has\nresulted in a significant decline in market prices. As a result of this decline, in fiscal 2024, we incurred an approximately $15-$20 million charge to write-down the value of our grass seed inventory. We can provide\nno assurance as to the timing or extent of our ability to implement price increases in the event of high costs in the future, or our ability to maintain pricing with our retailers in the context of declining costs. We also\ncannot predict to what extent price increases may negatively affect our sales volume or price decreases may result in further inventory write-downs. As retailers pass along price increases, consumers may shift to\nour lower margin bird feed, switch to competing products or reduce purchases of wild bird feed products. The same shift in consumer behavior could adversely affect our business in other product categories which\nexperience substantial price increases.\nWe are subject to significant risks associated with innovation, including the risk that our new product innovations will not produce sufficient sales to recoup our\ninvestment.\nWe believe that our future success will depend upon, in part, our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop, market and produce new products. We cannot\nassure you that we will be successful in the introduction, marketing and production of any new products or product innovations, or that we will develop and introduce in a timely manner, improvements to our existing\nproducts which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop new products or improved formulations\nand introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that the period of time to gain consumer acceptance of major innovations is longer in the garden industry than in many industries, which compounds the risks generally associated with major new\nproduct innovations.\nWe depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our business.\nHome Depot, our largest customer, represented approximately 17% of our total company net sales in fiscal year 2024 and 16% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Walmart, our second\nlargest customer, represented approximately 16% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2024 and 2023, and 17% in fiscal 2022. Costco, our third largest customer, represented approximately 8%, 7% and 6% of\nour total company net sales in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Lowe's and Amazon are also significant customers, and together with Walmart, Home Depot and Costco accounted for approximately 54% of\nour net sales in fiscal 2024. The market shares of many of these key retailers have increased and may continue to increase in future years.\nThe loss of, or significant adverse change in, our relationship with any of these key retailers could cause our net sales, operating income and cash flow to decline. The loss of, or reduction in, orders from any\nsignificant customer, losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce\nour operating income and cash flow.\nWe may be adversely affected by trends in the retail industry.\nOur retailer customers have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we depend for business. These key retailers are large and sophisticated with increased buying power and\nnegotiating strength. They are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing. Our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our key retailers, such as limitations on\naccess to shelf space, price demands and other conditions. In addition, large retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories. Consequently, our customers\nhave been implementing inventory destocking and making purchases on a “just-in-time” basis. This requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and to more closely anticipate demand, which\ncould in the future require the carrying of additional inventories and an increase in our working capital and related financing requirements. This shift to “just-in-time” can also cause retailers to delay purchase orders,\nwhich can cause a shift in sales from quarter to quarter. Decisions to move in or out of a market category by leading retailers can also have a significant impact on our business. Additionally, some retailers are\nincreasing their emphasis on private label products. These retailers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their store brand products. While we view private label as\nan opportunity and supply many private label products to retailers, we could lose sales if key retailers replace our branded products with private label product manufactured by others.\nWe sell our products through a variety of trade channels with a significant portion dependent upon key retailers, through both traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels and eCommerce channels, including\nAmazon. The eCommerce channel continues to grow rapidly. To the extent that the key retailers on which we depend lose share to the eCommerce channel, we could lose sales. We continue to make additional\ninvestments to access this channel more effectively, but there can be no assurances that any such investments will be successful. If we are not successful in developing and utilizing eCommerce channels that\nconsumers may prefer, we may experience lower than expected revenues.\nA significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of our major customers or several smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and cash flow. We continually\nmonitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a bankruptcy filing or liquidation by a key customer could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nIf we underestimate or overestimate demand for our products and do not maintain appropriate inventory levels, our results of operations and financial condition\ncould be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customers’ demand for our products is important for our business. Our production levels and inventory management goals for our products are based on\nestimates of demand, taking into account production capacity, timing of shipments, and inventory levels. If we overestimate or underestimate demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not\nmaintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales, profit margins, net earnings, and/or working capital, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, result in loss of customers, or\ncause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges.\nSupply disruptions in pet birds, small animals and fish may negatively impact our sales.\nThe federal government and many state governments have increased restrictions on the importation of pet birds and the supply of small animals. These restrictions have resulted in reduced availability of new\npet birds and small animals and thus reduced demand for pet\nbird and small animal food and supplies. If these restrictions become more severe, or similar restrictions become applicable to pet fish, our future sales of these products would likely suffer, which would negatively\nimpact our profitability. In addition, some countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu. A significant outbreak in the United States would reduce demand for our pet and wild bird food and negatively impact our\nfinancial results.\nOur Segrest subsidiary is the largest supplier of aquarium fish in the United States and also supplies pet birds and small animals. The sale of fish, pet birds and small animals subjects us to additional risk,\nincluding risks associated with sourcing, developing captive breeding programs, health of the fish, pet birds and small animals supplied by us and future governmental regulation of the sale of fish, pet birds and\nsmall animals.\nIssues with products may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, regulatory actions\nby governmental authorities that could divert resources, affect business operations, decrease sales, increase costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage,\nany of which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues with products that may lead to product liability, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities.\nProduct recalls or other governmental regulatory action directed at product sales could result in increased governmental scrutiny, reputational harm, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased\nwillingness by retailer customers to purchase or provide marketing support for those products, unavailability or increased cost of insurance, or additional safety and testing requirements. Such results could divert\ndevelopment and management resources, adversely affect our business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers\nnot affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, increase our profitability or maintain relationships with existing\ncustomers.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, which have experienced increased consolidation in recent years. We compete against numerous other companies, some of which are more established in their\nindustries and have substantially greater revenue and resources than we do. Our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our largest\ncompetitors in the Pet segment are Spectrum Brands, Mars, Inc. and the J.M Smucker Co., and our largest competitors in the Garden segment are Scotts Miracle-Gro, Spectrum Brands and S.C. Johnson.\nTo compete effectively, among other things, we must:\n• develop and grow brands with leading market positions;\n• maintain or grow market share;\n• maintain and expand our relationships with key retailers;\n• effectively access the growing eCommerce channel;\n• continually develop innovative new products that appeal to consumers;\n• implement effective marketing and sales promotion programs;\n• maintain strict quality standards;\n• deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices; and\n• effectively integrate acquired businesses.\nOur inability to compete effectively could lead to lower sales volumes, price reductions, reduced profits, losses, or loss of market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe continue to implement enterprise resource planning information technology systems.\nWe are incurring costs associated with designing and implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) software systems with the objective of gradually migrating our businesses to one or the other of two\nsystems. The choice of which is to be used for each business is dependent on the needs of the business unit. These two systems are replacing numerous accounting and financial reporting systems, most of which\nhave been obtained in connection with business acquisitions. To date, we have reduced the number of ERP systems from 47 to 11.\nCapital expenditures for our enterprise resource planning software systems for fiscal 2025 and beyond will depend upon the pace of conversion for those remaining legacy systems. If the balance of the\nimplementation is not executed successfully, we could experience business interruptions or material weaknesses relating to IT controls of acquired companies. For example, in fiscal 2023 we identified two material\nweaknesses related to our Live Plants and Green Garden businesses whose IT systems had not been fully integrated into our corporate IT control structure. The material weaknesses were resolved during fiscal\n2024, but there is no assurance that we may not experience similar IT control issues in the future. If we do not complete the implementation of the project timely and successfully, we may experience, among other\nthings, additional costs associated with completing this project and a delay in our ability to improve existing operations, support future growth and take advantage of new applications and technologies. All of this\nmay also result in distraction of management, diverting their attention from our operations and strategy.\nSome of the products that we manufacture and distribute require governmental permits and also subject us to potential environmental liabilities.\nSome of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal, state, foreign and local authorities. Environmental health and safety laws and regulations are often complex and are\nsubject to change. Environmental health and safety laws and regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacture, sale or use of our products or regulating their disposal. Regulatory or legislative changes may\ncause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations. There is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such laws or regulations, incur increased operating costs in\ncomplying with such regulations or not be subject to claims for personal injury, property damages or governmental enforcement. In addition, due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of\nenvironmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital expenditures will not be required.\nIn addition to operational standards, environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not\nactually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or\nif the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. With our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution\nfacilities, and most of these facilities have not been subjected to Phase II environmental tests to determine whether they are contaminated. Given the nature of the past operations conducted by us and others at\nthese properties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been\nconducted. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to future remediation liabilities that may be material.\nDeterioration in operating results could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness or impact our ability to refinance our debt\non favorable terms as it matures.\nWe have, and we will continue to have, significant indebtedness. As of September 28, 2024, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1.2 billion. This level of indebtedness and our future borrowing needs\ncould have material adverse consequences for our business, including:\n• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the terms of our indebtedness;\n• require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions and other business activities;\n• increase our vulnerability to adverse industry conditions, including unfavorable weather conditions or commodity price increases;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and\n• limit our ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable rates, if at all.\nIn addition, since our credit facility bears interest at variable rates, a further increase in interest rates or interest rate margins as defined under our credit agreement will create higher debt service requirements,\nwhich would adversely affect our cash flow.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions\nOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.\nWe are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with other companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material or could involve businesses\nwith operating characteristics that differ from our existing business operations, may become available in the near future. If and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available, we intend to actively\npursue them. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n• failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, as well as the potential impairment of the acquired assets if operating results decline after acquisition;\n• diversion of management’s attention;\n• additional financing, if necessary and available, which could increase leverage and costs, dilute equity, or both;\n• the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles;\n• difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of acquired companies;\n• initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n• the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire after the acquisition;\n• the high cost and expenses of identifying, negotiating and completing acquisitions; and\n• risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit our ability to make acquisitions and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We cannot assure you\nthat we will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs, delays or other\noperational or financial difficulties. In future acquisitions, we also could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be\nsignificant.\nA significant portion of our long-term assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but\nrather review them for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We consider whether circumstances or conditions\nexist which suggest that the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets might be impaired. If such circumstances or conditions exist, further steps are required to determine whether the\ncarrying value of each of the individual assets exceeds its fair value. If analysis indicates that an individual asset’s carrying value does exceed its fair value, we would record a loss equal to the excess of the\nindividual asset’s carrying value over its fair value.\nThe steps required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity. Events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that there may be an\nimpairment and that interim impairment testing is necessary include, but are not limited to: competitive conditions; the impact of the economic environment on our customer base and on broad market conditions that\ndrive valuation considerations by market participants; our internal expectations with regard to future revenue growth and the assumptions we make when performing impairment reviews; a significant decrease in\nthe market value of our assets; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which our assets are used; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect our assets; and significant\nchanges in the cash flows associated with an asset. As a result of such circumstances, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any\nimpairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets is determined. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and\nestimates of market growth or decline for future years. In fiscal 2024, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $12.8 million, and in fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment charges of\napproximately $7.5 million and $3.9 million in our Pet and Garden segments. There was no impairment loss recorded in fiscal 2022.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, in fiscal 2024 we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our\nreporting segments under the goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting\nsegments were greater than their carrying amount in fiscal 2024, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required in fiscal 2024. In connection with the our annual goodwill impairment testing performed\nduring fiscal 2023, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We completed our quantitative assessment of potential goodwill\nand determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting segments were greater than their carrying amounts. In connection with the our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during\nfiscal 2022, we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting segments under the goodwill impairment\ntest. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting segments were greater than their carrying amount in\nfiscal 2022, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required in fiscal 2022.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2023 and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future\nor otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements or otherwise adversely affect the accuracy,\nreliability or timeliness of our financial statements.\nAs described under Item 9A. \"Controls and Procedures\" below, we concluded that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of September 30, 2023 and, accordingly, our\ninternal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over\nfinancial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of\nits evaluation, management identified two material weaknesses: (1) in information technology general computer controls (\"ITGCs\") relating to access and program change management controls and (2) controls\nrelating to an outsourced service provider at two acquired businesses whose IT systems had not yet been fully integrated with our corporate IT control structure.\nManagement established a remediation plan that involved implementing additional controls to ensure that access and program change management controls are designed and operating effectively and that we\nhave effective controls relating to outsourced service providers and the data they provide. The remediation plan was implemented and tested during fiscal 2024 and deemed effective. However, we cannot provide\nassurance that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial\nreports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, these material weaknesses and any future\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability and timeliness of our financial statements and have other consequences that could materially and\nadversely affect our business.\nGeneral Risks\nOur success depends upon our retaining and recruiting key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of our senior management team. The loss of the services of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our\nformer Chief Executive Officer resigned in October 2023, and our Chief Financial Officer was promoted to Chief Executive Officer in September 2024 and the former chief financial officer of our Pet segment was\npromoted to our Chief Financial Officer. Our future performance depends on the success of our recently promoted Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and our ability to attract and retain skilled\nemployees in all facets of our business, including management and manufacturing and distribution. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees\nin the future.\nA significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cyber attack or data breach, could disrupt our operations and adversely impact\nour operating results, cash flows and reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and\nother hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.\nNumerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the\nconfidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. In addition, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to\ndetect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack.\nOur and our third-party providers’ IT systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of\nservice attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyberattacks. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches,\noperational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers’ IT systems.\nA breach of our data security systems or failure of our IT systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely\nupon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of,\nor loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, including personally identifiable information, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer\ninterruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. If our critical IT systems or back-up\nsystems or those of our third-party vendors are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. These risks can be magnified in companies that we\nhave acquired until we fully integrate their critical IT systems into our internal controls.\nIn addition, if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, either internally or at our third-party technology service providers, we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems, which\nmay cause interruptions or delays in our business operations, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation. In addition, such events could result in\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information or stakeholder information, including personally identifiable information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated\ninformation belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers and suppliers. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory\nenforcement actions; and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our suppliers, customers or employees and significant remediation costs.\nThe costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to protect our trademarks and any other proprietary rights may have a significant, negative impact on our business.\nWe consider our trademarks to be of significant importance in our business. Although we devote resources to the prosecution, protection and enforcement of our trademarks, we cannot assure you that the\nactions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others or prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as an alleged\ninfringement of their trademarks and proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that future litigation will not be necessary to enforce our trademarks or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claimed\ninfringement of the rights of others. Any future litigation of this type could result in adverse determinations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our\ninability to use our trademarks and other proprietary rights could also harm our business and sales through reduced demand for our products and reduced revenues.\nThe products that we manufacture and distribute could expose us to product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. Although we generally seek to insure against such risks, there can be no assurance that\ncoverage will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us\nand could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe have unresolved litigation which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are a party to litigation alleging that the applicator developed and used by us for certain of our branded topical flea and tick products infringes a patent held by Nite Glow Industries, Inc. and asserting claims\nfor breach of contract and misappropriation of confidential information. On June 27, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Nite Glow on each of the three claims and awarded damages of approximately $12.6\nmillion, which was reduced to $12.4 million. We filed our notice of appeal and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. On July 14, 2021, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the Company did not infringe\nplaintiff's patent and determined that the breach of contract claim raised no non-duplicative damages and should be dismissed. The court affirmed the jury's liability verdict on the misappropriation of confidential\ninformation claim but ordered a new trial on damages on that single claim limited to the \"head start\" benefit, if any, generated by the confidential information. The retrial of the “head start” damages issue concluded\nin March 2024, but no decision has been issued by the Court. We intend to vigorously pursue our defenses in any future proceedings and believe that we will prevail on the merits as to the head start damages\nissue. While we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and the final resolution of this matter may result in expense to us in excess of management's expectations.\nThe adoption of new tax legislation, unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash\nflows.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to\nour operating structure, changes in the mix of business operations and earnings, changes in tax laws and statutory tax rates, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process.\nFrom time to time, tax proposals are introduced or considered by the U.S. Congress or the legislative bodies in local and state jurisdictions that could also affect our tax rate or our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are\nalso affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. In connection with these\naudits (or future audits), tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, inter-company transfer pricing methodology or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely\noutcomes of our audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. As a result, the ultimate resolution of our tax audits and changes in tax laws or tax rates could materially affect our tax provision,\nnet income and cash flows in future periods.\nRisks Relating to our Capital Stock\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock and currently do not intend to do so. Provisions of our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes\nrestrict our ability to pay cash dividends. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to limitations under applicable law and contractual restrictions, and\nwill depend upon our results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or Class A common stock that could dilute the value and market price of our stock.\nWe may decide or be required to issue, including upon the exercise of any outstanding stock options, or in connection with any acquisition made by us, additional shares of our common stock or Class A\ncommon stock that could dilute the value of our common stock or Class A common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or Class A common stock.\nOur Chairman and founder, through his holdings of our Class B common stock, exercises effective control of the Company, which may discourage potential\nacquisitions of our business and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or 49% of the total votes cast, and each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into one share of our\ncommon stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned. Holders of our Class A common stock have no voting rights, except as required by Delaware law.\nAs of September 28, 2024, William E. Brown, our Chairman and founder, beneficially controlled approximately 55% of the voting power of our capital stock. Accordingly, except to the extent that a class vote of\nthe common stock is required by applicable law or our charter, he can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors, and can exert substantial control over our\nmanagement and policies. The disproportionate voting rights of our Class B common stock and Mr. Brown’s substantial holdings of Class B common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our\ncommon stock and Class A common stock. Also, such disproportionate voting rights and Mr. Brown’s controlling interest may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be, or render\nmore difficult or discourage a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such actions were favored by our other stockholders, which could thereby deprive holders of common stock or Class A common\nstock of an opportunity to sell their shares for a “take-over” premium.\nWe have authorized the issuance of shares of common stock, Class A common stock and preferred stock, which may discourage potential acquisitions of our\nbusiness and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our Class A common stock.\nPursuant to our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 80,000,000 shares of our common stock, 100,000,000 shares of our nonvoting\nClass A common stock, 3,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock and up to 1,000,000 additional shares of preferred stock without seeking the approval or consent of our stockholders, unless required by the\nNASDAQ Global Market. Although the issuance of the additional shares of nonvoting Class A common stock would not dilute\nthe voting rights of the existing stockholders, it would have a dilutive effect on the economic interest of currently outstanding shares of common stock and Class B common stock similar to the dilutive effect of\nsubsequent issuances of ordinary common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could, depending on the rights and privileges designated by the board with respect to any particular series, have a dilutive effect on\nthe voting interests of the common stock and Class B common stock and the economic interests of our common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In addition, the disproportionate voting\nrights of our Class B common stock, and the ability of the board to issue stock to persons aligned with current management, may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be or render\nmore difficult or discourage a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders, which could thereby deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity\nto sell their shares for a “take-over” premium.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy:\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among\nother things, operational risks; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees, customers or consumers; violation of data privacy or data security laws and other litigation and legal risk; and\nreputational risks.\nWe also maintain an incident response plan to coordinate the activities we take to protect against, detect, respond to and remediate cybersecurity incidents, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation\nS-K, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate risk, including reputational damage.\nWe have implemented several cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our efforts to identify, assess, and manage material risks, as well as to test and improve our incident response plan.\nOur approach includes, among other things:\n• conducting regular network and endpoint monitoring, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to improve our information systems, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K;\n• running tabletop exercises to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident and use the findings to improve our processes and technologies;\n• regular, mandatory cybersecurity training programs for relevant employees;\n• comparing our processes to standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”);\n• leveraging the ISO information security incident management model to help us identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover when there is an actual or potential cybersecurity incident;\n• leveraging third-party threat intelligence services designed to model and research our adversaries;\n• closely monitoring emerging data protection laws and implementing changes to our processes designed to comply;\n• periodically reviewing our consumer facing policies and statements related to cybersecurity;\n• conducting regular phishing email simulations for relevant employees and all contractors with access to corporate email systems to enhance awareness and responsiveness to such possible threats;\n• through policy, practice and contract (as applicable) requiring employees, as well as third parties who provide services on our behalf, to treat customer information and data with care; and\n• carrying information security risk insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident.\nThese approaches vary in maturity across the business and we work to continually improve them.\nOur process for identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats operates alongside our broader overall risk assessment process, covering all company risks. As part of this process\nappropriate disclosure personnel will collaborate with subject matter specialists, as necessary, to gather insights for identifying and assessing material cybersecurity threat risks, their severity, and potential\nmitigations.\nAs part of the above approach and processes, we periodically engage with assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third-parties, for purposes of evaluating our cybersecurity posture and identifying areas\nfor continued focus, improvement and/or compliance.\nWe describe how risks associated with a potential cybersecurity incident are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business, results of operations and financial condition, under the heading “A\nsignificant information security or operational technology\n12\nincident, including a cyberattack or a data breach, could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and reputation,” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosures are incorporated by reference herein.\nIn the last three fiscal years, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents and the expenses we have incurred from cybersecurity incidents were immaterial. This includes penalties and\nsettlements, of which there were none.\nCybersecurity Governance:\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of increasing focus for our Board and management.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. At least annually, the Audit Committee receives an overview from management of our\ncybersecurity threat risk management, including topics such as data security posture, results from third-party assessments, and material cybersecurity threat risks or incidents and developments, as well as the\nsteps management has taken to respond to such risks. In such sessions, the Audit Committee generally receives materials indicating current and emerging material cybersecurity threat risks, and describing the\ncompany’s ability to mitigate those risks, and discusses such matters with our Information Security Leadership Team, comprised of Chris Walter, our Chief Information Officer, Frank Madigan, our Vice President,\nInformation Technology and Security and Kelvin James, our Senior Manager, Information Security (the “InfoSec Leadership Team”).\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, which are discussed in greater detail above, are led by our InfoSec Leadership Team. The executives on this team have collectively over 60 years\nof prior work experience in the management of information security, developing cybersecurity strategy and implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs. In addition to their work experience, Mr.\nMadigan has a Master of Business Administration in Information Technology Management and Mr. James has a Master of Science in Information Security and Assurance.\nThe InfoSec Leadership Team is informed about and monitors the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the\ncybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan. If a cybersecurity incident is determined to be a material cybersecurity incident, our\nincident response plan and cybersecurity disclosure controls and procedures define the process to disclose such material cybersecurity incident.\nAs discussed above, the InfoSec Leadership Team reports about cybersecurity threat risks, among other cybersecurity related matters, to senior management and the Audit Committee, which provides\nupdates to the full Board of Directors.\nItem 2. Properties\nWe currently operate 40 manufacturing facilities totaling approximately 6.4 million square feet and 57 sales and distribution facilities totaling approximately 5.9 million square feet. Most sales and distribution\ncenters consist of office and warehouse space, and several large bays for loading and unloading. Each sales and distribution center provides warehouse, distribution, sales and support functions for its geographic\narea. Our executive offices are located in Walnut Creek, California.\nIn addition to the manufacturing and sales and distribution facilities, the Garden segment leases approximately 245 acres of land in Oregon, New Jersey and Virginia used in its grass seed and live plant\noperations and owns approximately 2,402 acres of land in Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, Ohio, New Jersey and Kentucky used in its live plant operations. The Pet segment leases approximately 80 acres of\nland in Florida to support its live fish operations.\nWe continually review the number, location and size of our manufacturing and sales and logistics facilities and expect to make changes over time to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprints. We\nlease 17 of our manufacturing facilities and 45 of our sales and logistics facilities. These leases generally expire between fiscal years 2024 and 2034. Substantially all of the leases contain renewal provisions with\nautomatic rent escalation clauses. The facilities we own are subject to major encumbrances under our principal credit facility. In addition to the facilities that are owned, our fixed assets are comprised primarily of\nmachinery and equipment, trucks and warehousing, transportation and computer equipment.\n13\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nIn 2012, Nite Glow Industries, Inc. and its owner, Marni Markell, (\"Nite Glow\") filed suit in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against the Company alleging that the applicator developed and used by the\nCompany for certain of its branded topical flea and tick products infringes a patent held by Nite Glow and asserted related claims for breach of contract and misappropriation of confidential information based on the\nterms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement. On June 27, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Nite Glow on each of the three claims and awarded damages of approximately $12.6 million. The court ruled on post-trial\nmotions in early June 2020, reducing the judgment amount to $12.4 million and denying the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees. The Company filed its notice of appeal and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. On July 14,\n2021, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision on the appeal. The Federal Circuit concluded that the Company did not infringe plaintiff's patent and determined that the breach of contract claim raised\nno non-duplicative damages and should be dismissed. The court affirmed the jury's liability verdict on the misappropriation of confidential information claim but ordered a new trial on damages on that single claim\nlimited to the \"head start\" benefit, if any, generated by the confidential information. The retrial on the \"head start\" damages issue concluded in early March 2024, but no decision has been issued by the court. The\nCompany intends to vigorously pursue its defenses in any future proceedings and believes that it will prevail on the merits as to the head start damages issue. While the Company believes that the ultimate\nresolution of this matter will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and the final resolution of this matter may result in\nexpense to the Company in excess of management's expectations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, we are not currently a party to any other legal proceedings that management\nbelieves could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n14\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol CENT, and our Class A common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol CENTA. Our Class B stock is not\nlisted on any market and generally cannot be transferred unless converted to common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nAs of November 15, 2024, there were 60 holders of record of our common stock, 367 holders of record of our Class A nonvoting common stock and three holders of record of our Class B stock.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the percentage change of our cumulative total stockholder return on our Common Stock (“CENT”) for the period from September 29, 2018 to September 28, 2024 with the\ncumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite (U.S.) Index and the Dow Jones Non-Durable Household Products Index, a peer group index consisting of approximately 30 manufacturers and distributors of\nhousehold products.\nThe comparisons in the graph below are based on historical data and are not indicative of, or intended to forecast, the possible future performance of our Common Stock.\nTotal Return Analysis\n9/28/2019 9/26/2020 9/25/2021 9/24/2022 9/30/2023 9/28/2024\nCentral Garden & Pet Company $ 100.00 $ 127.75 $ 157.72 $ 127.21 $ 149.17 $ 158.25\nNASDAQ Composite $ 100.00 $ 138.88 $ 192.89 $ 140.41 $ 172.35 $ 238.13\nDow Jones US Nondurable Household Products $ 100.00 $ 115.15 $ 119.69 $ 114.80 $ 127.19 $ 159.31\n15\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nThe following table sets forth the repurchases of any equity securities during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 and the dollar amount of authorized share repurchases remaining\nunder our stock repurchase programs.\nMaximum Number\n(or Approximate\nTotal Number of Dollar Value) of\nShares (or Units) Shares (or Units)\nTotal Number Average Purchased as that May Yet Be\nof Shares Price Paid Part of Publicly Purchased Under\n(or Units) per Share Announced Plans the Plans or\nPeriod Purchased (or Unit) or Programs Programs (1) (2)\nJune 30, 2024 – August 3, 2024 32,942 (2) (3) $ 31.85 29,019 $ 81,951,000\nAugust 4, 2024 – August 31, 2024 9,758 (2) (3) $ 32.53 3,100 81,951,000\nSeptember 1, 2024 – September 28, 2024 258,293 (2) (3) $ 32.63 257,590 81,951,000\nTotal 300,993 $ 32.55 289,709 $ 81,951,000 (4)\n(1) In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization”). The 2019 Repurchase Authorization\nhas no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. The repurchase of shares may be limited by certain financial covenants in our credit\nfacility that restrict our ability to repurchase our stock. As of September 28, 2024, we had $82.0 million of authorization remaining under our 2019 Repurchase Authorization. From September 29, 2024 through\nNovember 21, 2024, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our non-voting common stock (CENTA) and 0.4 million shares of our voting common stock (CENT) on the open market at an aggregate cost of\n$51.7 million. As of November 21, 2024, we had $30.3 million remaining under our 2019 Repurchase Authorization.\n(2) In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized us to make supplemental stock purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under our equity compensation plans (the “Equity Dilution\nAuthorization”). In addition to our regular share repurchase program, we are permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock and stock options granted in the\nprior fiscal year, to the extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization.\n(3) Shares purchased during the period indicated represent withholding of a portion of shares to cover taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock and do not reduce the dollar value of shares that may be\npurchased under our stock repurchase plan.\n(4) Excludes 38 thousand shares remaining under our Equity Dilution Authorization as of September 28, 2024.\n16\nItem 6. Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management’s discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results\nmay differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A – Risk Factors.”\nBusiness Overview\nCentral Garden & Pet Company is a leading manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets in the United States.\nIn fiscal 2024, our consolidated net sales were $3.2 billion, of which our Pet segment, or Pet, accounted for approximately $1.8 billion and our Garden segment, or Garden, accounted for approximately\n$1.4 billion. In fiscal 2024, our operating income was $185 million, consisting of income from our Pet segment of $203 million, income from our Garden segment of $82 million and corporate expenses of $100 million.\nFiscal 2024 Financial Highlights\nFinancial summary:\n• Net sales for fiscal 2024 decreased $109.6 million, or 3.3%, to $3.2 billion. Organic net sales decreased 3.9% with Pet organic sales decreasing 5.9% and Garden organic sales decreasing 1.2%.\n• Gross profit for fiscal 2024 declined $3.1 million, or 0.3%, to $943.7 million while gross margin increased 90 basis points in fiscal 2024 to 29.5%, from 28.6% in fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP basis,\ngross margin increased 110 basis points in fiscal 2024.\n• Our operating income declined $25.3 million, or 12.0%, to $185.4 million in fiscal 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income declined $4.4 million in fiscal 2024.\n• Net income for fiscal 2024 was $108.0 million, or $1.62 per share on a diluted basis compared to $125.6 million, or $1.88 per share on a diluted basis in fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, net income\nin fiscal 2024 was $142.4 million, or $2.13 per share on a diluted basis compared to $138.5 million, or $2.07 per share on a diluted basis in fiscal 2023.\nRecent Developments:\nCost and Simplicity program - Facility Closures and Business Exit\nThe following activities reflect our ongoing network optimization initiative to achieve a simpler, more efficient manufacturing and distribution network.\nIn our Pet segment, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, as part of our Cost and Simplicity program we decided to close a manufacturing facility in California, which we plan to exit in June 2025, and a\nfacility in Arizona, which we plan to exit in January 2025. The associated pet bed, outdoor cushion and durable pet supply manufacturing and distribution activities will be transitioned to Central facilities in Indiana\nand North Carolina. As a result, we incurred approximately $7.5 million of one-time costs, including $5.2 million in cost of goods sold and $2.3 million in selling, general and administrative costs, comprised of\ncharges for facility closures, the impairment of inventory and severance, the majority of which were non-cash. Additionally, related to the pet supplies business activities being transitioned, we recognized a non-cash\nimpairment charge of $12.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due primarily to changing market conditions resulting from the decline in demand for durable products and increased international\ncompetition.\nIn our Garden segment, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $3.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to facility closures and business\nexits announced in fiscal 2023 and earlier in fiscal 2024.\n17\nIn our Garden segment, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, as part of our Cost and Simplicity program and in response to changing market conditions, we decided to exit the pottery business which we\nexpect to be completed by calendar year-end 2025. Additionally, we closed a live goods distribution facility in Delaware and relocated our grass seed research facility from Oregon to Texas. As a result, in fiscal\n2024 we incurred approximately $10.9 million of one-time costs, including $8.6 million in cost of goods sold and $2.3 million in selling, general and administrative costs, comprised of charges for the impairment of\ninventory and facility closures, the majority of which were non-cash.\nIn our Garden segment, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, as part of our Cost and Simplicity program we decided to close a manufacturing facility in California. Additionally, in the second quarter,\nwe began the Southeast consolidation of four distribution locations into one new modern facility, which we expect to be completed by calendar year-end. As a result, we incurred approximately $5.3 million of one-\ntime costs, including $2.5 million in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million in selling, general and administrative costs, comprised of charges for facility closures, severance, and impairment of inventory, the majority of\nwhich were non-cash.\nLitigation Settlement Gain and Investment Impairment\nWithin corporate, we recognized a gain of $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, for the settlement of litigation, which is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Additionally, we\nrecognized a $7.5 million non-cash impairment charge for two related private company investments that is included within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\nStock Dividend\nIn December 2023, our Board of Directors approved a stock dividend in the form of one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock for every four outstanding shares of its Common Stock, Class A\nCommon Stock and Class B Stock, which shares were distributed on February 8, 2024, to stockholders of record as of January 8, 2024.\nThe stock dividend did not affect the number of the Company's authorized shares and the par value of each share of stock remained unchanged. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share\nexercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and performance share units outstanding at January 8, 2024, which resulted in a proportional\nincrease in the vesting of such stock options, restricted stock and performance share units, and, in the case of stock options, a proportional decrease in the exercise price of all such stock options.\nUnless noted, all Class A Common share and per share amounts contained in this Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-four stock dividend.\nFiscal 2024 Acquisition\nIn November 2023, we acquired TDBBS, LLC (“TDBBS”), a provider of premium natural dog chews and treats for approximately $60 million. The addition of TDBBS expands our portfolio with bully and collagen\nsticks, bones and jerky, adds scale to our dog and cat business and enhances our eCommerce and direct-to-consumer capabilities.\nFiscal 2025 Stock Repurchases\nSince our fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 through November 21, 2024, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our non-voting common stock (CENTA) and 0.4 million shares of our voting common stock\n(CENT) on the open market at an aggregate cost of $51.7 million. As of November 21, 2024, we had $30.3 million remaining under our 2019 Repurchase Authorization.\n18\nResults of Operations (GAAP)\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 24, 2022\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold and occupancy 70.5 71.4 70.3\nGross profit 29.5 28.6 29.7\nSelling, general and administrative 23.7 22.2 21.9\nOperating income 5.8 6.4 7.8\nInterest expense, net (1.2) (1.5) (1.7)\nOther expense, net (0.2) — (0.1)\nIncome taxes 1.0 1.1 1.4\nNet income 3.4 % 3.8 % 4.6 %\nFiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023\nNet Sales\nNet sales for fiscal 2024 decreased $109.6 million, or 3.3%, to $3,200.5 million from $3,310.1 million in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 included 52 weeks while fiscal 2023 included 53 weeks. Our branded product\nsales, which include products we produce under Central brand names and products we produce under third-party brands, decreased $80.2 million, and sales of other manufacturers’ products decreased $29.4\nmillion. Sales of branded products represented approximately 78% of our net sales in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and sales of other manufacturers' products represented 22% of our net sales.\nOrganic net sales, which exclude net sales from the acquisition of TDBBS in November 2023 and net sales from the independent garden channel distribution business we sold in the prior fiscal year, declined\n$127.9 million, or 3.9%, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decline in organic net sales was due primarily to lower Pet sales.\nThe following table indicates each class of similar products which represented approximately 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal years presented:\nCategory 2024 2023 2022\n(in millions)\nOther garden products $ 802.6 $ 832.2 $ 865.3\nOther pet products 701.4 699.4 765.9\nOther manufacturers' products 735.9 734.9 730.2\nDog & cat products 534.2 568.6 542.9\nWild bird 426.4 475.0 434.3\nTotal $ 3,200.5 $ 3,310.1 $ 3,338.6\nPet net sales decreased $44.4 million, or 2.4%, to $1,832.8 million in fiscal 2024 from $1,877.2 million in fiscal 2023. Pet organic sales, which exclude net sales from the acquisition of TDBBS in November\n2023, declined $110.8 million. Fiscal 2023 included an extra week compared to fiscal 2024. The decline in Pet net sales was volume-related and due primarily to lower demand for durable pet products, particularly\nin our outdoor cushion business, aquatics business, and pet bed business. These declines were partially offset by increased sales in our animal health business. Pet branded sales decreased $45.4 million, and\nsales of other manufacturers' products increased $1.0 million.\nGarden net sales decreased $65.2 million, or 4.5%, to $1,367.7 million in fiscal 2024 from $1,432.9 million in fiscal 2023. Garden organic sales, which exclude net sales from the independent garden channel\ndistribution business sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, decreased $17.1 million, or 1.2%. The Garden net sales decline was volume related and due primarily to lower sales in wild bird feed partially offset by\nincreased sales in our controls and grass seed businesses. Additionally, fiscal 2023 included an extra week compared to fiscal 2024. Garden branded sales decreased $34.8 million, and sales of other\nmanufacturers' products decreased $30.4 million.\n19\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2024 decreased $3.1 million, or 0.3%, to $943.7 million from $946.8 million in fiscal 2023. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to 29.5% in fiscal 2024 from 28.6% in fiscal 2023. The\ndecline in gross profit resulted from decreased Garden gross profit, partially offset by an increase in Pet. The improved gross margin was due primarily to the higher gross margin in Pet partially offset by a lower\ngross margin in Garden. Both segments were adversely impacted by fiscal 2024 facility closure projects under our Cost and Simplicity initiative.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the charges associated with the facility closures in fiscal 2024, gross profit increased $3.5 million and gross margin improved 110 basis points to 30.0% in fiscal 2024. These\nincreases were due primarily to the benefits resulting from Central's Cost and Simplicity program and lower inflation.\nBoth Pet and Garden benefitted from the results of the Cost and Simplicity program and lower inflation. The increase in the Pet gross margin was partially offset by a lower gross margin, as compared to the\nprior fiscal year. The decrease in Garden was due primarily to an approximately $19 million write-down of the value of our grass seed inventory due to a recent significant decrease in the market prices of grass seed\nand what we believe to be an industry-wide over supply of grass seed and lower sell through in our Live Goods business.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million, or 3.0%, from $736.2 million in fiscal 2023 to $758.3 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative\nexpenses increased from 22.2% in fiscal 2023 to 23.7% in fiscal 2024. The increase was due to $21.1 million in expense related to the closure of facilities in both the Pet and Garden segments and intangible asset\nimpairments, partially offset by the gain from a litigation settlement. Excluding these items and similar items in fiscal 2023, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense increased $7.9 million and\nincreased as a percentage of net sales to 23.0% in fiscal 2024 compared from 22.0% in fiscal year 2023.\nSelling and delivery expense increased $2.3 million, or 0.7%, to $339.8 million in fiscal 2024 and increased as a percentage of net sales from 10.2% in fiscal 2023 to 10.6% in fiscal 2024. The increase in\nselling and delivery expense was in the Pet segment due primarily to our acquisition of TDBBS in November 2023.\nWarehouse and administrative expense increased $19.8 million, or 5.0%, to $418.5 million in fiscal 2024 and increased as a percentage of net sales from 12.0% in fiscal 2023 to 13.1% in fiscal 2024. The\nincrease in warehouse and administrative expense was due to increases in both the Pet and the Garden segments, partially offset by lower corporate expense. The increases in both the Pet and Garden segments\nwere due primarily to the charges related to the closure of facilities, the exit of the pottery business and the impairment of intangible assets. Excluding these expense items, warehouse and administrative expense\nincreased $8.9 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, due primarily to the acquisition of TDBBS in November 2023.\nCorporate expense decreased due primarily to lower equity compensation and the gain from a litigation settlement. Corporate expenses included within administrative expense relate to the costs of unallocated\nexecutive, administrative, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology functions.\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased $25.2 million, or 12.0%, to $185.4 million in fiscal 2024 from $210.6 million in fiscal 2023. Our operating margin was 5.8% in fiscal 2024, decreasing from 6.4% in fiscal 2023.\nDecreased sales of $109.6 million and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a 90 basis point increase in gross margin, contributed to the lower operating income. The increased\nselling, general administrative expenses were due primarily to facility closures and intangible asset impairments. Excluding the impact of these costs, on a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 7.0% in fiscal\n2024 compared to 6.9% in fiscal 2023.\nPet operating income increased $5.4 million, or 2.7%, to $203.4 million in fiscal 2024 from $198.0 million in fiscal 2023, due to an improved gross margin partially offset by lower net sales and increased selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses. Pet operating margin increased from 10.5% in fiscal 2023 to 11.1% in fiscal 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, Pet operating income increased $7.3 million in fiscal 2024 as\ncompared to fiscal 2023 and operating margin improved to 12.2% in fiscal 2024 from 11.5% in fiscal 2023.\nGarden operating income decreased $41.6 million, or 33.7%, to $81.9 million in fiscal 2024 from $123.5 million in fiscal 2023, due to lower sales, a lower gross margin, and higher selling, general and\nadministrative expenses. Both gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses were impacted by charges related to the closure of facilities and the planned exit of the pottery business. On a non-\nGAAP basis that excludes the impact of these charges in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, Garden non-GAAP operating income declined $19.4 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 and non-GAAP\noperating margin declined to 7.5% in fiscal 2024 from 8.5% in fiscal 2023 due primarily to a write-down of the value of our grass seed inventory due to a recent significant decrease in the market prices for grass\nseed and what we believe to be an industry-wide over supply of grass seed and lower sell through in our Live Plants business.\nCorporate expenses decreased $10.9 million due primarily to lower equity compensation and the gain from a litigation settlement.\n20\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense decreased $11.8 million, or 23.7%, from $49.7 million in fiscal 2023 to $37.9 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease in net interest expense was due to increased interest income due primarily\nto higher cash balances during fiscal 2024.\nDebt outstanding on September 28, 2024 was $1,190.0 million compared to $1,188.2 million as of September 30, 2023. Our average borrowing rate was 4.5% in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) is comprised of income or loss from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was\nan expense of $5.1 million in fiscal 2024 compared to income of $1.5 million in fiscal 2023, due primarily to a $7.5 million impairment in fiscal 2024 for two private company investments.\nIncome Tax\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.2% for fiscal 2024 compared to 22.4% for fiscal 2023. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the blended state income tax rate in\nfiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nOur net income for fiscal 2024 was $108.0 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $125.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, for fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in fiscal 2024 was\n$142.4 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, compared to $138.5 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, for fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nFor a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP net\nincome and diluted net income per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted EBITDA and organic net sales.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between\ncurrent results and results in prior operating periods. While Management believes that non-GAAP measures are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP\nfinancial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense (or operating income plus\ndepreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). Adjusted EBITDA further excludes one-time charges related to facility closures exits of business, intangible and investment\nimpairments and gains from a litigation settlement. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our\nbusiness and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors,\nsecurities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently\nand it may not be comparable.\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below.\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\n• Facility closures and business exit: we have excluded charges related to the closure of distribution and manufacturing facilities and our decision to exit the pottery business as they represent infrequent\ntransactions that impact the comparability between operating periods. We believe these exclusions supplement the GAAP information with a measure that may be useful to investors in assessing the\nsustainability of our operating performance.\n21\n• Asset impairment charges: we exclude the impact of asset impairments on intangible assets and investments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency. We believe that the\nadjustment of these charges supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n• Gain from litigation settlement: we exclude the gain from a litigation settlement as it is a one-time occurrence. We believe that the exclusion of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a\nmeasure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n• Gain on sale of a business or service line: we exclude the impact of the gain on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the\ncomparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the performance of our ongoing\noperations.\n• Tax impact: adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated\nbased on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment.\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\nFacility closures and business exits\n(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $7.5 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of manufacturing facilities in\nCalifornia and Arizona. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to facility closures and business exits announced in fiscal 2023 and earlier in fiscal\n2024.\n(2) During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $11.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations, from the decision to exit the pottery business, the closure of a live\ngoods distribution facility in Delaware and the relocation of our grass seed research facility.\n(3) During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $5.3 million in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing facility in California and the\nconsolidation of our Southeast distribution network.\n(4) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a gain of $5.8 million from the sale of our independent garden center distribution business, which includes the impact of associated facility closure\ncosts. The gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\n(5) In fiscal 2023, we recognized incremental expense of $13.9 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas.\nAdditionally, we recognized incremental expense of $1.8 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of a second manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas.\nIntangible Impairments\n(6) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $12.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due primarily to changing market\nconditions resulting from the decline in demand for durable products and increased international competition.\n(7) In fiscal 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $2.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets caused by the loss of a significant customer in our live fish\nbusiness. Also, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due to reduced demand for products we sold under an\nacquired trade name. The impairments were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative costs.\nGain from litigation and investment impairment\n(8) Within corporate, the Company received $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 in settlement of litigation which gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Additionally, we\nrecognized a $7.5 million non-cash impairment charge for two related private company investments that is included within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\n22\nNet Income and Diluted Net Income Per Share Reconciliation GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\n(in thousands, except per share

costs, interest rates, consumer attitudes toward discretionary spending, currency fluctuations, and\nother macro-economic factors which may impact levels of consumer spending. In fiscal years 2021 through 2023, we were adversely impacted by high input costs due to inflation, particularly relating to prices for\ngrain and seed, fuel and the ingredients used in our garden controls and fertilizer business as well as heightened import costs such as shipping container costs and tariffs. In fiscal 2022, our gross and operating\nmargins increased as we were able to sufficiently increase prices and volumes to offset higher input costs. Costs continued rise in fiscal 2023, however, and we were unable to continue to increase prices and our\ngross and operating margins were negatively impacted. Inflation began to moderate in late fiscal year 2023 and continued to moderate in fiscal 2024, and we were able to benefit from lower cost inventory and\nsignificant productivity gains resulting in improved margins.\nIn fiscal 2022, we experienced increasing inflationary pressure, including notable increases in costs for key commodities, materials, labor and freight. During fiscal 2023, we continued to experience inflationary\npressures, although at a reduced rate in the latter months of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2024, we experienced moderating inflation.\n25\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur sales of lawn and garden products are influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve. Our Garden segment’s business is highly seasonal. In fiscal 2024, approximately\n66% of our Garden segment’s net sales and 59% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment’s operating income is typically generated in this\nperiod.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our growth through a combination of internally generated funds, bank borrowings, supplier credit, and sales of equity and debt securities to the public.\nOur business is seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern. Generally, during the first fiscal quarter, accounts receivable reach their lowest level\nwhile inventory, accounts payable and short-term borrowings begin to increase. During the second fiscal quarter, receivables, accounts payable and short-term borrowings increase, reflecting the build-up of\ninventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season. During the third fiscal quarter, inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short-term\nborrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season. During the fourth fiscal quarter, inventory levels are at their lowest, and accounts receivable and payables are\nsubstantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash.\nWe service two broad markets: pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies. Our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year-round selling cycle with a slight degree of seasonality. As a result, it is\nnot necessary to maintain large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands. Our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately 66% of our Garden segment’s net sales occurring during the\nsecond and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality requires the shipment of large quantities of product well ahead of the peak consumer buying periods. To encourage retailers and distributors to stock large\nquantities of inventory, industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and/or promotional discounts.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $13.3 million, from $381.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $394.9 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working\ncapital accounts, due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a lower amount of cash generated from the decrease in accounts receivable, as compared to the prior year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $415.6 million, from $34.0 million of cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2022 to $381.6 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023.\nThe increase in cash provided was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts, primarily a decrease in inventory, due to our focus on converting inventory to cash, and in accounts receivable.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $70.6 million from $34.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $105.2 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to our acquisition\nof TDBBS, LLC.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $108.4 million from $143.0 million in fiscal 2022 to $34.6 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to reduced\ncapital expenditures, decreased investments in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and proceeds received from the sale of our independent garden center distribution business.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $12.1 million from $37.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $25.4 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the current year was due\nprimarily to lower stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $29.2 million from $66.8 million of cash used in fiscal 2022 to $37.6 million of cash used in fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during\nthe current year was due primarily to lower stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nWe expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations, proceeds from our debt and equity offerings, and, if necessary, borrowings under our $750 million asset backed loan\nfacility. See Note11 - Long-Term Debt, for more information about our debt. Based on our anticipated cash needs, availability under our asset backed loan facility and the scheduled maturity of our debt, we believe\nthat our sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet our working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond. However, we cannot assure you that these sources\nwill continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity and, should we require it, that we will be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\n26\nWe anticipate that our capital expenditures, which are related primarily to replacements and expansion of and upgrades to plant and equipment and also investment in our continued implementation of a\nscalable enterprise-wide information technology platform, will be approximately $70 million over the next 12 months.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired a large number of businesses in the past, and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates in the future. If one or more\npotential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, become available in the near future, we may require additional external capital. In addition, such acquisitions would subject us to the\ngeneral risks associated with acquiring companies, particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.3 million shares of our non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $10.7 million and approximately\n3 thousand shares of our voting common stock (CENT) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $109 thousand. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of our non-\nvoting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $22.9 million and approximately 0.3 million shares of our voting common stock (CENT) on the open market at an aggregate\ncost of approximately $8.7 million.\nIn August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization\"). The 2019 Repurchase Authorization\nhas no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 28, 2024, we had $82 million remaining under our 2019 Repurchase\nAuthorization.\nIn February 2019, the Board of Directors authorized us to make supplemental purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under our equity compensation plans (the \"Equity Dilution Authorization\").\nIn addition to our regular share repurchase program, we are permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or stock options granted in the prior fiscal year, to\nthe extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 28, 2024, the\nCompany had authorization remaining to repurchase up to 38 thousand shares under its Equity Dilution Authorization.\nDuring the period September 29, 2024 through November 21, 2024, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our non-voting common stock (CENTA) and 0.4 million shares of our voting common stock (CENT) on\nthe open market at an aggregate cost of $51.7 million. As of November 21, 2024, we had $30.3 million remaining on under our 2019 Repurchase Authorization.\nTotal Debt\nAt September 28, 2024, our total debt outstanding was $1,190.0 million versus $1,188.2 million at September 30, 2023.\nSenior Notes\n$400 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2031\nIn April 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding\nborrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $6 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this issuance, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are\nbeing amortized over the term of the 2031 Notes.\nThe 2031 Notes require semi-annual interest payments on April 30 and October 30. The 2031 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted\nsubsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our Amended Credit Facility. The 2031 Notes were issued in a private placement under Rule 144A and will not be registered under the Securities Act of\n1933.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to April 30, 2026, at the principal amount plus a \"make whole\" premium. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2031\nNotes at its option, at any time on or after April 30, 2026 for 102.063%, on or after April 30, 2027 for 101.375%, on or after April 30, 2028 for 100.688% and on or after April 30, 2029 for 100.0%, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest.\nThe holders of the 2031 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2031 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control.\nThe 2031 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all\nfinancial covenants as of September 28, 2024.\n27\n$500 million 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030\nIn October 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding\n6.125% senior notes due November 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\") at a redemption price of 101.531% plus accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder used for general\ncorporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $8.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs are\nbeing amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes.\nThe 2030 Notes require semiannual interest payments on October 15 and April 15. The 2030 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted\nsubsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our Credit Facility.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes at any time, at our option, prior to October 15, 2025, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a “make-whole” premium. We may redeem some or all\nof the 2030 Notes, at our option at any time on or after October 15, 2025 for 102.063%, on or after October 15, 2026 for 101.375%, on or after October 15, 2027 for 100.688% and on or after October 15, 2028 for\n100.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe holders of the 2030 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued\nand unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe 2030 Notes contain customary high yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all\nfinancial covenants as of September 28, 2024.\n$300 Million 5.125% Senior Notes due 2028\nIn December 2017, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). We used the net proceeds from the offering to finance acquisitions and for\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nWe incurred approximately $4.8 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included underwriter fees and legal, accounting and rating agency expenses. The debt issuance costs\nare being amortized over the term of the 2028 Notes.\nThe 2028 Notes require semiannual interest payments on February 1 and August 1. The 2028 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries\nwho are borrowers under or guarantors of our Credit Facility.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes, at our option, at any time before December 31, 2024 for 101.708%, on or after January 1, 2025 for 100.854% and on or after January 1, 2026 for 100.0%, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest.\nThe holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued\nand unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe 2028 Notes contain customary high-yield covenants, including covenants limiting debt incurrence and restricted payments, subject to certain baskets and exceptions. We were in compliance with all\nfinancial covenants as of September 28, 2024.\nAsset-Based Loan Facility\nOn December 16, 2021, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $750 million principal amount senior secured asset-based\nrevolving credit facility, with up to an additional $400 million principal amount available with the consent of the Lenders, as defined, if we exercise the uncommitted accordion feature set forth therein (collectively, the\n“Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility matures on December 16, 2026. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the\nCredit Facility must be repaid in full.\nThe Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated using a formula based upon eligible receivables and inventory, and at our election, eligible real property, minus certain reserves. Proceeds of\nthe Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Net availability under the Credit Facility was approximately $481 million as of September 28, 2024. The Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit\nfor the issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit and a $75 million sublimit for Swing Loan borrowings. As of September 28, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding and no letters of credit\noutstanding under the Credit Facility. Outside of the Credit Facility, there were other letters of credit of $3.0 million outstanding as of September 28, 2024.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at an index based on SOFR (which will not be less than 0.00%) or, at our option, the Base Rate, plus, in either case, an applicable margin based on our\nusage under the Credit Facility. Base Rate is defined as the highest of (a) the Truist prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month SOFR plus 1.00% and (d) 0.00%. The applicable margin for\nSOFR-based borrowings fluctuates between1.00%-1.50%, and was 1.0% as of September 28, 2024, and the applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings fluctuates between 0.00%-0.50%, and was 0.00% as of\nSeptember 28, 2024. An unused line fee shall be payable quarterly in respect of the total amount of the unutilized Lenders’ commitments under the Credit Facility. Standby letter of credit fees accruing at the\n28\napplicable margin on the average undrawn and unreimbursed amounts of standby letters of credit are payable quarterly, and a facing fee of 0.125% is payable quarterly for the stated amount of each letter of credit.\nWe are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Credit Facility. As of September 28, 2024, the applicable interest rate related to Base Rate borrowings was 8.0%, and the applicable\ninterest rate related to one-month SOFR-based borrowings was 5.8%.\nWe incurred approximately $2.4 million of debt issuance costs in conjunction with this transaction, which included lender fees and legal expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of\nthe Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility continues to contain customary covenants, including financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 upon triggered quarterly testing (e.g.\nwhen availability falls below certain thresholds established in the agreement), reporting requirements and events of default. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the borrowing parties, including\n(i) pledges of 100% of the stock or other equity interest of each domestic subsidiary that is directly owned by such entity and (ii) 65% of the stock or other equity interest of each foreign subsidiary that is directly\nowned by such entity, in each case subject to customary exceptions. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024.\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities\nCentral (the \"Parent/Issuer\") issued $400 million of 2031 Notes in April 2021, $500 million of 2030 Notes in October 2020, and $300 million of 2028 Notes in December 2017. The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and\n2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (the \"Guarantors\") which are guarantors of our Credit\nFacility. The 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2028 Notes are unsecured senior obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt, including our Amended Credit Facility, to the extent of the\nvalue of the collateral securing such indebtedness. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to make distributions to the Parent/Issuer. Certain subsidiaries and operating divisions of the\nCompany do not guarantee the 2031, 2030 or 2028 Notes and are referred to as the Non-Guarantors.\nThe Guarantors jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantee the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes when due, whether at stated\nmaturity of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes and to the trustee under the\nindenture governing the 2031, 2030 and 2028 Notes (the \"Guarantee\"). The Guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and are of equal rank with all other existing and future senior\nindebtedness of the Guarantors.\nThe obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and to any collections from or\npayments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under the guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under Federal or state law.\nThe Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:\n(1) upon any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), in accordance with the governing indentures, to any person other\nthan the Company;\n(2) if such Guarantor merges with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger;\n(3) if such Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; or\n(4) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option or the discharge of the Company's obligations under the indentures in accordance with the terms of the indentures.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent/Issuer subsidiaries and the Guarantor subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries under\nParent/Issuer and subsidiaries under the Guarantor have been eliminated. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the\nsummarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Parent/Issuer's interests in the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized information excludes financial information of the\nNon-Guarantors, including earnings from and investments in these entities.\n29\nSummarized Statements of Operations\n(in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\n(in thousands)\nParent/Issuer Guarantors Parent/Issuer Guarantors\nNet sales $ 694,083 $ 2,491,748 $ 768,207 $ 2,531,503\nGross profit 154,310 771,737 166,370 767,480\nIncome (loss) from operations (6,164) 189,406 (32,001) 244,164\nEquity in earnings of Guarantor subsidiaries 163,797 — 191,793 —\nNet income (loss) (58,047) 163,797 (63,840) 191,793\nSummarized Balance Sheet Information\n(in thousands) As of As of\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\n(in thousands)\nParent/Issuer Guarantors Parent/Issuer Guarantors\nCurrent assets $ 936,497 $ 896,476 $ 661,660 $ 999,218\nIntercompany receivable from Non-guarantor subsidiaries 76,084 — 69,404 —\nOther assets 3,799,521 3,330,344 3,402,000 2,762,797\nTotal assets $ 4,812,102 $ 4,226,820 $ 4,133,064 $ 3,762,015\nCurrent liabilities $ 164,607 $ 342,289 $ 155,793 $ 294,686\nIntercompany payable from Non-guarantor subsidiaries — 1,003 — 766\nLong-term debt 1,189,655 154 1,187,771 186\nOther liabilities 1,888,312 234,308 1,308,736 60,611\nTotal liabilities $ 3,242,574 $ 577,754 $ 2,652,300 $ 356,249\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year:\nFiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal\nContractual Obligations 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total\n(in millions)\nLong-term debt, including current\nmaturities (1) $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ — $ 1,200.0 $ 1,200.5\nInterest payment obligations (2) 52.5 52.5 52.5 44.8 37.1 43.3 282.7\nOperating leases 65.0 53.7 42.6 30.8 24.7 55.6 272.4\nPurchase commitments (3) 102.1 14.5 8.5 6.0 2.1 2.4 135.6\nPerformance-based payments (4) — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 219.8 $ 120.8 $ 103.7 $ 81.7 $ 63.9 $ 1,301.3 $ 1,891.2\n(1) Excludes $3.0 million of outstanding letters of credit related to normal business transactions.

The terms of these contracts vary; some having fixed prices or quantities, others having variable pricing and quantities. For certain agreements,\n30\nmanagement estimates are used to develop the quantities and pricing for anticipated purchases, and future purchases could vary significantly from such estimates.\n(4) Possible performance-based payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses are not included in the above table, because they are based on future performance of the businesses acquired, which is\nnot yet known. Performance-based payments of approximately $0.1 million were made in fiscal 2024 related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. Potential performance-based periods extend through fiscal 2025 for\nHydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc. and the payments are capped at $1.0 million per year.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are required for, among other items, accounts receivable and inventory realizable values, fixed asset lives, long-lived asset valuation and impairments,\nintangible asset lives, stock-based compensation, deferred and current income taxes, self-insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAlthough not all inclusive, we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable\nintangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization\nbut must be evaluated for impairment.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually (as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting\nunit below its carrying amount, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment\nevaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments and historical performance. If it is determined that it is more likely\nthan not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. Based on certain circumstances, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment\nand proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying values, including goodwill. Impairment is indicated\nif the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. Our goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the\naggregate estimated fair value of our two reporting segments to the Company’s total market capitalization.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting segment involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of our reporting segments is based on our projection of revenues,\ngross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We\nbase our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were: (i) discount\nrates used in determining the fair value of the reporting segments; (ii) estimated future cash flows; and (iii) projected revenue and operating profit growth rates used in the reporting segment models. Actual results\nmay differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors.\nOur goodwill is associated with our Pet segment and our Garden segment. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2024, we made a qualitative evaluation about the\nlikelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting segments under the goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of\npotential goodwill impairment and determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting segments were greater than their carrying amount in fiscal year 2024, and accordingly, no further testing\nof goodwill was required in fiscal 2024.\n31\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2023, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing the quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test. We completed our quantitative assessment of potential goodwill and determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of our reporting segments were greater than their carrying amounts.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal year 2022, we made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary\nto calculate the fair values of our reporting segments under the goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and determined that it was more likely than not\nthe fair values of our reporting segments were greater than their carrying amount in fiscal year 2022, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required in fiscal year 2022.\nChanges in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rates, could result in a significantly different estimate of\nthe fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in additional impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances\noccur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life if its carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include\nsignificant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Future net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for trade\nnames based on management’s forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes and general economic factors such as consumer\nspending.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and market\ngrowth or decline estimates for future years. We recognized impairment losses on certain intangible assets of $12.8 million and $11.5 million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and there were no\nimpairment losses recorded in fiscal year 2022.\nAcquisitions\nIn connection with businesses we acquire, management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such\namounts, particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets, and the applicable useful lives related thereto. Under different assumptions, the resulting valuations could be materially different, which could\nmaterially impact the operating results we report.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including contingent consideration, as well as any\nnoncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair\nvalues of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.\nSeveral valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of\nfuture cash flows attributable to the asset is discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the\namount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to Note 3 -\nAcquisitions and Investments in Joint Ventures, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisitions.\nOur contractual commitments are presented under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, which include changes in U.S. interest rates and commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or\nspeculative purposes.\n32\nInterest Rate Risk. The interest payable on our Amended Credit Facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates. We had no variable rate debt outstanding\nas of September 28, 2024 under our Credit Facility. However, if our Credit Facility were fully drawn and interest rates changed by 25 basis points compared to actual rates, interest expense would have increased or\ndecreased by approximately $1.9 million. In addition, we have investments consisting of cash equivalents and short-term investments, which are also affected by changes in market interest rates.\nCommodity Prices. We are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for grains, grass seed, chemicals, fertilizer ingredients and pet treat ingredients. To mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices\nand commodity availability, we enter into contracts for purchases, primarily to ensure commodity availability to us in the future. As of September 28, 2024, we had entered into fixed purchase commitments for\ncommodities totaling approximately $135.6 million. A 10% change in the market price for these commodities would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of $13.6 million as the related inventory\ncontaining those inputs is sold.\nForeign Currency Risks. Our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not material. To date, we have had minimal sales outside of the United States. Purchases made by our U.S. subsidiaries from\nforeign vendors are primarily made in U.S. dollars. Our international subsidiary transacts most of its business in British pounds and Canadian dollars. Therefore, we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency\nexchange risk. We do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial to our current business.\n33\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee pages beginning at F-1.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have reviewed, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that ensure that information relating to the Company required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported in a timely and proper manner and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this review, such officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024.\nRemediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weaknesses\nWe previously identified and disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as well as in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed for the quarters ended December 30, 2023, March\n30, 2024, and June 29, 2024, material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. The material weaknesses identified related to (1) certain information technology general computer controls\n(\"ITGC’s\") at our Live Plant and Green Garden businesses and (2) controls related to an outsourced service provider that supports certain of the Company’s revenue processes for our Live Plant business. As a\nresult, certain of the Company’s related business controls that are dependent upon the affected ITGC’s and lack of controls around outsourced IT service provider data were also deemed ineffective. A “material\nweakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in annual or interim financial statements\nwill not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of September 28, 2024, we have completed our remediation activities including testing of the design and concluding on the operating effectiveness of the related controls. The remediation activities\nincluded, but are not limited to:\n• Instituted a ITGC material weakness remediation team;\n• Implemented defined standards & control processes;\n• Enhanced the training of personnel on the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting;\n• Developed monitoring controls and protocols allowing us to timely assess the design and operating effectiveness of the new and redesigned controls;\n• Hired an additional resource with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience; and\n• Expanded and formalized controls related to recording revenue from an outsourced service provider that supports certain of the Company's revenue processes for our Live Plant business.\nBased upon the above, we believe the steps taken have improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we have determined that these new or redesigned controls are operating\neffectively.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that other than the improvements to our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses discussed\nabove, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n34\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA copy of our management’s report and the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, are included in our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data beginning on\npage F-1.\nItem 9B.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of Central’s internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission. The scope of management's assessment of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting included all of our consolidated operations except for the operations of TDBBS, LLC, which we acquired in November 2023 and whose financial\nstatements constitute 1% and 2% of the consolidated total assets and net sales, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC's general\nguidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition. Based upon this assessment, such officers concluded the Company maintained effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which appears on page F-5 of this Form 10-K.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may\nbecome ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nF-2\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Central Garden & Pet Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central Garden & Pet Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023, and September 24, 2022, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023, and September 24, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 27, 2024,\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are\nfree of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nNet Sales - Revenue Recognition for Consignment Arrangements — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nUnder consignment arrangements, a component of the Garden segment net sales, the customer receives the product at its retail locations, but the Company retains the title to the product until it is purchased by the\nretail consumer. When products are sold under consignment arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue when control over such products has transferred to the retail consumer. The initiation, processing, and\nrecording of certain transactions under a specific consignment arrangement with a retailer customer relies upon the accuracy and completeness of revenues reported by its customer and revenue transaction\nprocessing services provided by a third party.\nWe identified revenue recognition for this consignment arrangement included in net sales for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, to be a critical audit matter because of the nature of the information used by\nthe Company to recognize revenue. This required a high degree of audit judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of information reported by the Company’s customer\nand third-party transaction processing services provider.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to revenue recognized for this consignment arrangement included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over recognizing consignment revenue.\nF-3\n• With the assistance of data specialists, we created data visualizations to analyze journal entries to (i) identify significant transaction types in the revenue population and (ii) evaluate trends in the transactional\nrevenue data, significant transaction types, and related accounts affecting revenue.\n• For a sample of transactions, we performed a test of details on those related accounts determined to have a significant relationship with revenue, including accounts receivable and cash collections.\n• We traced the recording of point-of-sale revenue transactions into the Company’s records to test how revenue transactions are captured, processed, and aggregated.\n• We performed a proof of cash reconciliation that reconciled cash deposits to revenue recognized throughout the year. For a selection of deposits received during the period, we performed detailed transaction\ntesting, including agreeing the amount of the deposit received and the amount recognized as revenue during the period to underlying source documents, including cash receipts.\n• We selected a sample of credits issued after the end of the fiscal year and performed detailed transaction testing by agreeing the credit amount to documents supporting the authorization of the issuance of\nthe credit and to evaluate if the credit was recognized in the correct period.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nNovember 27, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since at least 1987; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.\nF-4\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Central Garden & Pet Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Central Garden & Pet Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control\nover financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 28, 2024, of the Company and our report dated November 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired operations of TDBBS,\nLLC, which was acquired on November 3, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute 1% and 2% of the consolidated total assets and net sales, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended September 28,\n2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at TDBBS, LLC.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nNovember 27, 2024\nF-5\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 28,

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended September 28, 2024,\nSeptember 30, 2023, and September 24, 2022\n1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization – Central Garden & Pet Company (“Central”), a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries (the “Company”), is a leading marketer and producer of quality branded products and distributor of third-\nparty products in the pet and lawn and garden supplies markets.\nBasis of Consolidation and Presentation – The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and include\nthe accounts of Central and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 included 52 weeks, the\nfiscal year ended September 30, 2023 included 53 weeks and the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 included 52 weeks.\nStock Dividend - In December 2023, the Board of Directors approved a stock dividend in the form of one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock for every four outstanding shares of its Common\nStock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Stock. Dividend shares of Class A Common Stock were distributed on February 8, 2024, to stockholders of record as of January 8, 2024.\nThe stock dividend did not affect the number of the Company's authorized shares and the par value of each share of stock remained unchanged. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share\nexercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and performance share units outstanding at January 8, 2024, which resulted in a proportional\nincrease in the number of vesting stock options, restricted stock and performance share units, and, in the case of stock options, a proportional decrease in the exercise price of all such stock options.\nUnless noted, all Class A Common Stock share and per share amounts contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis have been retroactively\nadjusted to reflect the one-for-four stock dividend. The legal form of the stock dividend was accounted for as a stock split as the Company concluded that shareholders were not receiving a distribution of earnings.\nNoncontrolling Interest – Noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated financial statements represents the 20% interest not owned by the Company in a consolidated subsidiary. Since the Company\ncontrols this subsidiary, its financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company, and the noncontrolling owner’s 20% share of the subsidiary’s net assets and results of operations is deducted and\nreported as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets and as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that management make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period including realization of accounts receivable and inventory and valuation of goodwill and intangibles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition and Nature of Products and Services\nThe Company manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded, private label and third-party pet and garden products to wholesalers, distributors and retailers, primarily in the United States.\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of finished pet and garden products. The Company also recognizes a minor amount of non-product revenue (approximately one percent of\nconsolidated net sales) comprising third-party logistics services, merchandising services and royalty income from sales-based licensing arrangements. Product and non-product revenue is recognized when\nperformance obligations under the terms of the contracts with customers are satisfied. The Company recognizes product revenue when control over the finished goods transfers to its customers, which generally\noccurs upon shipment to, or receipt at, customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract, and when control over the finished goods transfers to retail consumers in consignment\narrangements. These revenue arrangements generally have single performance obligations. Non-product revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer in the case of third-party logistics\nservices and merchandising services, or as third-party licensee sales occur for royalty income. Revenue, which includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of variable\nconsideration and consideration payable to our customers, including applicable discounts, returns, allowances, trade promotion, unsaleable product, consumer coupon redemption and rebates. The amount billed to\ncustomers for shipping and handling costs included in net sales for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was $12.8 million, $13.6 million and $15.8 million,\nrespectively. Shipping and handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed to be fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs.\nF-11\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nKey sales terms are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, the Company does not capitalize contract\ninception costs. The Company generally does not have unbilled receivables at the end of a period. Deferred revenues are not material and primarily include advance payments for services that have yet to be\nrendered. The Company does not receive noncash consideration for the sale of goods. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis;\ntherefore, the Company does not have any significant financing components.\nSales Incentives and Other Promotional Programs\nThe Company routinely offers sales incentives and discounts through various regional and national programs to its customers and consumers. These programs include product discounts or allowances, product\nrebates, product returns, one-time or ongoing trade-promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require the Company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs.\nThe costs associated with these activities are accounted for as reductions to the transaction price of the Company’s products and are, therefore, recorded as reductions to gross sales at the time of sale. The\nCompany bases its estimates of incentive costs on historical trend experience with similar programs, actual incentive terms per customer contractual obligations and expected levels of performance of trade\npromotions, utilizing customer and sales organization inputs. The Company maintains liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated incentive costs incurred but unpaid for these programs. Differences\nbetween estimated and actual incentive costs are generally not material and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Reserves for product returns, accrued rebates and promotional\naccruals are included in the consolidated balance sheets as part of accrued expenses, and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns is included within prepaid and other current assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nCost of goods sold consists of cost of product, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, certain indirect purchasing, merchandise handling and storage costs, internal transfer costs as well as\nallocations of overhead costs, including depreciation, related to the Company’s facilities. Cost of goods sold excludes substantially all shipping and handling and out-bound freight costs to customers, which are\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses as delivery expenses. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal costs and payments to third parties, included in delivery expenses within selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was $87.1 million, $97.1 million and $100.8 million, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs – The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expenses were $56.2 million, $43.6 million and $54.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n401(k) Plans – The Company sponsors several 401(k) plans which cover substantially all employees. The Company’s matching contributions expensed under these plans were $ 6.8 million for fiscal 2024, $7.9\nmillion for fiscal 2023 and $7.2 million for fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s matching contributions made in the Company’s Class A common stock resulted in the issuance of approximately\n198,697, 216,000 and 170,000 shares, respectively.\nOther income (expense) consists principally of earnings (losses) from equity method investments and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of “temporary differences” between asset and liability amounts for financial reporting purposes\nand such amounts as determined based on existing tax laws. Deferred income taxes result primarily from bad debt allowances, inventory and goodwill write-downs, amortization and depreciation. The Company\nestablishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of fiscal year-end 2024 and 2023, the Company had\nvaluation allowances related to various state and foreign net deferred tax assets of $9.9 million and $7.7 million, respectively.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash – The Company considers cash and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash and cash\nequivalents. Restricted cash includes cash and highly liquid instruments that are used as collateral for stand-alone letter of credit agreements related to normal business transactions. These agreements require the\nCompany to maintain specified amounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued thereunder, which will affect the amount of cash the Company has available for other uses.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the consolidated statements of cash flows as of\nF-12\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSeptember 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively (in thousands).\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 24, 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 753,550 $ 488,730 $ 177,442\nRestricted cash 14,853 14,143 14,742\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 768,403 $ 502,873 $ 192,184\nAccounts receivable are carried at their estimated net realizable value. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis; thus trade receivables do not bear interest, although a finance charge may be\napplied to such receivables that are past due.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Customer Allowances – The Company’s trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value, which includes an allowance for estimated credit losses, as well as\nallowances for contractual customer deductions accounted for as variable consideration.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses related to its trade accounts receivable for future expected credit losses for the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company\nestimates the allowance based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances and the customer’s financial condition. The allowance is adjusted to reflect changes in current and forecasted\nmacroeconomic conditions. The Company’s estimate of credit losses includes expected current and future economic and market conditions. See Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses and Customer Allowances.\nInventories which primarily consist of garden products and pet supplies finished goods, are stated at net realizable value. Cost includes certain indirect purchasing, merchandise handling and storage costs\nincurred to acquire or manufacture inventory, costs to unload, process and put away shipments received in order to prepare them to be picked for orders, and certain other overhead costs. The amount of such costs\ncapitalized to inventory is computed based on an estimate of costs related to the procurement and processing of inventory to prepare it for sale compared to total product purchases. See Note 6 – Inventories, net.\nLand, buildings, improvements and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over 30 years for buildings. Improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nshorter of the useful life of the asset or the terms of the related leases. Depreciation on equipment and capitalized software is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to 10\nyears. See Note 7 – Property and Equipment, Net.\nLong-Lived Assets – The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including amortizable and indefinite-lived intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, for potential impairment\nwhenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company’s fixed\nassets and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If an evaluation\nof recoverability is required, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset group would be compared to the asset group carrying amount to determine if a write-down is required. If the\nundiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded. Impairment, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nThe Company recognized impairment losses on certain intangible assets of $12.8 million and $11.5 million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and there were no impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2022.\nShould market conditions or the assumptions used by the Company in determining the fair value of assets change, or management changes plans regarding the future use of certain assets, additional charges to\noperations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur. See Note 9 – Other Intangible Assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable\nintangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment annually. The\nCompany tests for goodwill impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 8 –\nGoodwill.\nInvestments – The Company owns membership interests ranging from 1% to 50% in fourteen unconsolidated companies. The Company accounts for its interest in these entities using the equity method and\nin accordance with ASC 321 – Investments – Equity Securities. Equity method losses of $6.7 million (which includes an investment impairment of $7.5 million) in fiscal year 2024, equity method losses of $0.2 million\nin fiscal year 2023, and equity method income of $0.8 million in fiscal 2022, are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s investment in these entities was\n$31.5 million at September 28, 2024 and $38.7 million at September 30, 2023 and is included in Other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. On an individual and combined basis, the assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses of these entities are not significant. See Note 3 – Acquisitions.\nF-13\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nLeases -The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period\nof time in exchange for consideration and other facts and circumstances. Long-term operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and current and long-term operating lease liabilities are presented separately in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are presented in property, plant and equipment, net, and the related finance liabilities are presented with current and long-term debt in the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nLease ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU\nassets are calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments paid to the lessor at or before the commencement date and excludes any lease incentives received from the lessor. Lease\nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain\nthat the Company will exercise that option. As the Company's leases typically do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, the Company determines the present value of the lease liability using its incremental\nborrowing rate at the lease commencement date based on the lease term on a collateralized basis. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and include certain non-lease components, such as\nmaintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease, as applicable. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for as a single\nlease component, as the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets.\nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature\nof the leased item. Operating lease cost is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term with expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of\nthe leased item. All operating lease cash payments and lease costs on finance leases are recorded within cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within cash flows\nfrom financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 10 - Leases.\nInsurance – The Company maintains insurance for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability, and is self-insured for employee related health care benefits. The\nCompany’s workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability insurance policies include deductibles of $250,000 to $350,000 per occurrence. The Company maintains excess loss insurance that\ncovers any health care claims in excess of $750,000 per person per year. The Company establishes reserves for losses based on its claims experience and actuarial estimates of the ultimate loss amount inherent\nin the claims, including claims incurred but not yet reported. Costs are recognized in the period the claim is incurred, and the financial statement accruals include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable and payable, short term\nborrowings and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior subordinated notes is based on quoted market\nprices for these instruments. See Note 2 – Fair Value Measurements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.\nStock-Based Compensation – Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is expensed ratably over the service period of the award. Total\ncompensation costs recognized under all share-based arrangements in fiscal 2024 was $20.6 million ($15.7 million after tax), fiscal 2023 was $28.0 million ($21.3 million after tax), and fiscal 2022 was $25.8 million\n($19.7 million after tax). See Note 14 – Stock-Based Compensation for further information.\nTotal Comprehensive Income (Loss) – Total comprehensive income (loss) consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to gains\nand losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded directly as an element of shareholders’ equity, but are excluded from net income, and is comprised of currency translation adjustments\nrelating to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries in the U.K and Canada whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nF-14\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Updates\nThere are no recently adopted accounting pronouncements that had a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker that are included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, and also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to\nbe included in interim periods. ASU No. 2023-07 is to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company’s\ndisclosures.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU primarily requires enhanced disclosures and disaggregation of income\ntax information by jurisdiction in the annual income tax reconciliation and quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 is to be applied prospectively, with the option to\napply the standard retrospectively, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company’s\ndisclosures.\n2. Fair Value Measurements\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require financial assets and liabilities to be categorized based on the inputs used to calculate their fair values as follows:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including\nassumptions about risk).\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and equivalents, restricted cash and equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable and payable, derivative instruments, short-term borrowings,\nand accrued liabilities. The carrying amount of these instruments approximates fair value because of their short-term nature.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe fair values of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities from previous business acquisitions are considered \"Level 3\" measurements because the Company uses various estimates in the valuation\nmodels to project timing and amount of future contingent payments. The liability for contingent consideration relates to future performance-based contingent payments for Hydro-Organics Wholesale, Inc., acquired\nin October 2015. The performance period related to Hydro-Organics Wholesale extends through fiscal 2025. The fair value of the estimated contingent consideration arrangement is determined based on the\nCompany’s evaluation as to the probability and amount of any earn-out that will be achieved based on expected future performance by the acquired entity. The balance, if there is an amount, is presented as part of\nlong-term liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nF-15\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial instruments for the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nAmount\n(in thousands)\nBalance September 24, 2022 $ 543\nChanges in the fair value of contingent performance-based payments (374)\nPerformance-based payments made (54)\nBalance as of September 30, 2023 115\nChanges in the fair value of contingent performance-based payments (20)\nPerformance-based payments made (95)\nBalance as of September 28, 2024 $ —\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain non-financial assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets and right-of-use assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Fair value\nmeasurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities are used primarily in the impairment analyses of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result of market changes and declining\nsales, factors indicating the carrying value of certain amortizable and indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2024. The Company performed impairment testing on these\nassets, found the carrying value was not recoverable, and accordingly, recorded impairment charges of approximately $12.8 million in its Pet segment, as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. In fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, impairment charges of approximately $7.5 million and $3.9 million in the Company's\nPet and Garden segments, respectively, were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairment losses recorded in fiscal\n2022.\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\nIn April 2021, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due April 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). The estimated fair value of the Company's 2031 Notes as of September\n28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $367.2 million and $327.1 million compared to a carrying value of $396.0 million and $395.4 million, respectively.\nIn October 2020, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due October 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). The estimated fair value of the Company's 2030 Notes as of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $465.2 million and $417.0 million compared to a carrying value of $495.2 million and $494.4 million, respectively.\nIn December 2017, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). The estimated fair value of the Company's 2028 Notes as of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $299.2 million and $279.5 million, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $298.4 million and $298.0 million, respectively.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices for these notes, which are Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\n3. Acquisitions and Investments in Joint Ventures\nFiscal 2024\nOn November 3, 2023, the Company acquired TDBBS, LLC (“TDBBS”), a provider of premium natural dog chews and treats for approximately $ 60 million. The addition of TDBBS expands Central’s portfolio\nwith bully and collagen sticks, bones and jerky, adds scale to its dog and cat business and enhances Central’s eCommerce and direct-to-consumer capabilities. The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair\nvalue of the net tangible assets acquired by approximately $45 million, of which $23 million was allocated to identified intangible assets and approximately $5 million was included in goodwill in the Company's\nconsolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024. Financial results of TDBBS have been included in the results of operations within the Pet segment since the date of acquisition.

Associated with the sale,\nthe Company is closing one facility and part of another facility due to excess space previously dedicated to serving the independent garden channel. As a result of these closures, the Company recorded a gain of\n$5.8 million which is net of the inventory sold, inventory transport costs and the associated facility closure costs, including severance. The gain was recorded as part of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFiscal 2022\nThe Company did not make any acquisitions in fiscal 2022.\nDuring the second quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company finalized the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible assets, intangible assets and liabilities acquired for its\nacquisitions of Green Garden Products and D&D Commodities Limited, respectively.\nGreen Garden Products\nOn February 11, 2021, the Company acquired Flora Parent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"Green Garden Products\"), a leading provider of vegetable, herb and flower seed packets, seed starters and plant nutrients\nin North America, for approximately $571 million. The Company borrowed approximately $180 million under its credit facility to partially finance the acquisition. The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value\nof the net tangible assets acquired by approximately $487 million, of which $393 million was allocated to identified intangible assets and approximately $143 million was included in goodwill in the Company's\nconsolidated balance sheet as of September 24, 2022. The financial results of Green Garden Products have been included in the results of operations within the Garden segment since the date of acquisition.

(\"D&D\"), a provider of high-quality, premium bird feed, for approximately $ 88 million in cash and the assumption of approximately\n$30 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to the acquisition, $30 million of cash was used to eliminate the acquired long-term debt. The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets\nacquired by approximately $99 million, of which $64 million was allocated to identified intangible assets and approximately $34 million was included in goodwill in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 24, 2022.

During fiscal 2023, the Company converted a SAFE note totaling\n$0.9 million into shares, acquiring a 6% interest, which is accounted for in accordance with ASC 321. During fiscal 2022, the Company made investments totaling $26.1 million, maintaining its 7% interest in a\nventure and acquiring a 10% interest in another venture, both of which are accounted for in accordance with ASC 321.\nF-19\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n4. Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers\nCustomer Concentration – Approximately 54% of the Company’s net sales for fiscal 2024, 52% for fiscal 2023 and 51% for fiscal 2022 were derived from sales to the Company’s top five customers. The\nCompany’s largest customer accounted for approximately 17% of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2024, 16% in 2023 and 17% in 2022 (in both Pet and Garden). The Company’s second largest customer in 2024\naccounted for approximately 16% of the Company’s net sales in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in both Pet and Garden). The Company’s third largest customer in 2024 accounted for approximately 8% of the\nCompany’s net sales in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in Pet). The loss of, or significant adverse change in, the relationship between the Company and any of these three customers could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results. The loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer, losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise\ncondition or related matters, or the Company’s inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could also have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, accounts receivable from the Company’s top five customers comprised approximately 53% and 51%, respectively, of the Company’s total accounts receivable,\nincluding 14% and 11%, respectively, from the Company’s largest customer.\nSupplier Concentration – While the Company purchases products from many different manufacturers and suppliers, approximately 7%, 5% and 7% of the Company’s cost of goods sold in fiscal years 2024,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, were derived from products purchased from the Company’s five largest suppliers.\n5. Allowance for Credit Losses and Customer Allowances\nThe Company’s trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value, which includes an allowance for estimated credit losses, as well as allowances for contractual customer deductions accounted\nfor as variable consideration as described in Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses related to its trade accounts receivable for future expected credit losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The\nCompany estimates the allowance based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances and the customer’s financial condition. The allowance is adjusted to reflect differences in current conditions\nas well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions. The Company’s estimate of credit losses includes expected current and future economic and market conditions.\nThe following provides a reconciliation of the activity in the Allowance for Credit Losses and Customer Allowances:\nCharged/ Asset\nBalances at (Credited) to Write-Offs, Balances at\nBeginning Costs and Less End of\nof Period Expenses Recoveries Period\n(in thousands)\nFiscal Year Ended September 24, 2022 $ 29,219 $ 1,264 $ (4,237) $ 26,246\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 26,246 1,258 (1,707) 25,797\nFiscal Year Ended September 28, 2024 25,797 1,055 (5,817) 21,035\n6.

The\nF-21\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nqualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments and historical performance. If it is\ndetermined that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. Based on certain circumstances, the Company may\nelect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying values,\nincluding goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. The Company’s goodwill\nimpairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of its two reporting units to the Company’s total market capitalization.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The estimate of fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units is based on the Company’s\nprojection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and\noperational strategies. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions the Company believes to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Assumptions\ncritical to the Company’s fair value estimates were: (i) discount rates used in determining the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) estimated future cash flows; and (iii) projected revenue and operating profit growth\nrates used in the reporting unit models. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors.\nIn connection with the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2024, the Company made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether\nit was necessary to calculate the fair values of its reporting units under the goodwill impairment test. The Company completed its qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and determined that it was\nmore likely than not the fair values of the Company's reporting units were greater than their carrying amount in fiscal year 2024, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required in fiscal 2024.\nIn connection with the Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2023, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company completed its quantitative assessment of potential goodwill and determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of the Company's reporting units were\ngreater than their carrying amounts.\nIn connection with the the Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal year 2022, the Company made a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to\ndetermine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of its reporting segments under the goodwill impairment test. The Company completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment\nand determined that it was more likely than not the fair values of the Company’s reporting segments were greater than their carrying amount in fiscal year 2022, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was\nrequired in fiscal year 2022.\nF-22\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n9.

See Note 3 – Acquisitions.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, including amortizable and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. The Company evaluates indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis. As a result of market changes and declining sales, factors indicating the carrying value of certain amortizable and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2024 and 2023. The Company performed impairment testing on these assets, found the carrying value was not recoverable, and\naccordingly, recorded impairment charges of approximately $12.8 million in its Pet segment as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year\nended September 28, 2024 and $7.5 million and $3.9 million in its Pet and Garden segments, respectively, as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the\nfiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Factors indicating the carrying value of the Company's amortizable and indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable were not present in fiscal 2022, and\naccordingly, no impairment testing was performed on these assets.\nF-23\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from four years to 25 years; over weighted-average remaining lives of nine years for marketing-related\nintangibles, ten years for customer-related intangibles and seven years for other acquired intangibles. Amortization expense for intangibles subject to amortization was approximately $34.1 million, $34.5 million and\n$35.1 million, for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Annual amortization expense related to\nacquired intangible assets in each of the succeeding five years is estimated to be approximately $25 million per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2027, and $23 million per year from fiscal 2028 through fiscal\n2029.\nF-24\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n10.

The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024.\nThe scheduled principal repayments on long-term debt as of September 28, 2024 are as follows:\n(in thousands)\nFiscal year:\n2025 $ 239\n2026 62\n2027 57\n2028 35\n2029 —\nThereafter 1,200,000\nTotal $ 1,200,393 (1)\n(1) Debt repayments do not reflect the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs associated with the 2028 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes of approximately $ 10.3 million as of September 28, 2024, of which,\n$1.6 million is amortizable until February 2028, $4.8 million is amortizable until October 2030 and $4.0 million is amortizable until April 2031, and are included in the carrying value.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nLetters of credit – The Company had $3.0 million of outstanding letters of credit related to normal business transactions at September 28, 2024. These agreements require the Company to maintain specified\namounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued thereunder, which will affect the amount of cash the Company has available for other uses. The amount of cash collateral\nin these segregated accounts was $14.9 million and $14.1 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and is reflected in “Restricted cash” on the Company's consolidated balance\nsheets.\nPurchase commitments – Production and purchase agreements (primarily for grass seed and grains) entered into in the ordinary course of business may obligate the Company to make future purchases\nbased on estimated yields. The terms of these contracts vary; some have fixed prices or quantities while others have variable pricing and quantities. For certain agreements, management estimates are used to\ndevelop the quantities and pricing for anticipated purchases, and future purchases could vary significantly from such estimates.\nContingencies\nThe Company may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Currently, the Company is not a party to any legal proceedings the resolution of which\nmanagement believes could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations with the exception of the proceeding below.\nIn 2012, Nite Glow Industries, Inc and its owner, Marni Markell, (“Nite Glow”) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against the Company alleging that the applicator developed and used by the\nCompany for certain of its branded topical flea and tick products infringes a patent held by Nite Glow and asserted related claims for breach of contract and misappropriation of confidential information based on the\nterms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement. On June 27, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Nite Glow on each of the three claims and awarded damages of approximately $12.6 million. The court ruled on post-\ntrial motions in early June 2020, reducing the judgment amount to $12.4 million and denying the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees. The Company filed its notice of appeal and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. On\nJuly 14, 2021, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision on the appeal. The Federal Circuit concluded that the Company did not infringe plaintiff's patent and determined that the breach of contract\nclaim raised no non-duplicative damages and should be dismissed. The court affirmed the jury's liability verdict on the misappropriation of confidential information claim but ordered a new trial on damages on that\nsingle claim limited to the \"head start\" benefit, if any, generated by the confidential information. The retrial on the \"head start\" damages issue concluded in early March 2024, but no decision has been issued by the\ncourt. The Company intends to vigorously pursue its defenses in any future proceedings and believes that it will prevail on the merits as to the head start damages issue. While the Company believes that the\nultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial\nF-29\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nstatements, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and the final resolution of this matter may result in expense to the Company in excess of management's expectations.\nThe Company has experienced, and may in the future experience, issues with products that may lead to product liability, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental\nauthorities. The Company has not experienced recent issues with products, the resolution of which management believes would have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nF-30\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n13.

In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company\nconsiders all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation\nallowance against any deferred tax assets. The Company has determined there will be insufficient future separate state and foreign taxable income for the separate parent company and foreign subsidiaries to\nrealize the deferred tax assets. Therefore, valuation allowances of $9.9 million and $7.7 million (net of federal impact) at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, have been provided to reduce\nstate deferred tax assets to amounts considered recoverable.\nThe Company classifies uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters\nas a component of pretax income. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, accrued interest was less than $0.1 million and no penalties were accrued related to uncertain tax positions.\nF-32\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of September 24, 2022 $ 382\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 222\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 100\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (10)\nSettlements (222)\nDecreases related to lapse of statute of limitations (81)\nBalance as of September 30, 2023 $ 391\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 1\nIncreases related to current year tax positions —\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (12)\nSettlements (1)\nDecreases related to lapse of statute of limitations (84)\nBalance as of September 28, 2024 $ 295\nAs of September 28, 2024, unrecognized income tax benefits totaled approximately $0.3 million and all of the unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.\nThe Company is principally subject to taxation by the United States and various states within the United States. The Company’s tax filings in major jurisdictions are open to examination by tax authorities by the\nInternal Revenue Service from fiscal year ended 2021 forward and in various state taxing authorities generally from fiscal year ended 2020 forward.\nThe Company believes there is a reasonable chance that its unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by less than $0.1 million within the next twelve months.\n14. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s 2003 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2003 Plan”), as amended, allows for the grant of options, restricted stock and certain other specified types of awards to key employees, directors and\nconsultants of the Company. The 2003 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised only of independent directors, and which must approve individual awards\nto be granted, vesting and exercise of share conditions.\nThere are a total of 5.8 million shares of Common Stock, 19.7 million shares of Class A Common Stock and 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized under the 2003 Plan. If and when the Company\nissues any shares of Preferred Stock under the 2003 Plan, it will reduce the amount of Class A Common Stock available for future issuance in an amount equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock\nthat are issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock.\nThe Company has a Nonemployee Director Equity Incentive Plan (the “Director Plan”) which provides for the grant of options and restricted stock to nonemployee directors of the Company. The Director Plan,\nas amended, provides for the granting to each independent director a number of shares of restricted stock equal to $120,000 divided by such fair market value.\nAs of September 28, 2024, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock and no shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock reserved for outstanding equity awards, and there were\napproximately 4.6 million shares of Common Stock, 11.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock and 0.5 million shares of Preferred Stock remaining for future awards. In fiscal 2024, no shares were granted from\nthe Director Plan and each independent director was granted restricted shares from the 2003 Plan.\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $20.6 million, $28.0 million, and $25.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022,\nrespectively, as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 consisted of $0.7 million, $3.8 million, and $4.9 million, respectively,\nfor stock options, and $13.1 million, $16.3 million and $13.7 million, respectively, for stock awards. Share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 also includes $6.8 million, $7.9 million and $7.2\nmillion, respectively, for the Company’s 401(k) matching contributions.\nF-33\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nStock Option Awards\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company did not grant any stock options.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company granted time-based stock options with an exercise price 15% above the market price on the date of the grant. But generally, the Company has granted options at the market\nprice on the date of the grant.\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Expected stock price volatilities are estimated based on the historical volatility of the\nCompany’s stock price. The expected term of options granted is based on exercise behavior, option exercises and the contractual term of the option. The risk-free rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields, for notes\nwith comparable terms as the option grants, in effect at the time of the grant. For purposes of this valuation model, no dividends have been assumed.\nIn fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company’s calculations were made using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: expected life from the date of grant, 8\nyears in fiscal 2023 and 3.7 years in 2022; stock price volatility, 30.6% in fiscal 2023 and 31.1% in fiscal 2022; risk free interest rates, 3.6% in fiscal 2023 and 1.7% in fiscal 2022; and no dividends during the\nexpected term.\nThe following table summarizes option activity for the period ended September 28, 2024:\nNumber of Weighted Weighted Average Aggregate\nShares Average Exercise Remaining Intrinsic Value\n(in thousands) Price per Share Contractual Life (in thousands)\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 2,228 $ 26.53 3 years $ 30,229\nGranted — $ —\nExercised (1,136) $ 23.96\nCanceled or expired (264) $ 30.37\nOutstanding at September 28, 2024 828 $ 28.83 2 years $ 3,520\nExercisable at September 24, 2022 1,489 $ 25.50 3 years $ 5,826\nExercisable at September 30, 2023 1,613 $ 24.99 2 years $ 11,361\nExercisable at September 28, 2024 758 $ 28.25 2 years $ 3,518\nExpected to vest after September 28, 2024 70 $ 35.16 1 year $ 2\nThe prices of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock outstanding at September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were $ 20.63 to $41.10 per share, $20.63 to $41.10 per\nshare and $17.10 to $41.10 per share, respectively. There were no options granted in fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was $12.29 and $8.77, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and\nSeptember 24, 2022 was $12.0 million, $3.9 million, and $6.1 million, respectively.\nAs of September 28, 2024, there was $0.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting\nperiod of one year.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were approximately 1.4 million and 1.8 million shares, respectively, of restricted stock awards outstanding. Awards granted in fiscal 2024 and 2023\ngenerally vest within four or five years from the date of grant.\nF-34\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRestricted stock award activity during the period ended September 28, 2024 is summarized as follows:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nNumber of Fair Value per\nShares Share\n(in thousands)\nNonvested at September 30, 2023 1,848 $ 29.13\nGranted 332 $ 33.27\nVested (603) $ 26.87\nForfeited (179) $ 32.32\nNonvested at September 28, 2024 1,398 $ 30.68\nAs of September 28, 2024, there was $24.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\nthree years.\nIn fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted a combination of performance stock units (PSU’s) and restricted stock awards under its long-term incentive program, which replaced the option or\nrestricted stock awards historically granted annually under the Company’s long-term incentive plan. The impact of granting PSU’s during fiscal year 2024 was not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nPSU’s provide the right to receive shares of the Company’s common stock based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria at the end of a four-year measurement period (fiscal 2024-\nfiscal 2027) and continued employment through the vesting period. The number of shares issued at the end of the performance period may range from 50% to 225% of the original target award amount (100%).\n15. Shareholders’ Equity\nAt September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were 80,000,000 shares of common stock ($0.01 par value) authorized, of which 11,074,620 and 11,077,612, respectively, were outstanding, and\n100,000,000 shares of non-voting Class A common stock ($0.01 par value) authorized, of which 54,446,194 and 54,472,902, respectively, were outstanding. The preferences and relative rights of the Class A\ncommon stock are identical to common stock in all respects, except that the Class A common stock generally has no voting rights unless otherwise required by Delaware law.\nThere are 3,000,000 shares of Class B stock ($0.01 par value) authorized, of which 1,602,374 was outstanding at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The voting powers, preferences and relative\nrights of the Class B stock are identical to common stock in all respects except that (i) the holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and the holders of Class B stock are entitled to the lesser of ten\nvotes per share or 49% of the total votes cast, (ii) stock dividends on common stock may be paid only in shares of common stock and stock dividends on Class B stock may be paid only in shares of Class B stock\nand (iii) shares of Class B stock have certain conversion rights and are subject to certain restrictions on ownership and transfer. Each share of Class B stock is convertible into one share of common stock, at the\noption of the holder. Additional shares of Class B stock may only be issued with majority approval of the holders of the common stock and Class B stock, voting as separate classes.\nThere are 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock ($0.01 par value) authorized, of which none were outstanding at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nIn August 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $100 million of its common stock (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization\"). The 2019\nRepurchase Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the amount authorized has been used or the Board withdraws its authorization. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $82.0 million\nremaining under its 2019 Repurchase Authorization. During fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 0.3 million shares of its non-voting common stock (CENTA) on the open market at an aggregate\ncost of approximately $10.7 million and approximately 3 thousand shares of its voting common stock (CENT) on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately $ 109 thousand.\nIn February 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to make supplemental purchases to minimize dilution resulting from issuances under its equity compensation plans (the \"Equity Dilution\nAuthorization\"). In addition to the Company's regular share repurchase program, it is permitted to purchase annually a number of shares equal to the number of shares of restricted stock or stock options granted in\nthe prior fiscal year, to the extent not already repurchased, and the current fiscal year. The Equity Dilution Authorization has no fixed expiration date and expires when the Board withdraws its authorization. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024, the Company had authorization remaining to repurchase up to 38 thousand shares under its Equity Dilution Authorization.\nF-35\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n16. Earnings Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) computations:\nFiscal Year Ended September 28, 2024 Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2022\nNet Per Net Per Net Per\nIncome Shares Share Income Shares Share Income Shares Share\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nBasic EPS:\nNet income available to common shareholders$ 107,983 65,711 $ 1.64 $ 125,643 65,493 $ 1.92 $ 152,152 66,525 $ 2.29\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nOptions to purchase common stock 228 — 369 (0.01) 596 (0.02)\nRestricted shares 741 (0.02) 797 (0.03) 910 (0.03)\nPerformance stock units 180 — 124 — — —\nDiluted EPS:\nNet income available to common shareholders$ 107,983 66,860 $ 1.62 $ 125,643 66,783 $ 1.88 $ 152,152 68,031 $ 2.24\nFor fiscal 2024, options to purchase 0.3 million shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the\ncommon shares and, therefore, the effect of including these options would be anti-dilutive.\nFor fiscal 2023, options to purchase 0.6 million shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the\ncommon shares and, therefore, the effect of including these options would be anti-dilutive.\nFor fiscal 2022, options to purchase 0.4 million shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the\ncommon shares and, therefore, the effect of including these options would be anti-dilutive.\n17. Transactions with Related Parties\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, Tech Pac, a subsidiary of the Company, made purchases from Contract Packaging, Inc, (“CPI”), Tech Pac’s principal supplier and a minority 20% shareholder in Tech Pac.\nTech Pac’s total purchases from CPI were approximately $37.0 million, $31.0 million and $41.0 million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amounts due to CPI as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 were $1.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\n18. Business Segment Data\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer. Operating segments are managed separately because each segment represents a strategic business that offers different products\nor services. The Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based on operating income or loss. The Company’s Corporate division is included in the following presentation since certain\nexpenses of this division are not allocated separately to the two operating segments. Segment assets exclude cash equivalents, short-term investments, goodwill, and deferred taxes.\nManagement has determined that the Company has two operating segments which are also reportable segments based on the level at which the chief operating decision maker reviews the results of\noperations to make decisions regarding performance assessment and resource allocation. These operating segments are the Pet segment and the Garden segment. Substantially all of the Company’s assets and\noperations relate to its business in the United States.\nF-36\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Pet segment consists of Nylabone Products, IMS Trading, Four Paws Products, Central Specialty Pet (Avian and Small Animal, C&S Products and Aquatics), Segrest, K&H Pet Products, Arden, DMC, Life\nSciences, Interpet, General Pet and Pet Distribution. These businesses are engaged in the manufacture, purchase, sale and delivery of internally and externally produced pet supplies, animal health and insect\ncontrols, aquariums, books, dog treats and food, as well as live fish and small animals principally to independent pet distributors, big-box retailers, regional retailer chains, eCommerce retailers, grocery stores and\nmass merchants.

However, the expenditure of\nreasonable amounts of time for educational, charitable, or professional activities for which you will not receive additional\ncompensation from Central shall be permissible if those activities do not materially interfere with the services required of you as CEO.\n2. COMPENSATION. Your base salary pay will increase to $900,000 per year, less applicable taxes and deductions, based on a normal\nfull-time year.\nYou will be eligible to participate in Central’s Management Incentive Plan, Corporate Segment, at a target rate of 100% of your annual\nbase salary beginning with the 2025 Fiscal Year.

The amount of an equity grant is not guaranteed and will be based upon both your individual and\nCentral's performance, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion.

If you become physically or mentally disabled or incapacitated such\nthat it is the reasonable, good faith opinion of Central that you are unable to perform the services required as CEO with or without\nreasonable accommodation, then after four (4) months of continuous physical or mental disability, your employment will be\nterminated. During the four (4) month period, you will be entitled to the continuation of your compensation; however, such continued\npayments by Central shall be integrated with any disability, workers’ compensation, or other insurance payments received, such that\nthe total amount does not exceed the compensation as provided by this letter.

Other Persons. On an ongoing basis, the Company will determine that certain persons, together with the Section 16 Individuals,\nshould be subject to the preclearance requirement described in Section IV.A. below, in that the Company believes that, in the normal course of\ntheir duties, such persons have, or are likely to have, regular access to Inside Information. The Company will maintain a list of such persons\nwhich may be amended from time to time (Trading Window List). Under special circumstances, certain additional persons may come to have\naccess to Inside Information for a period of time. During such period, such persons should also be subject to the preclearance procedure\ndescribed in Section IV.A. below.\n1\nIII. Appointment of Compliance Officer.\nThe Company has appointed its Chief Financial Officer (or such officer’s designee) as the Company’s Insider Trading Compliance\nOfficer (the “Compliance Officer”). The Compliance Officer is assisted by the Company’s General Counsel.\nIV. Duties of Compliance Officer.\nThe duties of the Compliance Officer, directly or through his designees, shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\nA.

Assisting the Company’s Board of Directors in implementation of the Policy and Sections I and II of this Memorandum.\n2\nOctober 2024\n3\nATTACHMENT A\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nand Guidelines with Respect to\nCertain Transactions in Company Securities\nThis Policy provides guidelines to employees, officers and directors of Central Garden & Pet Company (the “Company”) with respect to\ntransactions in the Company’s securities.\nApplicability of Policy\nThis Policy applies to all transactions in the Company’s securities, including common stock, options for common stock and any other\nsecurities the Company may issue from time to time, such as preferred stock, warrants and convertible debentures, as well as to derivative\nsecurities relating to the Company’s stock, whether or not issued by the Company, such as exchange-traded options. It applies to all officers of\nthe Company, all members of the Company’s Board of Directors, and all employees of, and consultants and contractors to, the Company and\nits subsidiaries, if any, who receive or have access to Material Nonpublic Information (as defined below) regarding the Company. This group of\npeople, members of their immediate families, and members of their households are sometimes referred to in this Policy as “Insiders.” This\nPolicy also applies to any person who receives Material Nonpublic Information from any Insider.\nAny person who possesses Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company is an Insider for so long as the information is not\npublicly known. Any employee can be an Insider from time to time, and would at those times be subject to this Policy.\nStatement of Policy\nGeneral Policy\nIt is the policy of the Company to oppose the unauthorized disclosure of any nonpublic information acquired in the work-place and the\nmisuse of Material Nonpublic Information in securities trading.\nDefinition of Material Nonpublic Information\nIt is not possible to define all categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a\nreasonable likelihood that it would be considered important to an investor in making an investment decision regarding the purchase or sale of\nthe Company’s securities.\n4\nWhile it may be difficult under this standard to determine whether particular information is material, there are various categories of\ninformation that are particularly sensitive and, as a general rule, should always be considered material. Examples of such information may\ninclude:\nFinancial results\nProjections of future earnings or losses\n• Sales forecasts\nNews of a pending or proposed merger\nNews of the disposition of a subsidiary\nImpending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems\nGain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier\nChanges in dividend policy\nNew product announcements of a significant nature\nSignificant product defects or modifications\nSignificant pricing changes\nStock splits\nNew equity or debt offerings\nAcquisitions\nSignificant litigation exposure due to actual or threatened litigation\nMajor changes in senior management.\nEither positive or negative information may be material.\nNonpublic information is information that has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not available to the\ngeneral public.\nSpecific Policies\n1. Trading on Material Nonpublic Information. No director, officer or employee of, or consultant or contractor to, the Company,\nand no member of the immediate family or household of any such person, shall engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the\nCompany’s securities, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, during any period commencing with the date that he or she possesses\nMaterial Nonpublic Information concerning the Company, and ending at the close of business on the second Trading Day following the date of\npublic disclosure of that information, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material. As used in this Policy, the term\n“Trading Day” shall mean a day on which national stock exchanges, including the NASDAQ Stock Market, are open for trading.\n2 . Tipping. No Insider shall disclose Material Nonpublic Information (commonly referred to as “tipping”) to any other person\n(including family members) where such information may be used by such person to his or her profit by trading in the securities of companies to\nwhich such information relates, nor shall such Insider or related person make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of Material\nNonpublic Information as to trading in the Company’s securities.\n3. Confidentiality of Nonpublic Information. Nonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and\nthe unauthorized disclosure of such information is forbidden.\n5\nPotential Criminal and Civil Liability and/or Disciplinary Action\n1. Liability for Insider Trading. Insiders may be subject to penalties of up to $1,000,000 and up to ten years in jail for engaging in\ntransactions in the Company’s securities at a time when they have knowledge of nonpublic information regarding the Company.\n2. Liability for Tipping. Insiders may also be liable for improper transactions by any person (commonly referred to as a “tippee”) to\nwhom they have disclosed nonpublic information regarding the Company or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions\non the basis of such information as to trading in the Company’s securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has imposed\nlarge penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading. The SEC, the stock exchanges and the National Association of\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to uncover insider trading.\n3. Possible Disciplinary Actions. Employees of the Company who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action by\nthe Company, which may include ineligibility for future participation in the Company’s equity incentive plans or termination of employment.\nGuidelines\n1. Trading Window. The period beginning the last month of each fiscal quarter and ending two Trading Days following the date of\npublic disclosure of the financial results for that quarter is a particularly sensitive period of time for transactions in the Company’s stock from\nthe perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws. This sensitivity is due to the fact that officers, directors and certain other\nemployees will, during that period, often possess Material Nonpublic Information about the expected financial results for the quarter.\nAccordingly, to ensure compliance with this Policy and applicable federal and state securities laws, the Company requires that all\ndirectors, officers and employees having access to the Company’s internal financial statements or other Material Nonpublic Information refrain\nfrom conducting transactions involving the purchase or sale of the Company’s securities other than during the period (the “trading window”)\ncommencing at the close of business on the second Trading Day following the date of public disclosure of the financial results for a particular\nfiscal quarter or year and continuing until the later of (i) the close of business on the last day of the second month of the next fiscal quarter or\n(ii) fifteen calendar days following the date of public disclosure of the financial results for the most recent quarter. The trading window\nrestrictions do not apply to the exercise of options so long as the stock that is purchased as a result of the option exercise is held and not sold\noutside of a trading window. The safest period for trading in the Company’s securities, assuming the absence of Material Nonpublic\nInformation, is probably only the first ten days of the trading window.\n6\nFrom time to time, the Company may also recommend that directors, officers, selected employees and others suspend trading because\nof developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such event, such persons are advised not to engage in any\ntransaction involving the purchase or sale of the Company’s securities during such period and should not disclose to others the fact of such\nsuspension of trading.\nThe purpose behind the “trading window” period is to help establish a diligent effort to avoid any improper transaction. It should be\nnoted, however, that even during the trading window, any person possessing Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company should\nnot engage in any transactions in the Company’s securities until such information has been known publicly for at least two Trading Days,\nwhether or not the Company has recommended a suspension of trading to that person. Trading in the Company’s securities during the trading\nwindow should not be considered a “safe harbor,” and all directors, officers and other persons should use good judgment at all times.\n2. Preclearance of Trades. The Company has determined that all officers and directors of the Company should refrain from trading\nin the Company’s securities, even during the trading window, without first complying with the Company’s “preclearance” process. Each\nofficer and director should contact the Company’s Compliance Officer or such officer’s designee prior to commencing any trade in the\nCompany’s securities. The Company may find it necessary, from time to time, to require compliance with the preclearance process from certain\nemployees, consultants and contractors other than and in addition to officers and directors.\n3 . Individual Responsibility. Every officer, director and employee has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy\nagainst insider trading, regardless of whether the Company has recommended a trading window to that Insider or any other Insiders of the\nCompany. The guidelines set forth in this Policy are guidelines only, and appropriate judgment should be exercised in connection with any\ntrade in the Company’s securities.\nAn Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company’s securities even if he or she planned to make\nthe transaction before learning of the Material Nonpublic Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic\nloss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.\nApplicability of Policy to Inside Information Regarding Other Companies\nThis Policy and the guidelines described in this Policy also apply to Material Nonpublic Information relating to other companies,\nincluding the Company’s customers, vendors or suppliers (“Business Partners”), when that information is obtained in the course of\nemployment with, or other services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties, and termination of employment, may\nresult from trading on inside information regarding the Company’s Business Partners. All employees should treat Material Nonpublic\nInformation about the Company’s Business Partners with the same care required with respect to information related directly to the Company.\n7\nCertain Exceptions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the Company considers that the exercise of stock options under the Company’s stock option plans\n(including, if done in accordance with the terms of such plans, exercise with cash or exercise by surrendering shares) or the purchase of shares\nunder the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (but not the sale of any such shares) is exempt from this Policy, since the other party to\nthe transaction is the Company itself and the price does not vary with the market but is fixed by the terms of the option agreement or the plan.\nRule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides an affirmative defense against insider trading liability under federal\nsecurities laws for a transaction done pursuant to “blind trusts” (generally, trusts or other arrangements in which investment control has been\ncompletely delegated to a third party, such as an institutional or professional trustee) or pursuant to a written plan, or a binding contract or\ninstruction, entered into in good faith at a time when the insider was not aware of material nonpublic information, even though the transaction\nin question may occur at a time when the person is aware of material nonpublic information. The Company may, in appropriate circumstances,\npermit transactions pursuant to a blind trust or a pre-arranged trading program that complies with Rule 10b5-1 to take place during periods in\nwhich the individual entering into the transaction may have material nonpublic information or during black-out periods.\nIf you wish to enter into a blind trust arrangement or a pre-arranged trading program, you must notify the Compliance Officer. The\nCompliance Officer will review proposed arrangements to determine whether they will or may result in transactions taking place during\nperiods in which you may be in possession of material nonpublic information. The Company reserves the right to bar any transactions in\nCompany stock, even those pursuant to arrangements previously approved, if the Company determines that such a bar is in the best interests of\nthe Company.\nAdditional Information - Directors and Officers\nDirectors and officers of the Company must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set\nforth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The practical effect of these provisions is that officers and directors\nwho both purchase and sell the Company’s securities within a six-month period must disgorge all profits to the Company whether or not they\nhad knowledge of any Material Nonpublic Information. Under these provisions, and so long as certain other criteria are met, neither the receipt\nof an option under the Company’s option plans, nor the exercise of that option, nor the receipt of stock under the Company’s employee stock\npurchase plan is deemed a purchase under Section 16; however, the sale of any such shares is a sale under Section 16. Moreover, no officer or\ndirector may ever make a short sale of the Company’s stock, or an equivalent transaction, such as selling put options. The Company has\nprovided, or will provide, separate memoranda and other appropriate materials to its officers and directors regarding compliance with\nSection 16 and its related rules.\n8\nRestrictions on Certain Trading Activities\nNo short sales of the Company securities. You may not engage in short sales of the Company securities (sales of securities that are\nnot then owned), including “sales against the box” (short sales not exceeding the number of shares already owned). Generally, short sales are\ntransactions whereby a person will benefit from a decline in the price of the securities, and the Company believes it is inappropriate for\nassociates to engage in these transactions with respect to the Company securities.\nNo trading in derivatives of the Company. You may not trade in derivatives of the Company’s securities, such as exchange-traded\nput or call options and forward transactions.\nNo hedging transactions. Certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions may offset a decrease, or limit your ability to profit\nfrom an increase, in the value of the Company securities you hold, enabling you to continue to own the Company securities without the full\nrisks and rewards of ownership. The Company believes that such transactions separate the holder's interests from those of other stockholders.\nTherefore, you and any person acting on your behalf are prohibited from purchasing any financial instruments (such as prepaid variable\nforward contracts, equity swaps, collars or exchange funds) or otherwise engaging in any transactions that hedge or offset any decrease in the\nmarket value of the Company securities or limit your ability to profit from an increase in the market value of the Company securities.\nLimited use of standing orders. Standing orders should be used only for three business days. A standing order placed with a broker to\nsell or purchase stock at a specified price leaves you with no control over the timing of the transaction. A standing order transaction executed\nby the broker when you are aware of material nonpublic information may result in unlawful insider trading. A standing order incorporated into\na 10b5-1 plan approved by the Company is permitted.\nInquiries\nPlease direct your questions as to any of the matters discussed in this Policy to Bradley G. Smith, the Company’s Compliance Officer,\nor such officer’s designee at (925) 948-4000.\n9\nATTACHMENT B\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe undersigned certifies that he or she has read, understands and agrees to comply with Central Garden & Pet Company’s Insider Trading\nCompliance Program and Policy.

Purpose\nCentral Garden & Pet Company (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is committed to promoting high standards of honest and ethical business\nconduct and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. As part of this commitment, the Company has adopted this Compensation Recovery Policy\n(this “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act”) and explains\nwhen the Company will be required or authorized, as applicable, to seek recovery of Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to a Covered Person. Please refer\nto Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Definitions Exhibit”) for the definitions of capitalized terms used throughout this Policy.\n2. Miscalculation of Financial Performance Measure Results\nIn the event of a Restatement, the Company will seek to recover, reasonably promptly, all Recoverable Incentive Compensation from a Covered Person during\nthe Applicable Period. Such recovery, in the case of a Restatement, will be made without regard to any individual knowledge or responsibility related to the\nRestatement or the Recoverable Incentive Compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is required to undertake a Restatement, the Company\nwill not be required to recover the Recoverable Incentive Compensation if the Compensation Committee determines it Impracticable to do so, after exercising a\nnormal due process review of all the relevant facts and circumstances.\nThe Company will seek to recover all Recoverable Incentive Compensation that was awarded or paid in accordance with the definition of “Recoverable\nIncentive Compensation” set forth on the Definitions Exhibit. If such Recoverable Incentive Compensation was not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the\nCompany will seek to recover the amount that the Compensation Committee determines in good faith should be recouped.\n3. Legal and Compliance Violations\nCompliance with the law and the Company’s Code of Ethics and other corporate policies is a pre-condition to earning Incentive Compensation. If the Company\nin its sole discretion concludes that a Covered Person (1) has engaged in Misconduct; or (2) was aware of or willfully blind to Misconduct that occurred in an\narea over which the Covered Person had supervisory authority, the Company may, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, seek recovery of all or a\nportion of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to the Covered Person for the Applicable Period in which the violation occurred. In\naddition, the Company may, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, conclude that any unpaid or unvested Incentive Compensation has not been\nearned and must be forfeited.\nIn the event of Misconduct, the Company may seek recovery of Recoverable Incentive Compensation even if the Misconduct did not result in an award or\npayment greater than would have been awarded or paid absent the Misconduct.\n1 Note: This draft policy is designed to address the requirements of Exchange Act 10D-1 and the related Nasdaq listing standards.\nIn the event of Misconduct, in determining whether to seek recovery and the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should be reduced, the\nCompensation Committee may consider—among other things—the seriousness of the Misconduct, whether the Covered Person was unjustly enriched,\nwhether seeking the recovery would prejudice the Company’s interests in any way, including in a proceeding or investigation, and any other factors it deems\nrelevant to the determination.\n4. Other Actions\nThe Compensation Committee may, subject to applicable law, seek recovery in the manner it chooses, including by seeking reimbursement from the Covered\nPerson of all or part of the compensation awarded or paid, by electing to withhold unpaid compensation, by set-off, or by rescinding or canceling unvested stock.\nIn the reasonable exercise of its business judgment under this Policy, the Compensation Committee may in its sole discretion determine whether and to what\nextent additional action is appropriate to address the circumstances surrounding a Restatement or Misconduct to minimize the likelihood of any recurrence and\nto impose such other discipline as it deems appropriate.\n5. No Indemnification or Reimbursement\nNotwithstanding the terms of any other policy, program, agreement or arrangement, in no event will the Company or any of its affiliates indemnify or reimburse a\nCovered Person for any loss under this Policy and in no event will the Company or any of its affiliates pay premiums on any insurance policy that would cover a\nCovered Person’s potential obligations with respect to Recoverable Incentive Compensation under this Policy.\n6. Administration of Policy\nThe Compensation Committee will have full authority to administer this Policy. Actions of the Compensation Committee pursuant to this Policy will be taken by\nthe vote of a majority of its members. The Compensation Committee will, subject to the provisions of this Policy and Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, and the\nNasdaq Stock Market listing standards, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions in connection with this Policy as it deems\nnecessary, appropriate or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Compensation Committee will be final, binding and conclusive.\n7. Other Claims and Rights\nThe remedies under this Policy are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any legal and equitable claims the Company or any of its affiliates may have or any actions\nthat may be imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators, administrative bodies, or other authorities. Further, the exercise by the Compensation\nCommittee of any rights pursuant to this Policy will not impact any other rights that the Company or any of its affiliates may have with respect to any Covered\nPerson subject to this Policy.\n8. Acknowledgement by Covered Persons; Condition to Eligibility for Incentive Compensation\nThe Company will provide notice and seek acknowledgement of this Policy, from each Covered Person, provided that the failure to provide such notice or obtain\nsuch acknowledgement will have no impact on the applicability or enforceability of this Policy. After the Effective Date, the Company must be in receipt of a\nCovered Person's acknowledgement as a condition to such Covered Person’s eligibility to receive Incentive Compensation. All Incentive Compensation subject\nto this Policy will not be earned, even if\n2\nalready paid, until the Policy ceases to apply to such Incentive Compensation and any other vesting conditions applicable to such Incentive Compensation are\nsatisfied.\n9. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board or the Compensation Committee may amend or terminate this Policy at any time.\n10.Effectiveness\nExcept as otherwise determined in writing by the Compensation Committee, this Policy will apply to any Incentive Compensation that (a) in the case of any\nRestatement, is Received by a Covered Person on or after the Effective Date, and (b) in the case of Misconduct, is awarded or paid to a Covered Person after\nthe Effective Date. This Policy will survive and continue notwithstanding any termination of a Covered Person’s employment with the Company and its affiliates.\n11.Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their successors, beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal\nrepresentatives.\n12.Governing Law\nTo the extent not preempted by U.S. federal law, this Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without\nreference to principles of conflict of laws.\n3\nExhibit A\nCENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY\nCOMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\nDEFINITIONS EXHIBIT\n“Applicable Period” means (a) in the case of any Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the\ndate the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes (or\nreasonably should have concluded) that a Restatement is required or (ii) the date a regulator, court or other legally authorized entity directs the Company to\nundertake a Restatement, and (b) in the case of any Misconduct, such period as the Compensation Committee or Board determines to be appropriate in light of\nthe scope and nature of the Misconduct. The “Applicable Period” also includes any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year)\nwithin or immediately following the three completed fiscal years identified in the preceding sentence.\n“Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n“Compensation Committee” means the Company’s committee of independent directors responsible for executive compensation decisions, or in the absence of\nsuch a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board.\n“Covered Person” means (a) in the case of any Restatement, any person who is, or was at any time, during the Applicable Period, an Executive Officer of the\nCompany, and (b) in the case of any Misconduct, any person who was an Executive Officer of the Company or who reported directly to the Company’s principal\nexecutive officer at the time of the Misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, a Covered Person may include a former Executive Officer that left the Company,\nretired, or transitioned to an employee role (including after serving as an Executive Officer in an interim capacity) during the Applicable Period.\n“Effective Date” means October 2, 2023.\n“Executive Officer” means the Company’s principal executive officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such\naccounting officer, the controller), any vice-president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any\nother officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person (including an officer of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries) who performs similar\npolicy-making functions for the Company.\n“Financial Performance Measure” means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements (including “non-GAAP” financial measures, such as those appearing in the Company’s earnings releases or Management\nDiscussion and Analysis), and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures\nderived wholly or in part therefrom) shall be considered Financial Performance Measures.\n“Impracticable.” The Compensation Committee may determine in good faith that recovery of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is “Impracticable” (a) in the\ncase of any Restatement, if: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the Recoverable Incentive Compensation\nand the Company has (A) made a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts and (B) provided documentation of such attempts to recover to the Nasdaq\nStock Market; or (ii) recovery\nwould likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and (b) in the case of any Misconduct, in its sole discretion, in light of the scope and nature of\nthe Misconduct.\n“Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Performance\nMeasure. Incentive Compensation does not include any base salaries (except with respect to any salary increases earned wholly or in part based on the\nattainment of a Financial Performance Measure performance goal); bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or Board that are not\npaid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a Financial Performance Measure performance goal; bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more\nsubjective standards (e.g., demonstrated leadership) and/or completion of a specified employment period; non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon\nsatisfying one or more strategic measures (e.g., consummating a merger or divestiture) or operational measures (e.g., increase in market share or completion of\na project); and equity awards that vest solely based on the passage of time and/or attaining one or more non-Financial Performance Measures. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, in the case of any Misconduct, Incentive Compensation will include all forms of cash and equity incentive compensation, including, without\nlimitation, cash bonuses and equity awards that are received or vest solely based on the passage of time and/or attaining one or more non-Financial\nPerformance Measures.\n“Misconduct” shall have the same meaning as “Cause” as such term is expressly defined in a then-effective written employment agreement between the\nCovered Person and the Company or its applicable affiliate or, in the absence of such then-effective written employment agreement and definition, shall mean a\nCovered Person’s (i) commission of any felony; (ii) attempted commission of, or participation in, a fraud or act of dishonesty against the Company; (iii)\ncommission of a significant legal or compliance violation in connection with the Covered Person’s employment, including a violation of the Company’s Code of\nEthics or other corporate policies; (iv) intentional, material violation of any contract or agreement between the Covered Person and the Company or of any\nstatutory duty owed to the Company; (v) unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company’s confidential information or trade secrets; or (vi) any action or willful\ninaction that may result in material financial, reputational or other harm to the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries.\n“Received.” Incentive Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Performance Measure specified in the\nIncentive Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n“Recoverable Incentive Compensation” means (a) in the case of any Restatement, the amount of any Incentive Compensation (calculated on a pre-tax basis)\nReceived by a Covered Person during the Applicable Period that is in excess of the amount that otherwise would have been Received if the calculation were\nbased on the Restatement, and (b) in the case of any Misconduct, the amount of any Incentive Compensation (calculated on a pre-tax basis) awarded or paid to\na Covered Person during the Applicable Period that the Compensation Committee determines, in its sole discretion, to be appropriate in light of the scope and\nnature of the Misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any Restatement, Recoverable Incentive Compensation does not include any Incentive\nCompensation Received by a person (i) before such person began service in a position or capacity meeting the definition of a “Covered Person,” (ii) who did not\nserve as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation, or (iii) during any period the Company did not have a\nclass of its securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any Restatement,\nRecoverable Incentive Compensation may include Incentive Compensation Received by a person while serving as an employee if such person previously\nserved as an Executive Officer and then transitioned to an employee role. For Incentive Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total\nshareholder return where the amount of Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Restatement, the amount will be determined by the\nCompensation Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive Compensation was Received (in which case, the Company will maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide\nsuch documentation to the Company’s applicable listing exchange).\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement of any of the Company’s financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the\nExchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S.\nsecurities laws, regardless of whether the Company or Covered Person misconduct was the cause for such restatement. “Restatement” includes any required\naccounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly\nreferred to as “Big R” restatements), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the\ncurrent period (commonly referred to as “little r” restatements)."

View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241125974807/en/>\n\n\"We have a lot to be proud of this year. We increased non-GAAP EPS, continued margin expansion, made significant progress on our Cost and Simplicity program, and achieved strong profits in our Pet segment and record cash flow for the company. We accomplished this despite continued soft demand across our Pet segment, in particular in durable pet products, and a difficult garden season,\" said Niko Lahanas, Central Garden & Pet's new CEO. \"While we expect the external environment to remain challenging, I am confident we have the right strategy and people in place to deliver profitable growth in fiscal 2025 and for the long term.\"\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales were $3.2 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the prior year, a decrease of 3%. Fiscal 2023 benefited from an additional week in the fourth quarter. Organic net sales decreased 4% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS in fiscal 2024 and the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business in fiscal 2023.\n\nNet sales for the Pet segment were $1.83 billion compared to $1.88 billion a year ago, a decrease of 2%. Pet organic net sales decreased 6%. Net sales for the Garden segment were $1.37 billion compared to $1.43 billion in the prior year, a decrease of 5%. Garden organic net sales decreased 1%.\n\nGross margin expanded by 90 basis points to 29.5% from 28.6% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin expanded by 110 basis points to 30.0% from 28.9% a year ago driven by productivity efforts and moderating inflation.\n\nOperating income was $185 million compared to $211 million in the prior year, a decrease of 12%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $223 million compared to $227 million a year ago. Operating margin was 5.8% compared to 6.4% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded to 7.0% from 6.9% a year ago due to improved gross margin and continued cost discipline in selling, general and administrative expense.\n\nNet interest expense was $38 million compared to $50 million in the prior year driven by higher interest income.\n\nOther expense was $5.1 million compared to other income of $1.5 million a year ago due to the impairment of two underperforming equity investments in the fourth quarter.\n\nNet income was $108 million compared to $126 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income increased to $142 million from $138 million a year ago. Earnings per share were $1.62 compared to $1.88 in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share increased to $2.13 from $2.07 a year ago.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $334 million compared to $343 million in the prior year.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 23.2% compared to 22.4% a year ago primarily due to an increase in the blended state income tax rate in the current year compared to the prior year.\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales were $669 million compared to $750 million a year ago, a decrease of 11%. The prior year quarter benefited from an extra week. Organic net sales decreased 13% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS and the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business.\n\nGross margin contracted by 110 basis points to 25.2% compared to 26.3% a year ago primarily driven by the impairment of grass seed inventory more than offsetting moderating inflation and productivity efforts. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin contracted by 60 basis points to 26.0% from 26.6% in the prior year.\n\nOperating loss was $32 million compared to operating income of $9 million a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $11 million compared to operating income of $12 million reflecting lower volumes, the inventory impairment, and the timing of expenses related to productivity and commercial initiatives. Operating margin was (4.8)% compared to 1.2% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin contracted to (1.7)% from 1.6% a year ago.\n\nOther expense was $6 million compared to $2 million in the prior year.\n\nNet interest expense was $6 million compared to $8 million a year ago.\n\nNet loss was $34 million compared to net income of $3 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss was $12 million compared to net income $5 million a year ago. Loss per share was $0.51 compared to earnings per share of $0.04 in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, loss per share was $0.18 compared to earnings per share of $0.08 a year ago.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $17 million compared to $42 million in the prior year.\n\n**Pet Segment Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales for the Pet segment were $435 million compared to $483 million in the prior year, a decrease of 10%. The decrease was primarily due to an extra week in the prior year quarter. Organic net sales decreased 14% excluding the impact of the acquisition of TDBBS.\n\nThe Pet segment’s operating income was $14 million compared to $43 million a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $35 million compared to $48 million in the prior year due to lower volume and the timing of expenses related to productivity and commercial initiatives. Operating margin was 3.3% compared to 9.0% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 8.0% compared to 9.9% a year ago.\n\nPet segment adjusted EBITDA was $45 million compared to $58 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Garden Segment Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales for the Garden segment were $234 million compared to $267 million a year ago, a decrease of 12%. The decrease was primarily due to an extra week in the prior year quarter. Organic net sales decreased 11% excluding the impact of the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business.\n\nThe Garden segment’s operating loss was $29 million compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $25 million compared to a loss of $5 million a year ago due to lower volume as well as the impairment of grass seed inventory. Operating margin was (12.3)% compared to (1.3)% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was (10.6)% compared to (2.0)% a year ago.\n\nGarden segment adjusted EBITDA was $(14) million compared to $6 million in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt**\n\nAt September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents was $754 million, compared to $489 million a year ago. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by converting inventory to cash over the last 12 months and lower capital expenditures.\n\nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2024 was $395 million, compared to $382 million in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to changes in working capital driven by the reduction in inventory.\n\nTotal debt at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion. The gross leverage ratio, calculated using the definitions for Indebtedness and EBITDA in Central's credit agreement, at the end of the quarter was 3.1x, in line with the prior year. Central repurchased 270,032 shares or $9 million of its stock during the quarter. Subsequent to the fiscal year end, Central purchased an additional 1,663,479 shares or $52 million of its stock through November 21, 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Adjustments**\n\n**Fiscal 2024**\n\nCentral recognized $45 million in non-GAAP charges in fiscal 2024, $28 million of which related to Cost & Simplicity initiatives.\n\nWithin the Garden segment, this included closure and consolidation of one manufacturing facility, six distribution facilities and one research facility as well as beginning the wind-down of Central's pottery business. Within the Pet segment, this included the announced closure and consolidation of two manufacturing facilities related to a durable pet supply business as well as impairment of intangible assets related to this business due to changing market conditions and increased international competition.\n\nIn addition to Cost & Simplicity related charges, Central recognized $4 million in charges related to the impairment of equity investments in two underperforming private businesses, partially offset by a gain on the settlement of a litigation.\n\nThe $45 million overall charge was mostly noncash, with $16 million included in cost of goods sold, $21 million in selling, general and administrative expense, and $8 million in other expense.\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024**\n\nNon-GAAP charges for the fourth quarter were $29 million, $12 million of which related to Cost & Simplicity initiatives, $13 million related to intangible impairments, and $4 million related to the equity investment write downs and partially offsetting a gain on the settlement of a litigation.\n\nThe $29 million overall charge was mostly noncash, with $5 million included in cost of goods sold, $16 million in selling, general and administrative expense, and $8 million in other expense.\n\n**Outlook for Fiscal 2025**\n\nCentral currently expects fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS to be $2.20 or better. This outlook takes into consideration deflationary pressure in certain commodity businesses, evolving consumer behavior in an environment of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the challenging brick-and-mortar retail environment. Central expects fiscal 2025 capital spending to be in the range of $60-70 million. This outlook excludes the impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or restructuring activities that may occur during fiscal 2025, including projects under the Cost and Simplicity program.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCentral will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time), hosted by Niko Lahanas, CEO, and Brad Smith, CFO, to discuss these results and to provide a general business update.

However, to supplement the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted EBITDA and organic net sales. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specific items (described below) in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance.\n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our ongoing operating performance and provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. While Management believes that non-GAAP measures are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by us as income before income tax, net other expense, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense (or operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). Adjusted EBITDA further excludes one-time charges related to facility closures exits of business, intangible and investment impairments and gains from a litigation settlement. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the cash flows and performance of our business and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management to perform such evaluations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operations, income from operations or other income statement measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and it may not be comparable.\n\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below.\n\nWe have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as we cannot do so without unreasonable efforts due to the potential variability and limited visibility of excluded items. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\n\n  * _Facility closures and business exit_ : we have excluded charges related to the closure of distribution and manufacturing facilities and our decision to exit the pottery business as they represent infrequent transactions that impact the comparability between operating periods. We believe these exclusions supplement the GAAP information with a measure that may be useful to investors in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance.\n  * _Asset impairment charges_ : we exclude the impact of asset impairments on intangible assets and investments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency. We believe that the adjustment of these charges supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Gain from litigation settlement_ : we exclude the gain from a litigation settlement as it is a one-time occurrence. We believe that the exclusion of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Gain on sale of a business or service line_ : we exclude the impact of the gain on the sale of a business as it represents an infrequent transaction that occurs in limited circumstances that impacts the comparability between operating periods. We believe the adjustment of this gain supplements the GAAP information with a measure that may be used to assess the performance of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Tax impact_ : adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment.\n\n\n\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\n\nThe non-GAAP adjustments made reflect the following:\n\n**Facility closures and business exits**\n\n(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $7.5 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of manufacturing facilities in California and Arizona. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to facility closures and business exits announced in fiscal 2023 and earlier in fiscal 2024.\n\n(2) During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $11.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations, from the decision to exit the pottery business, the closure of a live goods distribution facility in Delaware and the relocation of our grass seed research facility.\n\n(3) During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized incremental expense of $5.3 million in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing facility in California and the consolidation of our Southeast distribution network.\n\n(4) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a gain of $5.8 million from the sale of our independent garden center distribution business, which includes the impact of associated facility closure costs. The gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n(5) In fiscal 2023, we recognized incremental expense of $13.9 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations from the closure of a manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas. Additionally, we recognized incremental expense of $1.8 million in our Pet segment in the consolidated statement of operations, from the closure of a second manufacturing and distribution facility in Texas.\n\n**Intangible Impairments**\n\n(6) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $12.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due primarily to changing market conditions resulting from the decline in demand for durable products and increased international competition.\n\n(7) In fiscal 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Pet segment of $2.8 million related to the impairment of intangible assets caused by the loss of a significant customer in our live fish business. Also, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in our Garden segment of $3.9 million related to the impairment of intangible assets due to reduced demand for products we sold under an acquired trade name. The impairments were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative costs.\n\n**Gain from litigation and investment impairment**\n\n(8) Within corporate, the Company received $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 in settlement of litigation which gain is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Additionally, we recognized a $7.5 million non-cash impairment charge for two related private company investments that is included within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n**Net Income and Diluted Net Income Per Share Reconciliation** |  **GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation**  \n---|---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Fiscal Year Ended**  \n**September 28,

We operate primarily within the pet supplies and live fish and small animal categories, and we estimate these markets generate approximately $39 billion in annual retail sales.\n\nOver 2,500 manufacturers, ranging from mostly single-category or limited-range players to approximately two dozen companies with a solid multi-category presence. The majority of these smaller companies do not have a captive sales and logistics network and rely on us or other independent distributors to supply their products to regional pet specialty chains and independent retailers.\n\neCommerce was a driving force in the pet retail business totaling 36% of pet products in 2022, with Packaged Facts expecting the total to continue to increase to 45% in 2025. \n\n#### Branded Pet Products\n\nOur principal pet categories are dog & cat, aquatics and reptile, small animal and bird supplies, animal health products, and live fish and small animals.\n\n**Dog and Cat** – Our dog and cat products include premium edible and non-edible chews, interactive toys, grooming supplies and pet beds, pet containment, training and waste management solutions.\n\n  * Cadet® bully sticks, rawhide and other natural dog chews and treats\n  * Four Paws® grooming and health & wellness products, Wee-Wee® training pads and waste management solutions\n  * K&H Pet Products® premium pet supplies and heated pet products\n  * Mikki professional pet grooming supplies\n  * Nylabone® dog chew toys, Nubz®, Healthy Edibles® long-lasting dog chews and NutriDent® dental chews\n\n\n\n**Aquatics and Reptiles** – We supply aquariums and terrariums along with their fixtures and stands, food, water conditioners and supplements, lighting systems and accessories under these brands:\n\n  * Aqueon® aquarium products\n  * Blagdon® pond equipment and water gardening\n  * Coralife® specialized aquatics products\n  * Interpet® aquarium treatments and equipment\n  * Zilla® reptile products\n\n\n\n**Small Animal and Bird** – Our proprietary supplies and pet food for small animals, pet birds and wild birds offer species-specific diets, treats, habitats, bedding, hay and toys.
