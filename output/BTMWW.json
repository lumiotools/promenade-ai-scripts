(“Bitcoin Depot” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and link to the webcast will be made available at [ir.bitcoindepot.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EbRig5EnsAfflYexZ4TzGzL1e0x8LXWmr_-O1jWhnp0En040--xMVOnKJE4Fecw4wSjFk-oRO7Qz--AhMpXg4ky9mQ7sHSaVg-Y4DNd4800= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network while working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing our goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising locations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While this improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy is proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend to common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable legislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the Company’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet profitability.\n\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net income of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating expenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million, down 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to 16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decline was due to the lower revenue. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $32.2 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Company generated $5.8 million in cash flows from operations in the third quarter and $17.3 million for the first nine months of 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated $5.8 million of cash flow from operations compared to $7.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBitcoin Depot will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) today to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nCall Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) U.S. dial-in: 646-968-2525International dial-in: 888-596-4144Conference ID: 7631242\n\nThe conference call will broadcast live and be available for replay [**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R-HVzeT6XLjd-kqv5f_Whd-4Z20z47F3NkMhAGzG2PoKWqQOZo0Tjw9NOPvOXpCedushXujNq98i6Bop46NV9CLcTBuRAqATYQ4iohHshRY= \"Opens in a new window\") following the call.\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number approximately 10 minutes before the start time.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expectations of plans, business strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance, including our growth strategy and ability to increase deployment of our products and services, our ability to strengthen our financial profile, and worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,“ ”plan,“ ”potential,“ ”priorities,“ ”project,“ ”pursue,“ ”seek,“ ”should,“ ”target,“ ”when,“ ”will,“ ”would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond our control.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination; risks relating to the uncertainty of our projected financial information; future global, regional or local economic and market conditions; the development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; our ability to manage future growth; our ability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner and make enhancements to our platform; the effects of competition on our future business; our ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors described or referenced in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our assessments to change.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 32,229 | $ | 29,759  \nCryptocurrencies | 1,311 | 712  \nAccounts receivable | 380 | 245  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 7,453 | 6,554  \nTotal current assets | 41,373 | 37,270  \nProperty and equipment:  \nFurniture and fixtures | 635 | 635  \nLeasehold improvements | 172 | 172  \nKiosk machines - owned | 32,086 | 24,222  \nKiosk machines - leased | 20,004 | 20,524  \nTotal property and equipment | 52,897 | 45,553  \nLess: accumulated depreciation | (25,350 | ) | (20,699 | )  \nTotal property and equipment, net | 27,547 | 24,854  \nIntangible assets, net | 2,698 | 3,836  \nGoodwill | 8,717 | 8,717  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net | 2,814 | 484  \nDeposits | 736 | 412  \nDeferred tax assets | 3,562 | 1,804  \n**Total assets** | $ | 87,447 | $ | 77,377  \n  \n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity**  \nCurrent:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 11,965 | $ | 8,337  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 20,196 | 21,545  \nNotes payable, current portion | 4,860 | 3,985  \nIncome taxes payable | 1,355 | 2,484  \nDeferred revenue | 201 | 297  \nOperating lease liabilities, current portion | 887 | 279  \nCurrent installments of obligations under finance leases | 3,931 | 6,801  \nOther non-income tax payable | 2,236 | 2,297  \nTotal current liabilities | 45,631 | 46,025  \nLong-term liabilities  \nNotes payable, non-current | 41,864 | 17,101  \nOperating lease liabilities, non-current | 1,983 | 319  \nObligations under finance leases, non-current | 2,856 | 2,848  \nDeferred income tax, net | 852 | 846  \nTax receivable agreement liability due to related party, non-current | 2,126 | 865  \n**Total Liabilities** | 95,312 | 68,004  \n**Commitments and Contingencies (Note 19)**  \n**Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity**  \nSeries A Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value;

This press release includes both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit margin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based compensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments. Such items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin Depot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of operations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin Depot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key measurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial results, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future operating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\n\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: \n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** RECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA(UNAUDITED)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income | $ | 2,299 | $ | 1,065 | $ | 2,421 | $ | 3,143  \nAdjustments:  \nInterest expense | 2,907 | 2,769 | 10,731 | 10,120  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 347 | 337 | 479 | (977 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,245 | 3,260 | 8,184 | 9,554  \nExpense related to the PIPE transaction (1) | — | 2,700 | — | 12,281  \nNon-recurring expenses (2) | 297 | 2,873 | 1,204 | 7,664  \nShare-based compensation | 412 | 944 | 3,037 | 1,326  \nSpecial bonus (3) | 675 | — | 675 | 3,915  \nExpenses associated with the termination of the phantom equity participation plan | — | — | — | 350  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 9,182 | $ | 13,948 | $ | 26,731 | $ | 47,376  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) | 6.8 | % | 7.8 | % | 6.1 | % | 8.8 | %  \n  \n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the recognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to the PIPE transaction.

(“Bitcoin Depot” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and link to the webcast will be made available at [ir.bitcoindepot.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EbRig5EnsAfflYexZ4TzGzL1e0x8LXWmr_-O1jWhnp0En040--xMVOnKJE4Fecw4wSjFk-oRO7Qz--AhMpXg4ky9mQ7sHSaVg-Y4DNd4800= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network while working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing our goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising locations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While this improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy is proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend to common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable legislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the Company’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet profitability.\n\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net income of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating expenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million, down 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to 16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decline was due to the lower revenue. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $32.2 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Company generated $5.8 million in cash flows from operations in the third quarter and $17.3 million for the first nine months of 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated $5.8 million of cash flow from operations compared to $7.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBitcoin Depot will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) today to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nCall Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) U.S. dial-in: 646-968-2525International dial-in: 888-596-4144Conference ID: 7631242\n\nThe conference call will broadcast live and be available for replay [**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R-HVzeT6XLjd-kqv5f_Whd-4Z20z47F3NkMhAGzG2PoKWqQOZo0Tjw9NOPvOXpCedushXujNq98i6Bop46NV9CLcTBuRAqATYQ4iohHshRY= \"Opens in a new window\") following the call.\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number approximately 10 minutes before the start time.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expectations of plans, business strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance, including our growth strategy and ability to increase deployment of our products and services, our ability to strengthen our financial profile, and worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,“ ”plan,“ ”potential,“ ”priorities,“ ”project,“ ”pursue,“ ”seek,“ ”should,“ ”target,“ ”when,“ ”will,“ ”would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond our control.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination; risks relating to the uncertainty of our projected financial information; future global, regional or local economic and market conditions; the development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; our ability to manage future growth; our ability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner and make enhancements to our platform; the effects of competition on our future business; our ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors described or referenced in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our assessments to change.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 32,229 | $ | 29,759  \nCryptocurrencies | 1,311 | 712  \nAccounts receivable | 380 | 245  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 7,453 | 6,554  \nTotal current assets | 41,373 | 37,270  \nProperty and equipment:  \nFurniture and fixtures | 635 | 635  \nLeasehold improvements | 172 | 172  \nKiosk machines - owned | 32,086 | 24,222  \nKiosk machines - leased | 20,004 | 20,524  \nTotal property and equipment | 52,897 | 45,553  \nLess: accumulated depreciation | (25,350 | ) | (20,699 | )  \nTotal property and equipment, net | 27,547 | 24,854  \nIntangible assets, net | 2,698 | 3,836  \nGoodwill | 8,717 | 8,717  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net | 2,814 | 484  \nDeposits | 736 | 412  \nDeferred tax assets | 3,562 | 1,804  \n**Total assets** | $ | 87,447 | $ | 77,377  \n  \n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity**  \nCurrent:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 11,965 | $ | 8,337  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 20,196 | 21,545  \nNotes payable, current portion | 4,860 | 3,985  \nIncome taxes payable | 1,355 | 2,484  \nDeferred revenue | 201 | 297  \nOperating lease liabilities, current portion | 887 | 279  \nCurrent installments of obligations under finance leases | 3,931 | 6,801  \nOther non-income tax payable | 2,236 | 2,297  \nTotal current liabilities | 45,631 | 46,025  \nLong-term liabilities  \nNotes payable, non-current | 41,864 | 17,101  \nOperating lease liabilities, non-current | 1,983 | 319  \nObligations under finance leases, non-current | 2,856 | 2,848  \nDeferred income tax, net | 852 | 846  \nTax receivable agreement liability due to related party, non-current | 2,126 | 865  \n**Total Liabilities** | 95,312 | 68,004  \n**Commitments and Contingencies (Note 19)**  \n**Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity**  \nSeries A Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value;

This press release includes both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit margin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based compensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments. Such items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin Depot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of operations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin Depot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key measurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial results, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future operating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\n\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: \n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** RECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA(UNAUDITED)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income | $ | 2,299 | $ | 1,065 | $ | 2,421 | $ | 3,143  \nAdjustments:  \nInterest expense | 2,907 | 2,769 | 10,731 | 10,120  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 347 | 337 | 479 | (977 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,245 | 3,260 | 8,184 | 9,554  \nExpense related to the PIPE transaction (1) | — | 2,700 | — | 12,281  \nNon-recurring expenses (2) | 297 | 2,873 | 1,204 | 7,664  \nShare-based compensation | 412 | 944 | 3,037 | 1,326  \nSpecial bonus (3) | 675 | — | 675 | 3,915  \nExpenses associated with the termination of the phantom equity participation plan | — | — | — | 350  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 9,182 | $ | 13,948 | $ | 26,731 | $ | 47,376  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) | 6.8 | % | 7.8 | % | 6.1 | % | 8.8 | %  \n  \n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the recognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to the PIPE transaction.

(“Bitcoin Depot” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and link to the webcast will be made available at [ir.bitcoindepot.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EbRig5EnsAfflYexZ4TzGzL1e0x8LXWmr_-O1jWhnp0En040--xMVOnKJE4Fecw4wSjFk-oRO7Qz--AhMpXg4ky9mQ7sHSaVg-Y4DNd4800= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network while working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing our goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising locations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While this improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy is proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend to common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable legislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the Company’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet profitability.\n\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net income of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating expenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million, down 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to 16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023.

In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results.

This press release includes both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit margin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based compensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments. Such items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin Depot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of operations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin Depot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key measurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial results, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future operating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\n\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: \n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** RECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA(UNAUDITED)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income | $ | 2,299 | $ | 1,065 | $ | 2,421 | $ | 3,143  \nAdjustments:  \nInterest expense | 2,907 | 2,769 | 10,731 | 10,120  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 347 | 337 | 479 | (977 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,245 | 3,260 | 8,184 | 9,554  \nExpense related to the PIPE transaction (1) | — | 2,700 | — | 12,281  \nNon-recurring expenses (2) | 297 | 2,873 | 1,204 | 7,664  \nShare-based compensation | 412 | 944 | 3,037 | 1,326  \nSpecial bonus (3) | 675 | — | 675 | 3,915  \nExpenses associated with the termination of the phantom equity participation plan | — | — | — | 350  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 9,182 | $ | 13,948 | $ | 26,731 | $ | 47,376  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) | 6.8 | % | 7.8 | % | 6.1 | % | 8.8 | %  \n  \n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the recognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to the PIPE transaction.

(“Bitcoin Depot” or the\n“Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today\nreported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will\nhost a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and\nlink to the webcast will be made available at ir.bitcoindepot.com.\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network\nwhile working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz,\nCEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing\nour goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising\nlocations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While\nthis improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy\nis proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are\nconfident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend\nto common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in\nthe third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable\nlegislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the\nCompany’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet\nprofitability.\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023\nthat did not recur in 2024.\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net\nincome of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating\nexpenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of\n2023 that did not recur in 2024.\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million,\ndown 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a\nnon-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to\n16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2\nmillion, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecline was due to the lower revenue. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-\nGAAP Financial Measures” below.\nCash and cash equivalents were $32.2 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2024.

Forward-looking\nstatements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, and include, but are\nnot limited to, statements regarding the expectations of plans, business strategies,\nobjectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance, including our\ngrowth strategy and ability to increase deployment of our products and services, our ability\nto strengthen our financial profile, and worldwide growth in the adoption and use of\ncryptocurrencies. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current\nbeliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future\nevents. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “anticipate,”\n“appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,”\n“evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,“\n”plan,“ ”potential,“ ”priorities,“ ”project,“ ”pursue,“ ”seek,“ ”should,“ ”target,“ ”when,“ ”will,“\n”would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions that predict or indicate\nfuture events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, although not all\nforward-looking statements contain such identifying words. In making these statements, we\nrely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical\ntrends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we\nconsider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable,\nbut these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results. These\nforward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended\nto serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a\nprediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances\nare difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and\ncircumstances are beyond our control.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,\nincluding changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal\nconditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination; risks\nrelating to the uncertainty of our projected financial information; future global, regional or\nlocal economic and market conditions; the development, effects and enforcement of laws\nand regulations; our ability to manage future growth; our ability to develop new products and\nservices, bring them to market in a timely manner and make enhancements to our platform;\nthe effects of competition on our future business; our ability to issue equity or equity-linked\nsecurities; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings,\ninvestigations and inquiries; and those factors described or referenced in filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions\nprove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these\nforward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or\nthat we currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from\nthose contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements\nreflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this\npress release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our\nassessments to change.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-\nlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation\nto update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of\nnew information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statements,\nexcept where we are expressly required to do so by law. All written and oral forward-looking\nstatements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary\nstatement.\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSeptember\n30, December\n2024 31,\n(unaudited) 2023\nAssets\nCurrent:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 32,229 $ 29,759\nCryptocurrencies 1,311 712\nAccounts receivable 380 245\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 7,453 6,554\nTotal current assets 41,373 37,270\nProperty and equipment:\nFurniture and fixtures 635 635\nLeasehold improvements 172 172\nKiosk machines - owned 32,086 24,222\nKiosk machines - leased 20,004 20,524\nTotal property and equipment 52,897 45,553\nLess: accumulated depreciation (25,350) (20,699)\nTotal property and equipment, net 27,547 24,854\nIntangible assets, net 2,698 3,836\nGoodwill 8,717 8,717\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 2,814 484\nDeposits 736 412\nDeferred tax assets 3,562 1,804\nTotal assets $ 87,447 $ 77,377\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSeptember\n30, December\n2024 31,\n(unaudited) 2023\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity\nCurrent:\nAccounts payable $ 11,965 $ 8,337\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 20,196 21,545\nNotes payable, current portion 4,860 3,985\nIncome taxes payable 1,355 2,484\nDeferred revenue 201 297\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion 887 279\nCurrent installments of obligations under finance leases 3,931 6,801\nOther non-income tax payable 2,236 2,297\nTotal current liabilities 45,631 46,025\nLong-term liabilities\nNotes payable, non-current 41,864 17,101\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 1,983 319\nObligations under finance leases, non-current 2,856 2,848\nDeferred income tax, net 852 846\nTax receivable agreement liability due to related party, non-\ncurrent 2,126 865\nTotal Liabilities 95,312 68,004\nCommitments and Contingencies (Note 19)\nStockholders’ (Deficit) Equity\nSeries A Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value; 50,000,000\nauthorized, 3,075,000 and 3,125,000 shares issued and\noutstanding, at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively — —\nClass A common stock, $0.0001 par value; 800,000,000\nauthorized, 17,844,174 and 13,602,691 shares issued, and\n17,653,554 and 13,482,047 shares outstanding at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively 1 1\nClass B common stock, $0.0001 par value; 20,000,000\nauthorized, no shares issued and outstanding at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 — —\nClass E common stock, $0.0001 par value; 2,250,000\nauthorized, 1,075,761 shares issued and outstanding at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 — —\nClass M common stock, $0.0001 par value; 300,000,000\nauthorized, no shares issued and outstanding at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 — —\nClass O common stock, $0.0001 par value; 800,000,000\nauthorized, no shares issued and outstanding at September\n— —\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nClass V common stock, $0.0001 par value; 300,000,000\nauthorized, 41,193,024 and 44,100,000 shares issued and\noutstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively 4 4\nTreasury stock (437) (279)\nAdditional paid-in capital 21,135 17,326\nAccumulated deficit (37,701) (32,663)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (204) (203)\nTotal Stockholders’ (Deficit) Attributable to Bitcoin Depot\nInc.

This press release includes both\nhistorical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and\nother metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit\nmargin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax\nexpense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based\ncompensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments.\nSuch items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in\nnature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core\nresults of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less\nmeaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and\ndepreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin\nDepot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information\nto investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of\noperations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin\nDepot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key\nmeasurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those\nrelated to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial\nplanning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit\nare not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may\nexclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial\nresults, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded\nwhen calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses\nboth Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted\nEBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative\nto, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or\nperformance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future\noperating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross\nProfit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other\ncompanies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As\nsuch, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some\nof the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of\nthe excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to\nquantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no\ndisclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the\nforward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the\nperiods indicated:\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(UNAUDITED)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ 2,299 $ 1,065 $ 2,421 $ 3,143\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense 2,907 2,769 10,731 10,120\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 347 337 479 (977)\nDepreciation and amortization 2,245 3,260 8,184 9,554\nExpense related to the PIPE\ntransaction (1) — 2,700 — 12,281\nNon-recurring expenses (2) 297 2,873 1,204 7,664\nShare-based compensation\n412 944 3,037 1,326\nSpecial bonus (3) 675 — 675 3,915\nExpenses associated with the\ntermination of the phantom equity\nparticipation plan — — — 350\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 9,182 $ 13,948 $ 26,731 $ 47,376\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) 6.8% 7.8% 6.1% 8.8%\n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the\nrecognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to\nthe PIPE transaction.\n(2) Comprised of non-recurring professional service fees.\n(3) For nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes (A) Transaction bonus\nand related taxes to employees of approximately $2.3 million and (B) Founder Transaction\nbonus of approximately $1.6 million.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or the Company's future financial or operating performance, including pro forma and estimated financial information, and other \"forward-looking\nstatements\" (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995).

Instead, they are based only on the\nCompany's currentbeliefs, expectations andassumptions regarding the future ofits business,future plans andstrategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and otherfuture conditions. Because forward-\nlooking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control.

Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking\nstatements,whichspeakonly asof thedatetheyaremade.\n2\nDisclaimer\nNon-GAAP Measures: This presentation includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") including, but not limited to, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,\nAdjusted Gross Profit and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom. The Company defines (i) EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA\nfurtheradjusted bythe removalofcertainnon-recurring costsand assumed public companycosts. The Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue less costof revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization). These\nnon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing the Company's financial results. Such measures\nmay not be indicative of the Company's historical operating results nor are such measures meant to be predictive of future results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net\nincome, cashflows fromoperations orothermeasures ofprofitability, liquidity orperformance underGAAP. Youshould beaware thatthe Company's presentation ofthese measures maynotbecomparable tosimilarly-titled\nmeasuresusedbyothercompanies.Assuch,unduerelianceshouldnotbeplacedonthesenon-GAAPfinancialmeasures.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and\nresults of operations. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in and in comparing the\nCompany's financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the\nexercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to footnotes where presented on each page of this\npresentation and/or to the appendix found at the end of this presentation for more details regarding the calculations of such measures and/or for a reconciliation of these measures to what the Company believes are the\nmostdirectly comparablemeasuresevaluatedinaccordancewithGAAP.\nTrademarks and Trade Names: The Company owns or has rights to various trademarks, service marks and trade names that they use in connection with the operation of their respective businesses.
