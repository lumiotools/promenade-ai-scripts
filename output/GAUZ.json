Announces Third Quarter and Nine Months 2024 Results\n\nNovember 12, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/7176/pdf)\n\nDelivers Third Quarter Revenue Growth of 24.6% Driven by Broad-Based Strength Across Segments\n\nAnnounces Ground-Breaking Customer Wins Across All Divisions with Major OEMs\n\nAccelerating Demand, Driving Record Backlog Levels\n\nNarrows Adjusted Net Loss for the Quarter, Continuing Path to Improved Profitability\n\nReiterates Fourth Quarter 2024 Guidance Range\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel and NEW YORK, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Gauzy Ltd. (Nasdaq: GAUZ) (“Gauzy” or the “Company”)** , a global leader of vision and light control technologies, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Highlights****(Compared to****Third****Quarter 2023)**\n\n  * Revenues of $23.3 million increased 24.6% compared to $18.7 million\n  * Gross margin of 23.9% declined 290 basis points compared to 26.8%\n  * Net loss of $5.5 million compared to a net loss of $21.3 million\n  * Non-GAAP Adjusted net loss of $7.8 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $9.8 million\n  * Total available liquidity of $44.4 million, including cash of $9.4 million and $35.0 million undrawn credit facility at quarter end\n\n\n\n**Nine Months 2024 Highlights (Compared to Third Quarter 2023)**\n\n  * Revenues of $72.4 million increased 29.2% compared to $56.0 million\n  * Gross margin of 25.4% increased 100 basis points compared to 24.4%\n  * Net loss of $41.8 million compared to a net loss of $58.6 million\n  * Non-GAAP Adjusted net loss of $25.6 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $25.6 million\n\n\n\n“Our third quarter revenue was in line with our pre-announced expectations, with strong 24.6% growth reflecting our premier position as a global leader in vision and light control technologies,” commented Eyal Peso, Gauzy Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Our comprehensive capabilities, spanning from cutting-edge R&D through large-scale manufacturing, continue to drive strong demand across all our segments. We're seeing particularly robust traction in our core markets, from advanced aircraft shading systems to sophisticated transportation safety solutions and energy-efficient architectural applications.”\n\n“To meet this growing demand, we've taken decisive action by adding a second shift at our French production facility,” Mr. Peso continued. “This doubling of shifts represents a strategic advance in our ability to accelerate shipments through the dedicated efforts of our stable and resilient workforce and better position our business for improved profitability. Prior labor constraints and typical third quarter seasonality in Europe resulted in approximately $4 million of deliveries that we anticipate moving into the fourth quarter and early 2025. I’m pleased to say that we have already begun fulfilling such backlog of orders. Accelerating momentum for our innovative solutions continues to build, as reflected in our fourth quarter guidance for a step up in revenue into year-end.”\n\nMr. Peso concluded, “With Ferrari, one of the most iconic OEMs, with Yutong, the world’s largest bus manufacturer, and Ford on trucks, Gauzy serves some of the biggest and best names in the automotive industry with long-term supply agreements. They see the extraordinary value proposition that integrating our technology into their platforms represents, and their support underpins our strong growth trajectory. We are confident that investors will increasingly appreciate the intrinsic value of Gauzy, the same way that these customers and many others have entrusted us with an important part of their future growth.”\n\n**Top Q3 2024 Business Milestones and Accomplishments**\n\n  * Yutong, the world’s largest bus OEM, increased third quarter orders by 250% year-over-year, positioning Gauzy to extend its global share of buses using its Smart-Vision ADAS\n  * Signed our largest-to-date Automotive serial production deal to deliver our LCG® Smart Glass into an average of 50,000 cars per year for nine years with a major European OEM\n  * Gauzy selected by Ferrari to supply its SPD smart glass technology to support the serial production of its first ever 4-seater offering for eight years\n  * A major international airline contracts Gauzy for cabin shading with LCG® Smart Glass on Boeing 737 MAX fleet\n  * Selected by one of the largest cruise ship manufacturers to supply new terminal in Miami, Florida with over 11,000 sqft of LCG® Smart Glass Transparent Display Façade\n\n\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Results**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of $23.3 million increased 24.6% compared to $18.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by existing and new customer accounts in the Safety Tech and Architecture divisions.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of $5.6 million increased 11.5% compared to $5.0 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the third quarter decreased to 23.9% compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to mix of revenues from products and divisions.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter were $14.3 million, up 3.2% compared to $13.9 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to increases in payroll and related expenses, director related expenses, professional services and transaction expenses and selling and marketing costs, offset by decreases in materials expenses, subcontractors expenses and rent and maintenance costs. Total operating expenses include research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of $5.5 million compared to $21.3 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to a decrease in financial expenses.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted net loss for the third quarter of $7.8 million compared to $9.8 million in the prior year quarter, with the improvement primarily attributable to the adjustment of other financial expenses, net and non-cash fair value adjustments.\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024** **Segment Performance**\n\n_Safety-Tech_ _Division_ _Results_\n\nSafety-Tech revenue of $11.2 million in the third quarter increased 68.1% compared to $6.6 million in the prior year quarter on strong demand across the segment’s product lines. Gross profit of $2.1 million in the third quarter increased 39.1% compared to $1.5 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin of 19.0% in the third quarter compared to 23.0% in the prior year period, primarily attributable to product mix.\n\n_Aeronautics_ _Division_ _Results_\n\nAeronautics revenue of $7.8 million in the third quarter decreased 7.6% as compared to $8.4 million in the prior year quarter. Gross profit of $2.6 million in the third quarter decreased 15.2% as compared to $3.1 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin of 34.0% in the third quarter compared to 36.9% in the prior year period. The decrease in revenue, gross profit and gross margin reflects the shift in expected deliveries from the third quarter to coming quarters.\n\n_Architecture_ _Division_ _Results_\n\nArchitecture revenue of $3.8 million in the third quarter increased 21.0% compared to $3.2 million in the prior year quarter, growing worldwide demand. Gross profit of $1.2 million in the third quarter increased 37.2% compared to $0.9 million in the prior year quarter.

Gross loss of $0.1 million in the third quarter compared to a gross loss of $0.1 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of $44.4 million, including $9.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $35.0 million of available capacity under its undrawn credit line.

Gauzy believes that these measures provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision making. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n_Adjusted Net Loss_. The Company defines Adjusted Net Loss as Net Loss, adjusting for certain financial expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition and debt raising related costs, non-cash fair value adjustments and expenses related to equity-based compensation and doubtful debts.\n\n_EBITDA_. The Company defines EBITDA as Net Loss, excluding net financial expense, tax expense and depreciation and amortization.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding acquisition-related costs, one-time expenses and equity-based compensation expenses.\n\n_Net Loss Margin_. The Company defines Net Loss Margin as Net Loss divided by revenue.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) for the period divided by revenue for the same period.\n\nFor more information on the Non-GAAP financial measures, please see the reconciliation tables provided in this press release.

The CEOs also highlighted the significant growth opportunities ahead for smart glass, especially SPD, for passenger vehicles, architectural and aircraft applications, as well as for other new uses.\n\nSPD technology is already being utilized – and continues to gain momentum – across automotive and aeronautics – two of Gauzy’s core industries served – for several reasons. SPD offers numerous benefits for manufacturers and their end-users, including comfort and convenience, safety, aesthetics, ease of maintenance, energy-efficiency, thermal comfort and more. As a result, the [SPD smart glass market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4bm63pN9fITCetkA7SYoTzw3kfJAKAb61GPE7cypcld-lr2STSYIxiVl_XyIRgDBM6wScQktbgq-sBI7iNcMuQQja3anZ0V0t3t2sJHDdyt_H0-XDom6KnXYRtQyn_2KpQVNRONCZTmycgBg6g6Y7XzZwZTEl_txR9nX6wiXA3w=) is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 9.9% from 2024-2031, reaching $13.4 billion in value by the end of 2031.\n\nIn addition to Ferrari, numerous luxury and mass-market global automotive manufacturers have already implemented SPD smart glass into the designs of their vehicles, including McLaren, Mercedes and Cadillac, which all offer automobiles with sunroofs that contain this type of technology. This technology is also expected to be widely adopted in upcoming mass-market cars.\n\nMoreover, in aeronautics, increasing demand from aircraft manufacturers to provide passengers with better light control and comfort has led to several prominent OEMs incorporating SPD technology into the cabins on commercial airplanes, business jets and helicopters. Gauzy is currently the leading Tier 1 supplier in cabin shading in business jets, with a growing presence in commercial aircrafts, and is a trusted supplier and partner of Gulfstream, Embraer, Bombardier and others.\n\nGauzy is a strategic investor and licensee of Research Frontiers. SPD uses specially-engineered nanoparticles suspended and distributed throughout a flexible film which is laminated directly into glass or other transparent substrates, enabling the dynamic and various control of light. The technology allows up to 99% blocking of visible light to shade interiors, increases head space in vehicles by at least 5 centimeters, and can extend driving ranges in electric vehicles, all while extending visibility for increased safety and enhancing future-facing automotive designs.\n\nBenzinga All Access is a first-of-its-kind show, which features informative, in-depth conversations with company executives across a wide range of industries and asset classes.
