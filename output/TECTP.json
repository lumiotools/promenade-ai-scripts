Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\nTectonic Financial, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Texas corporation and registered financial holding company that offers, through\nits subsidiaries, banking and other financial services including trust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, factoring, third-party administration,\nrecordkeeping and insurance services to individuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States.\nWe operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. (“TBI”), which was incorporated under the laws of the State of\nTexas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the registered bank holding company for T Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the “Bank”), (ii) Sanders\nMorris LLC (“Sanders Morris”), a registered broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and registered investment advisor\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), (iii) Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic Advisors”), a registered investment advisor registered\nwith the SEC focused generally on managing money for relatively large, affiliated institutions, and (iv) HWG Insurance Agency LLC (“HWG”), an\ninsurance agency registered with the Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”).\nWe are headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Bank operates through its main office located at 16200 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas. Our other\nsubsidiaries operate from offices in Houston, Dallas and Frisco, Texas. Our Houston, Texas office is located at 600 Travis Street, 59th Floor, Houston,\nTexas, and includes the home offices of Sanders Morris and HWG, as well as Tectonic Advisors’ family office services team. Our other Dallas office,\nwhich is a branch office of Sanders Morris, is located at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 470, Dallas, Texas. The main office for Tectonic Advisors is in Frisco,\nTexas, and is located at 17 Cowboys Way, Suite 250, Frisco, Texas, and also includes a branch office of HWG.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services primarily to small- to medium-sized businesses and their\nemployees, and other institutions. The Nolan Company (“Nolan”), operating as a division within the Bank from Nolan’s office in Overland Park, Kansas,\noffers third party administration (“TPA”) services, and Integra Funding Solutions, LLC (“Integra”), also operating as a division within the Bank from\nIntegra’s office in Fort Worth, Texas, offers factoring services. The Bank’s technological capabilities, including worldwide free ATM withdrawals,\nsophisticated on-line banking capabilities, electronic funds transfer capabilities, and economical remote deposit solutions, allow most customers to be\nserved regardless of their geographic location. The Bank serves its local geographic market which includes Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, Collin and Rockwall\ncounties in Texas which encompass an area commonly referred to as the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The Bank also serves the dental and other health\nprofessional industries through a centralized loan and deposit platform that operates out of its main office in Dallas, Texas. In addition, the Bank serves\nthe small business community by offering loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(“USDA”).\nThe Bank offers a wide range of deposit services including demand deposits, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, individual retirement\naccounts, and certificates of deposit with fixed rates and a range of maturity options. Lending services include commercial loans to small- to medium-sized\nbusinesses and professional concerns as well as consumers. The Bank also offers trust services. The Bank’s traditional fiduciary services clients primarily\nconsist of clients of Cain, Watters & Associates, LLC (“Cain Watters”). The Bank, Cain Watters and Tectonic Advisors entered into an advisory services\nagreement related to the Bank’s trust operations in April 2006, which has been amended from time to time, most recently in January 2023. See Note 12 –\nRelated Parties, to these consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, the Nolan division of the Bank offers TPA services and\nprovides clients with retirement plan design and administrative services, specializing in ministerial recordkeeping, administration, actuarial and design\nservices for retirement plans of small businesses and professional practices. We believe offering TPA services allows us to serve our clients more fully\nand to attract new clients to our trust platform.\nBasis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\n(this “Form 10-Q”) include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in\nconsolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q adopted by the SEC. Accordingly, the consolidated financial\nstatements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction\nwith our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the audited financial statements included within\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments that were normal and recurring in nature, and considered necessary, have been included for the fair\npresentation of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024, are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amount of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could be significantly different from\nthose estimates. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates. The determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses, the fair value of stock options, the fair values of financial instruments and other real estate owned, and the status of contingencies are particularly\nsusceptible to significant change in recorded amounts.\nAccounting Changes, Reclassifications and Restatements. Certain items in prior financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current\npresentation but have no effect on the reported results of operations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”), effective on January 1, 2023. The guidance replaces the incurred loss\nmethodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. The CECL model requires\nthe measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures based on\nhistorical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant\nestimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13\npermits the use of estimation techniques that are practical and relevant to the Company’s circumstances, as long as they are applied consistently over\ntime and faithfully estimate expected credit losses in accordance with the standard. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available for\nsale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt\nsecurities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required to sell. Management has made a policy\nelection to exclude accrued interest receivable on available for sale securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately in\nother assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet (“OBS”) credit exposures. Results for\nreporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with\npreviously applicable incurred loss model under GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses\nof $1.4 million which was recognized through a $1.1 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of\nthe allowance for credit losses to $5.9 million as of January 1, 2023. In addition, the Company recorded a $237,505 reserve on unfunded commitments\nwhich is recorded in other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and was recognized through a $188,000 adjustment to retained\nearnings, net of tax.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been\nrecognized prior to January 1, 2023. Upon adoption, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses for debt securities was not required. At\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no allowance for credit losses - available-for-sale securities was recorded.\nASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), eliminates\nthe accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings in ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables -Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while\nenhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nAdditionally, ASU 2022-02 requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net\ninvestments in leases within the scope of ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost. The Company\nadopted ASU 2022-02 on a modified retrospective basis effective on January 1, 2023.

These investment contracts or bonds are located in Texas, California and Florida, and originate under a contractual obligation\nbetween the property owners, the local county or city administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. PACE assessments are created to fund\nthe purchase and installation of energy saving improvements to the property such as solar panels. PID/TIRZ assessments are used to pay for the\ndevelopment costs of a residential subdivision. Generally, as a property assessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32\nyears by the then current property owner(s). Each installment is collected by the County or City Tax Collector where the property is located. The\nassessments are an obligation of the property. Securities, restricted consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (“FRB”) and Federal Home Loan Bank of\nDallas (“FHLB”) stock, each of which are carried at cost.\nDuring each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no securities available for sale were sold, and there were no realized gains or\nlosses recorded on sales for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, securities available for sale with a fair value of $978,000 and $988,000, respectively, were pledged against\ntrust deposit balances held at the Bank. In March 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) created the Bank\nTerm Funding Program (“BTFP”), which was made available to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system. The BTFP\nallows the par value of available for sale securities to be included as the collateral value. As of June 30, 2024, securities with a par value of $20.1 million\nwere pledged to the Federal Reserve under the BTFP, of which $20.0 million was borrowed against. As of June 30, 2024, there were no securities pledged\nto secure borrowings at the FHLB.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank held FRB stock in the amount of $2.2 million. The Bank held FHLB stock in the amount of $2.0\nmillion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of which were classified as securities, restricted.\nThe table below indicates the length of time individual investment securities have been in a continuous loss position as of June 30, 2024:\nJune 30, 2024\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(In thousands) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ 2,938 $ 7 $ - $ - $ 2,938 $ 7\nU.S. government agencies - - 13,663 1,943 13,663 1,943\nMortgage-backed securities 2,610 34 4,235 315 6,845 349\nTotal $ 5,548 $ 41 $ 17,898 $ 2,258 $ 23,446 $ 2,299\nBeginning January 1, 2023, the Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any debt securities in a loss position require an allowance\nfor credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company had a total of twenty-four (24) investment positions in the unrealized loss position as of June\n30, 2024. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors based upon our analysis of the\nunderlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, such as bond ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and\nin consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of\ncash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the\namount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense.\nLosses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available for sale and held to maturity securities in an unrealized loss\nposition as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the\nunderlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our securities and in consideration of our historical credit\nloss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities are U.S. government agencies who continue to make timely principal and interest\npayments under the contractual terms of the securities. Furthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as\navailable for sale in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost.\nThe unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair\nvalue is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available for sale as of June 30, 2024 are presented in the table below by contractual maturity.\nExpected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.

The Bank believes that these loans are to credit worthy\nborrowers and are diversified geographically.\nAccrued interest receivable on loans totaled $3.7 million and $3.1 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in\naccrued interest receivable and other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Company serves the small business community by offering loans promulgated under the SBA’s 7(a) and 504 loan programs, and loans\nguaranteed by the USDA. SBA 7(a) and USDA loans are typically guaranteed by each agency in amounts ranging from 75% to 80% of the principal\nbalance. For SBA construction loans, the Company records the guaranteed funded portion of the loans as held for sale. When the SBA loans are fully\nfunded, the Company may sell the guaranteed portion into the secondary market, on a servicing-retained basis, or reclassify from loans held for sale to\nloans held for investment if the Company determines that holding these loans provide better long-term risk adjusted returns than selling the loans. In\ncalculating gain on the sale of loans, the Company performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portion of the\nloan. The Company’s assumptions are validated by reference to external market information.\nThe Company had $47.9 million and $26.6 million of SBA/USDA loans held for sale as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no sales of loans. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company sold the guaranteed\nportion of one USDA loan totaling $5.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of loans of $581,000. There were no loan sales during the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company elected to reclassify $29.4 million of the SBA 7(a) loans held for sale to\nloans held for investment.\nLoan Origination/Risk Management.\nThe Company maintains written loan origination policies, procedures, and processes which address credit quality within an acceptable level of risk at\nseveral levels including individual loan level, loan type, and loan portfolio levels.\nCommercial and industrial loans, which are predominantly loans to dentists, are underwritten based on historical and projected income of the\nbusiness and individual borrowers and guarantors. The Company utilizes a comprehensive global debt service coverage analysis to determine debt\nservice coverage ratios. This analysis compares global cash flow of the borrowers and guarantors on an individual credit to existing and proposed debt\nafter consideration of personal and business-related other expenses. Collateral is generally a lien on all available assets of the business borrower\nincluding intangible assets. Credit worthiness of individual borrowers and guarantors is established through the use of credit reports and credit scores.\nConsumer loans are evaluated on the basis of credit worthiness as established through the use of credit reports and credit scores. Additional credit\nquality indicators include borrower debt to income ratios based on verifiable income sources.\nReal estate mortgage loans are evaluated based on collateral value as well as global debt service coverage ratios based on historical and projected\nincome from all related sources including the collateral property, the borrower, and all guarantors where applicable.\nThe Company originates SBA loans which are sometimes sold into the secondary market. The Company continues to service these loans after sale\nand is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts. The two primary SBA loan programs that the Company offers are the basic SBA 7(a)\nloan guaranty program and the SBA 504 loan program in conjunction with junior lien financing from a Certified Development Company (“CDC”). The SBA\nhas designated the Bank as a “Preferred Lender.” As an SBA Preferred Lender, the Bank has been delegated loan approval, closing and most servicing\nand liquidation authority from the SBA.\nThe SBA 7(a) program serves as the SBA’s primary business loan program to help qualified small businesses obtain financing when they might not\nbe eligible for business loans through normal lending channels. Loan proceeds under this program can be used for most business purposes including\nworking capital, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, land and building (including purchase, renovation and new construction), leasehold\nimprovements and debt refinancing. Loan maturity is generally up to 10 years for non-real estate collateral and up to 25 years for real estate collateral. The\nSBA 7(a) loan is approved and funded by a qualified lender, partially guaranteed by the SBA and subject to applicable regulations. In general, the SBA\nguarantees up to 75% of the loan amount depending on loan size. The Company is required by the SBA to service the loan and retain a contractual\nminimum of 5% on all SBA 7(a) loans, but generally retains 25% (the unguaranteed portion). The servicing spread is 1% of the guaranteed portion of the\nloan that is sold in the secondary market. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of loans that we sold in the secondary market yet\nretained the servicing of such loans was $37.6 million and $37.9 million, respectively.\nThe SBA 504 program is an economic development-financing program providing long-term, low down payment loans to businesses. Typically, a 504\nproject includes a loan secured from a private-sector lender with a senior lien, a loan secured from a CDC (funded by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture)\nwith a junior lien covering up to 40% of the total cost, and a contribution of at least 10% equity from the borrower. Debenture limits are $5.0 million for\nregular 504 loans and $5.5 million for those 504 loans that meet a public policy goal.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also offers Business & Industry (“B&I”) program loans through the USDA. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they\nare guaranteed by the USDA. The guaranteed amount is generally 80%. B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally\nlarger loans to larger businesses than the SBA 7(a) loans. Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market. These loans can be\nutilized for rural commercial real estate and equipment. The loans can have maturities up to 30 years and the rates can be fixed or variable.\nConstruction and land development loans are evaluated based on the borrower’s and guarantor’s credit worthiness, past experience in the industry,\ntrack record and experience with the type of project being considered, and other factors. Collateral value is determined generally by independent appraisal\nutilizing multiple approaches to determine value based on property type.\nThe Bank engages in third-party factoring of certain business’s accounts receivable invoices. The Bank’s factoring clients are primarily in the\ntransportation industry. Each account debtor is credit qualified, confirming credit worthiness and stability, because the underlying debtor represents the\nsubstantive underlying credit risk. Some factored receivables are full recourse to and personally guaranteed by the factoring client. In such cases, the\nclient is credit qualified under specific policy guidelines. Concentration limits are set and monitored for aggregate factored receivables, account debtors,\nand individual factoring clients. In addition, we consider the overall state of each specific industry, currently over-the-road trucking, in our evaluation of\nthe credit worthiness of the factoring client and the underlying debtor.\nFor all loan types, the Company establishes guidelines for its underwriting criteria including collateral coverage ratios, global debt service coverage\nratios, and maximum amortization or loan maturity terms.\nAt the portfolio level, the Company monitors concentrations of loans based on several criteria including loan type, collateral type, industry,\ngeography, and other factors. The Company also performs periodic market research and economic analysis at a local geographic and national level. Based\non this research, the Company may from time to time change the minimum or benchmark underwriting criteria applied to the above loan types.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of the Company’s management, the borrower may be unable to meet payment\nobligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or\nnot such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. A loan may be returned to accrual\nstatus when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are\nreasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower.\nNon-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, were as follows as of the dates indicated:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNon-Accrual Non-Accrual\nwith with\nTotal No Credit Loss Total No Credit Loss\n(In thousands) Non-Accrual Allowance Non-Accrual Allowance\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,470 $ 1,783 $ - $ -\nReal estate - residential 122 122 221 221\nSBA guaranteed 6,245 6,245 1,951 1,951\nSBA unguaranteed 1,780 1,121 251 251\nTotal $ 10,617 $ 9,271 $ 2,423 $ 2,423\nThe Company did not recognize any interest income on non-accrual loans during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFrom time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result\nin new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of a principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a combination thereof, among other things. During the six months ended June 30, 2024,\nthere were no loan modifications of significance. There were no loans that were modified due to the borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the\npreceding twelve months that were past due for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n14\nTable of Contents\nUnder ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net\namount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. The\nCompany’s allowance for credit losses for loans consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically\nidentified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical credit loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk\nfactors both internal and external to the Company.\nThe Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected\nin order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. In setting the\nspecific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to\neach loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans, which along with the delinquency list of loans,\nhelps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified\nas impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company\nallocates a specific reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the loan or when the discounted cash flows for the loan is lower than\nthe carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management’s assessment, the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit\nlosses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the\nsale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis.\nIn determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical lifetime credit loss experience,\nconcentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company’s loan portfolio, current economic conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower’s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the\nCompany’s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and\nexternal to the Company and other relevant factors in accordance with ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.” Historical lifetime credit\nloss experience is determined by utilizing an open-pool (“cumulative loss rate”) methodology. Adjustments to the historical lifetime credit loss experience\nare made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations, delinquency, non-accrual, and watch list levels, as well\nas changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates, property and collateral values, and other indices relating to\neconomic activity. The utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates. For all loan\npools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over two years\non a straight-line basis. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance\nof each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not\npreclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.\nAdjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics.\nCollateral dependent loans are secured by real estate assets, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. For a collateral dependent loan, the\nCompany’s evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted for selling costs, when appropriate. This valuation is\ncompared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be probable, the loss is included in the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans as a specific allocation.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank had no collateral-dependent loans as of June 30, 2024.

Loans are graded in one of six categories: (i) pass, (ii)\npass-watch, (iii) special mention, (iv) substandard, (v) doubtful, or (vi) loss. Loans graded as loss are charged-off.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. The Company reviews the ratings on\ncredits quarterly. No significant changes were made to the loan risk grading system definitions and allowance for credit loss methodology during the past\nyear. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be inherent in each credit. The guaranteed portion of SBA loans that are\nclassified are included in the pass category. The Company’s methodology is structured so that specific allocations are increased in accordance with\ndeterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a\ncorresponding decrease in risk and loss).\nCredits rated pass are acceptable loans, appropriately underwritten, bearing an ordinary risk of loss to the Company. Loans in this category are loans\nto highly credit worthy borrowers with financial statements presenting a good primary source as well as an adequate secondary source of repayment.\nCredits rated pass-watch loans have been determined to require enhanced monitoring for potential weaknesses which require further investigation.\nThey have no significant delinquency in the past twelve months. This rating causes the loan to be actively monitored with greater frequency than pass\nloans and allows appropriate downgrade transition if verifiable adverse events are confirmed. This category may also include loans that have improved in\ncredit quality from special mention but are not yet considered pass loans.\nCredits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness; however, such concerns are not so\npronounced that the Company generally expects to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform\nwithin standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits rated more harshly.\nCredits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse\ntrends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these\ncredits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to strengthen the Company’s position, and/or to reduce exposure and to\nassure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the\nsecondary support to the credit is performed. Guaranteed portions of SBA loans graded substandard are generally on non-accrual due to the limited\namount of interest covered by the guarantee, usually 60 days maximum. However, there typically will be no exposure to loss on the principal amount of\nthese guaranteed portions of the loan.\nCredits rated doubtful are those in which full collection of principal appears highly questionable, and which some degree of loss is anticipated, even\nthough the ultimate amount of loss may not yet be certain and/or other factors exist which could affect collection of debt. Based upon available\ninformation, positive action by the Company is required to avert or minimize loss.\nLoans classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This\nclassification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off\nthis asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of loans by year of origination and internal ratings as of June 30, 2024:\nTerm Loans by Origination Year\nRevolving\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Loans Total\nCommercial and industrial\nPass $ 3,166 $ 12,147 $ 22,727 $ 15,563 $ 7,249 $ 12,185 $ 2,206 $ 75,243\nPass-watch -

Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was approximately $853,000 and $1.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $839,000 and $2.1\nmillion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective income tax rate was 21.3% and 21.5% for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and 21.7% and 21.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate is\naffected by the income tax effects of nondeductible expenses related to stock options among other things.\nNet deferred tax assets totaled $1.2 million and $889,000 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company files U.S. federal and\nstate income tax returns.\nNote 10. Stock Compensation Plans\nThe Company’s board of directors and common stock shareholders adopted the Tectonic Financial, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) in\nMay 2017 in connection with the Company’s acquisition of TBI. The Plan was amended and restated by the Company’s board of directors and common\nstock shareholders effective March 27, 2019 in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. The Plan is administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Company’s board of directors and authorizes the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted\nstock units to employees, directors and consultants in order to promote the success of the Company’s business. Incentive stock options may be granted\nonly to employees of the Company, or a parent or subsidiary of the Company. The Company reserved 750,000 authorized shares of common stock for the\nPlan. The term of each stock option is no longer than 10 years from the date of the grant.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation plans using the fair value-based method of accounting. The fair value of each stock\noption award is estimated on the date of grant by a third party using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model. The fair value of each grant\naward was estimated on the date of grant by a third party using the market approach based on the application of latest 12-month Company metrics to\nguideline public company multiples.\nOn September 27, 2021, 40,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company with an exercise price of $10.00 per share and an intrinsic value of $6.92 per\nshare were granted with a contract life through December 31, 2021. Sanders Morris issued a full recourse secured promissory note at the time of the grant.\nThese shares of restricted stock vested immediately, and were exercised on October 29, 2021, with the grantees utilizing the proceeds of the promissory\nnote from Sanders Morris to fund the exercise price. This note receivable is recognized within a contra-equity account, with payments by the grantees\nreducing this balance as they occur. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under this note receivable. The\nshares were subject to a right of repurchase by the Company under certain circumstances, which right expired on December 31, 2023.\nThere were no stock options exercised, granted, vested, or forfeited during each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe number of options outstanding at each of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 167,500, and the weighted average exercise price at each of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $5.51. The weighted average contractual life as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 2.87 years and 3.37\nyears, respectively. Stock options outstanding at the end of the period had immaterial aggregate intrinsic values. The weighted-average grant date fair\nvalue of the options at each of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $1.98.\nAs of June 30, 2024, all 167,500 stock options outstanding were vested, and there was no unrecognized compensation cost. The Company recorded\ncompensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, and for the 40,000 shares of restricted stock granted September 27, 2021, over the\nright of repurchase period. The Company recorded no salaries and employee benefits expense on our consolidated statements of income in connection\nwith the Plan for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and recorded expense of $20,000 and $40,000 for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023, respectively, related to the stock options.\nThe Company granted restricted stock awards totaling 210,000 shares of common stock on September 30, 2020. The vesting schedules vary by award,\nwith all of the awards vesting over a three-year period from 2023 through 2025.\nAs of June 30, 2024, 78,000 awarded shares of restricted stock were outstanding, and the grant date fair value was $4.81. None of the outstanding\nrestricted stock awards were vested as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The weighted average contractual life as of June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 was 0.68 years and 1.18 years, respectively. The Company is recording compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting\nperiods. The Company recorded salaries and employee benefits expense on our consolidated statements of income in connection with the Plan of\napproximately $21,000 and $42,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $55,000 and $110,000 for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023, respectively, related to the restricted stock awards. As of June 30, 2024, there was $56,000 of unrecognized compensation cost\nrelated to the restricted stock awards.\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit\nloss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is\nrepresented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional\nobligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe following table summarizes loan commitments as of the dates indicated:\n(In thousands) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUndisbursed loan commitments $ 66,836 $ 45,743\nStandby letters of credit 162 162\nTotal $ 66,998 $ 45,905\nAllowance For Credit Losses – Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a\nliability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to\ncredit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation.\nOff-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in the table\nabove. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur, and the amount expected to\nbe funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are\nbased on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments\nexpected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same\nmethodology as described for loans in Note 4 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded.\n25\nTable of Contents\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet commitments for the periods indicated.\nThree months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 336 $ 273 $ 192 $ -\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 - - - 238\nProvision for off-balance sheet credit losses 38 (25) 182 10\nEnding balance $ 374 $ 248 $ 374 $ 248\nThe Company is involved in various regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to\ntime in the ordinary course of business. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that\nan unfavorable resolution of these matters, will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The\nCompany’s regular practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal matters, and to accrue for liabilities when payment is\nprobable.\nThe Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sanders Morris, has uncommitted financing arrangements with clearing brokers that finance its\ncustomer accounts, certain broker-dealer balances, and firm trading positions. Although these customer accounts and broker-dealer balances are not\nreflected on the consolidated balance sheets for financial reporting purposes, Sanders Morris has generally agreed to indemnify these clearing brokers for\nlosses they may sustain in connection with the accounts, and therefore, retains risk on these accounts. Sanders Morris is required to maintain certain\ncash or securities on deposit with its clearing brokers. Deposits with clearing organizations were $250,000 at each of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 12. Related Parties\nAdvisors’ service agreements: In January 2006, the Company entered into a services agreement (the “Tectonic Advisors-CWA Services Agreement”)\nwith Cain Watters. The owners of Cain Watters together hold approximately 30% of the voting ownership in the Company. Under the Tectonic Advisors-\nCWA Services Agreement, Cain Watters pays the Company for due diligence and research services on investment alternatives available to Cain Watters’\nclients. The Company earned $75,000 and $121,000 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $28,000 and $53,000 for the\nthree and six months June 30, 2023, respectively, under the Tectonic Advisors-CWA Services Agreement. These fees are included in investment advisory\nand other related services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company had $195,000 and $95,000 in fees payable related to\nthese services at each of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCWA Fee Allocation Agreement: In January 2006, Tectonic Advisors entered into an agreement (the “Fee Allocation Agreement”) with Cain Watters\nwith reference to its advisory agreement with the Bank. Tectonic Advisors had $217,000 and $215,000 payable to Cain Watters related to this agreement at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, certain officers, directors and their affiliated companies had depository accounts with the Bank totaling\napproximately $5.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively. None of those deposit accounts have terms more favorable than those available to any other\ndepositor. There were no loans outstanding to directors of the Bank or their affiliated companies as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 13. Regulatory Matters\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material effect on the Bank’s and, accordingly, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of\nthe Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under GAAP, regulatory reporting requirements, and regulatory capital\nstandards. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings\nand other factors. Furthermore, the Bank’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in these financial statements.\n26\nTable of Contents\nQuantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain\nminimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital to total\nrisk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets. To be categorized as “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework, the\nBank must maintain (i) a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%; and (iv) a CET1\nrisk-based capital ratio of 6.5%.\nThe Basel III minimum capital ratio requirements and additional capital conservation buffers as applicable to the Company and the Bank as of June\n30, 2024 are summarized in the table below.\nBASEL III BASEL III BASEL III\nMinimum for Additional Ratio with\nCapital Capital Capital\nAdequacy Conservation Conservation\nRequirements Buffer Buffer\nTotal Risk Based Capital (total capital to risk weighted assets) 8.0% 2.5% 10.5%\nTier 1 Risk Based Capital (tier 1 to risk weighted assets) 6.0% 2.5% 8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk Based (CET1 to risk weighted assets) 4.5% 2.5% 7.0%\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio (tier 1 to average assets) 4.0% -% 4.0%\nAccordingly, a financial institution may be considered “well-capitalized” under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework, but not satisfy the\nbuffered Basel III capital ratios. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met the definition of “well-capitalized” under the applicable\nregulations of the Federal Reserve and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the capital conservation buffer and the levels established for\n“well-capitalized” institutions under the FDIC’s regulatory framework for prompt corrective action and the Basel III capital guidelines.\nThe regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank are as follows as of the dates indicated:\nMinimum Capital Required–- Required to be Considered Well\nActual Basel III Capitalized\n(In thousands, except percentages) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of June 30, 2024\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets)\nTectonic Financial, Inc.

Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid. Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the\neffect of dividends declared (including those on the Series A preferred stock) would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank and/or the Company to fall\nbelow specified minimum levels. Approval is also required if dividends declared exceed the net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits\nfor the preceding two years. As of June 30, 2024, approximately $28.5 million was available for the declaration of dividends by the Bank to the Company\nwithout prior approval of regulatory agencies and still maintain its “well-capitalized” status. In addition, as a Texas corporation, we are restricted under\nthe Texas Business Organizations Code from paying dividends under certain conditions. Under Texas law, we cannot pay dividends to shareholders if the\ndividends exceed our surplus or if after giving effect to the dividends, we would be insolvent.\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the regulatory\nframework applicable to registered investment advisors under the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, and additionally, Sanders Morris is\nregulated by FINRA, which, among other requirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital.\nNote 14. Operating Segments\nThe Company’s reportable segments consist of “Banking,” “Other Financial Services,” and “HoldCo” operations.\nThe “Banking” segment consists of operations relative to the Company’s full service banking operations, including providing depository and\nlending services to individual and business customers, and other related banking services, along with services provided through the factoring operations\nof the Bank’s Integra division.\nThe “Other Financial Services” segment includes managed and directed brokerage, investment advisory services, including related trust company\noperations, third party administration, and life and disability insurance brokerage services to both individuals and businesses.\nThe “HoldCo” operations include the operations and subordinated debt held at the Bank’s immediate parent, as well as the activities of the financial\nholding company which serves as TBI’s parent.\nThe tables below present the financial information for each segment that is specifically identifiable, or based on allocations using internal methods,\nfor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 15,627 $ - $ - $ 15,627\nTotal interest expense 7,473 - 322 7,795\nProvision for credit losses 1,660 - - 1,660\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 6,494 - (322) 6,172\nNon-interest income 388 10,354 - 10,742\nDepreciation and amortization expense 102 8 3 113\nAll other non-interest expense 5,116 6,495 1,191 12,802\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 1,664 $ 3,851 $ (1,516) $ 3,999\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,344 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,694\nTotal assets $ 763,652 $ 12,815 $ 640 $ 777,107\n28\nTable of Contents\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 29,925 $ - $ - $ 29,925\nTotal interest expense 14,347 - 644 14,991\nProvision for credit losses 2,577 - - 2,577\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 13,001 - (644) 12,357\nNon-interest income 752 20,488 - 21,240\nDepreciation and amortization expense 204 17 5 226\nAll other non-interest expense 10,083 12,988 2,392 25,463\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 3,466 $ 7,483 $ (3,041) $ 7,908\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,344 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,694\nTotal assets $ 763,652 $ 12,815 $ 640 $ 777,107\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2023\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 11,254 $ - $ - $ 11,254\nTotal interest expense 4,149 - 282 4,431\nProvision for credit losses 691 - - 691\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 6,414 - (282) 6,132\nNon-interest income 376 9,056 - 9,432\nDepreciation and amortization expense 102 9 - 111\nAll other non-interest expense 4,207 6,638 748 11,593\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 2,481 $ 2,409 $ (1,030) $ 3,860\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,554 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,904\nTotal assets $ 608,982 $ 12,042 $ 1,024 $ 622,048\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2023\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 22,167 $ - $ - $ 22,167\nTotal interest expense 7,754 - 547 8,301\nProvision for credit losses 770 - - 770\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 13,643 - (547) 13,096\nNon-interest income 1,261 18,873 - 20,134\nDepreciation and amortization expense 198 25 - 223\nAll other non-interest expense 8,209 13,544 1,396 23,149\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 6,497 $ 5,304 $ (1,943) $ 9,858\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,554 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,904\nTotal assets $ 608,982 $ 12,042 $ 1,024 $ 622,048\n29\nTable of Contents\nNote 15. Fair Value of Financials Instruments\nThe fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction\noccurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. In estimating fair value, the\nCompany utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. Such valuation\ntechniques are consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n● Level 1 Inputs–- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability\nto access at the measurement date.\n● Level 2 Inputs–- Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as\ninterest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market\ndata by correlation or other means.\n● Level 3 Inputs–- Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions\nabout the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\nWhere quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market\nprices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing\nservices and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves,\ninterest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation\nhierarchy. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company has no\nsecurities in the Level 1 or Level 3 inputs.\nThe following table summarizes securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated by the level of the valuation\ninputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value, as of the dates indicated:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In thousands) Inputs Inputs Inputs Fair Value\nAs of June 30, 2024\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ - $ 2,938 $ - $ 2,938\nU.S. government agencies - 13,663 - 13,663\nMortgage-backed securities - 6,845 - 6,845\nAs of December 31, 2023\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ - $ 3,894 $ - $ 3,894\nU.S. government agencies - 13,627 - 13,627\nMortgage-backed securities - 5,456 - 5,456\nMarket valuations of our investment securities which are classified as level 2 are provided by an independent third party. The fair values are\ndetermined by using several sources for valuing fixed income securities. Their techniques include pricing models that vary based on the type of asset\nbeing valued and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, the market valuation sources\ninclude observable market inputs and are therefore considered Level 2 inputs for purposes of determining the fair values.\nThe Company considers transfers between the levels of the hierarchy to be recognized at the end of related reporting periods. During the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no assets for which fair value is measured on a recurring basis transferred between any levels of the hierarchy.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCertain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair\nvalue on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\nFinancial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the reported periods include impaired loans and loans held for sale.\nCollateral dependent loan. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent\nloans primarily relate to the specialized discounting criteria applied to the borrower’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount\ndepends upon the condition and marketability of the collateral, as well as other factors which may affect the collectability of the loan. As the Company’s\nprimary objective in the event of default would be to liquidate the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, collateral that is less marketable\nwould receive a larger discount. During the reported periods, there was no allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans.\nThe valuation of our not readily marketable investment securities which are classified as Level 3 are based on the Company’s own assumptions and\ninputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement, and are unobservable.\nOur assessment of the significance of a particular input to the Level 3 fair value measurements in their entirety requires judgment and considers\nfactors specific to the assets. It is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated fair value for instruments measured using Level 3 inputs could occur\nin the future.\nLoans held for sale. Loans held for sale include the guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans and are reported at the lower of cost or estimated fair\nvalue. Fair value for SBA and USDA loans is based on market indications available in the market. There were no impairments reported for the periods\npresented.\nNon-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the reported periods include other real estate owned which, upon initial\nrecognition, was re-measured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, foreclosed assets which,\nsubsequent to their initial recognition, are re-measured at fair value through a write-down included in other non-interest expense. Regulatory guidelines\nrequire the Company to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. The fair value of foreclosed assets, upon initial\nrecognition and impairment, are re-measured using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data. Estimated fair value of other real estate is based on\nappraisals. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there\nwere no foreclosed assets. There were no foreclosed assets re-measured during each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value\non a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are described as follows:\nCarrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, restricted securities, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest\npayable. The estimated fair value of demand and savings deposits is the carrying amount since rates are regularly adjusted to market rates and amounts\nare payable on demand. For borrowed funds and variable rate loans or deposits that re-price frequently and fully, the estimated fair value is the carrying\namount. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent re-pricing, fair value is based on discounted cash flows\nusing current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. For loans held for sale, the estimated fair value is based on market indications for\nsimilar assets in the active market. The estimated fair value of other financial instruments and off-balance-sheet loan commitments approximate cost and\nare not considered significant to this presentation.\nThe Company adds a servicing asset when loans are sold and the servicing is retained, and uses the amortization method for the treatment of the\nservicing asset. The servicing asset is carried at lower of cost or fair value. Loan servicing assets do not trade in an active, open market with readily\nobservable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model having significant inputs of discount rate, prepayment speed\nand default rate. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. During the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024, there was no sale of loans. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company added servicing assets totaling $38,000 in\nconnection with the sale of a $5.8 million USDA loan. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reversed $38,000 of valuation allowance for\nthe servicing assets (recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024). There was no allowance provision for servicing assets for each of the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023.\n31\nTable of Contents\nFASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial\nassets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The estimated fair value\napproximates carrying value for cash and cash equivalents and accrued interest. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities that\nare not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are discussed below.\nSecurities held to maturity. The securities in this category include PACE and PID/TIRZ investments. These investment contracts or bonds originate\nunder a contractual obligation between the property owners, the local county administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. The fair value\nof these investments are estimated using observable market inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis.\nLoans. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit\nrisk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the\ncurrent interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality.\nDeposits. The fair values of demand deposits, savings deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand and, therefore,\napproximate their carrying amounts. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that utilizes interest rates\ncurrently being offered on time deposits with similar contractual maturities.\nBorrowed Funds. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for short-term borrowings. The fair value of long-term fixed-rate borrowings is\nestimated using quoted market prices, if available, or by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments. The\nestimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that reprice quarterly.\nLoan Commitments, Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit. Our lending commitments have variable interest rates and “escape” clauses if the\ncustomer’s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the following table.\nCarrying amounts and estimated fair values of other financial instruments by level of valuation input were as follows as of the dates indicated:\nJune 30, 2024\nCarrying Estimated\n(In thousands) Amount Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 68,260 $ 68,260\nLevel 2 inputs:\nSecurities available for sale 23,446 23,446\nSecurities, restricted 4,229 4,229\nLoans held for sale 47,917 52,203\nAccrued interest receivable 4,527 4,527\nLevel 3 inputs:\nSecurities held to maturity 23,054 23,097\nLoans, net 567,367 558,337\nServicing asset 290 290\nFinancial liabilities:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nNon-interest bearing deposits 63,671 63,671\nLevel 2 inputs:\nInterest bearing deposits 555,412 556,197\nBorrowed funds 20,000 20,000\nSubordinated notes 12,000 12,000\nAccrued interest payable 1,597 1,597\n32\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying Estimated\n(In thousands) Amount Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 58,767 $ 58,767\nLevel 2 inputs:\nSecurities available for sale 22,977 22,977\nSecurities, restricted 4,176 4,176\nLoans held for sale 26,573 28,671\nAccrued interest receivable 4,829 4,829\nLevel 3 inputs:\nSecurities held to maturity 24,194 23,849\nLoans, net 494,787 484,848\nServicing asset 321 321\nFinancial liabilities:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nNon-interest bearing deposits 68,433 68,433\nLevel 2 inputs:\nInterest bearing deposits 458,458 459,549\nBorrowed funds 21,000 21,000\nSubordinated notes 12,000 12,000\nAccrued interest payable 913 913\nNote 16.

with the other cautionary statements included in this Form\n10-Q and the risk factors set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K. Due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks, the Company can give no assurance\nthat the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such\nforward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement reflects only information known to us as of the date on which it is made and we do not\nundertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such\nstatement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is\nnot possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or\ncombination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nOther Available Information\nWe file or furnish with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports required\nby Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

In\naddition, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other reports required by\nSection 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available through our website, www.t.financial, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file\nsuch material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.\nThe Company routinely posts important information for investors on its website, www.t.financial. The Company intends to use its website as a\nmeans of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure).\nAccordingly, investors should monitor the Company’s website, in addition to following the Company’s press releases, SEC filings, public conference\ncalls, presentations and webcasts.\nOur website and the information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this Form\n10-Q.\n35\nTable of Contents\nGeneral\nWe are a Texas corporation and registered financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. We provide a wide array of financial products\nand services including banking, trust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, third party administration, qualified plan recordkeeping and insurance\nservices to individuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States.\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and our\nconsolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our\nfinancial statements and the notes related thereto in this Form 10-Q and in the audited financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nWe operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. (“TBI”), which was incorporated under the laws of the State of\nTexas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the registered bank holding company for T Bank, N.A. a national banking association (the “Bank”), (ii) Sanders\nMorris LLC (“Sanders Morris”), a registered broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and registered investment\nadvisor with the SEC, (iii) Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic Advisors”), a registered investment advisor registered with the SEC focused generally on\nmanaging money for relatively large, affiliated institutions, and (iv) HWG Insurance Agency LLC (“HWG”), an insurance agency registered with the Texas\nDepartment of Insurance (“TDI”).\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare consolidated financial statements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and to customary\npractices within the financial services industry. These policies, in certain areas, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other\nfactors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions\nabout matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have\nused for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period,\ncould have a material impact on the financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–- Credit Losses (Topic 326) (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments, effective on January 1, 2023, pursuant to the delayed adoption allowable for smaller reporting companies, and replaces allowance\nallocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables, and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450,\nContingencies discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K. Upon adoption of the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology, the Company recorded an\nincrease of $1.4 million to the allowance for credit losses for loans and $237,505 to the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments. In addition,\nthe Company recognized a cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling $1.3 million, net of a recorded deferred tax asset of $341,662. See the\ndiscussion in Note 1–- Organization and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3–- Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes\nto the Company’s consolidated financial statements for more details on the impact of the Company’s adoption of the CECL methodology, including related\naccounting policies.\nPerformance Summary\nNet income available to common shareholders increased $125,000, or 4.7%, to $2.76 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to\n$2.63 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.38 and $0.36 for the three months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Net income available to common shareholders decreased $1.5 million, or 22.0%, to $5.43 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2024, compared to $6.96 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.75 and $0.95 for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily\nthe result of a $1.0 million increase in net interest income and a $1.3 million increase in non-interest income, partly offset by a $969,000 increase in the\nprovision for credit losses, a $1.2 million increase in non-interest expense and a $14,000 increase in income tax expense. The decrease in net income\navailable to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a $1.8 million increase in the provision for credit\nlosses and a $2.3 million increase in non-interest expense, partly offset by a $1.1 million increase in net interest income, a $1.1 million increase in non-\ninterest income and a $422,000 decrease in income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\n36\nTable of Contents\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, annual return on average assets was 1.61%, compared to 1.95% for the same period in the prior year, and\nannual return on average equity was 11.59%, compared to 12.08% for the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, annual\nreturn on average assets was 1.64%, compared to 2.42% for the same period in the prior year, and annual return on average equity was 11.57%, compared\nto 15.76% for the same period in the prior year.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, this Form 10-Q contains\nfinancial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, which includes return on average tangible common equity. We\ncalculate return on average tangible common equity as net income available to common shareholders (net income less dividends paid on preferred stock)\ndivided by average tangible common equity. We calculate average tangible common equity as average shareholders’ equity less average goodwill,\naverage core deposit intangible and average preferred stock. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity is\naverage total shareholders’ equity. We believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and\nratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures\nand ratios in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures\nand ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, measures and ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents non-GAAP reconciliations of annual return on average tangible common equity as of and for the periods indicated:\nAs of and As of and As of and As of and\nfor the for the for the for the\nThree Months Three Months Six Months Six Months\n(Dollars in thousands) Ended June 30, 2024 Ended June 30, 2023 Ended June 30, 2024 Ended June 30, 2023\nIncome available to common shareholders (a) $ 2,758 $ 2,633 $ 5,431 $ 6,959\nAverage shareholders’ equity $ 109,136 $ 100,331 $ 107,842 $ 98,950\nLess: average goodwill 21,440 21,440 21,440 21,440\nLess: average core deposit intangible 288 498 314 524\nLess: average preferred stock 17,250 17,250 17,250 17,250\nAverage tangible common equity (b) $ 70,158 $ 61,143 $ 68,838 $ 59,736\nAnnual return on average tangible common equity (a)/(b) 15.81% 17.27% 15.87% 23.49%\nTotal assets increased $99.8 million, or 14.7%, to $777.1 million as of June 30, 2024, from $677.3 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was\nprimarily due to increases of $72.6 million in loans held for investment, $21.3 million in loans held for sale and $9.5 million in cash and cash equivalents,\noffset by decreases of $3.3 million in other assets and $1.1 million in securities held to maturity. Substantially all loans are secured by specific collateral,\nincluding business assets, consumer assets, and commercial real estate.\nShareholders’ equity increased $3.5 million, or 3.3%, to $110.4 million as of June 30, 2024, from $106.9 million as of December 31, 2023. See the analysis\nof shareholders’ equity in the section captioned “Capital Resources and Regulatory Capital Requirements” included below.\nResults of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nDetails of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing\ncash, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume\nand spread, and are reflected in net interest margin, as well as changes in average interest rates. Volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities. Margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, and is influenced by the level and relative mix\nof interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the changes in net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of interest-\nearning assets and interest–bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in\nnet interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average\ninterest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each.\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 vs June 30, 2023\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to Change in\nAverage\n((IInn tthhoouussaannddss)) RRaattee VVoolluummee TToottaall\nInterest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold $ 44 $ 807 $ 851\nSecurities (16) 22 6\nLoans, net of unearned discount (1) 1,090 2,426 3,516\nTotal earning assets 1,118 3,255 4,373\nSavings and interest-bearing demand (1) (2) (3)\nMoney market deposit accounts 195 298 493\nTime deposits 887 1,701 2,588\nFHLB and other borrowings (2) 248 246\nSubordinated notes 40 - 40\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 1,119 2,245 3,364\nChanges in net interest income $ (1) $ 1,010 $ 1,009\n(1) Average loans include non-accrual.\nNet interest income increased $1.0 million, or 14.8%, from $6.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 to $7.8 million for the three months\nended June 30, 2024. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increases in the average volume of and yield on loans and an increase in the\naverage volume of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). The impact of these items was\npartly offset by increases in the average volume and cost of time deposits. Net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was\n4.22% and 4.73%, respectively, a decrease of 51 basis points.\nThe average volume of interest-earning assets increased $167.3 million, or 28.9%, from $578.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, to\n$746.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL\nmethodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as off-balance\nsheet credit exposures. Provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses for various\ntypes of financial instruments to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb expected credit losses over\nthe lives of the respective financial instruments. Management actively monitors the Company’s asset quality and provides appropriate provisions based\non such factors as historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nFinancial instruments are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best\ninformation available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, forecasted economic conditions continue to remain uncertain\ndue to the continued elevated interest rate environment and persistent inflationary pressures in the United States and our market areas. Accordingly,\nfuture provisions to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the\ndetermination.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the components of provision for credit losses for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProvision for credit losses related to:\nLoans $ 1,622 $ 717 $ 2,395 $ 760\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures 38 (26) 182 10\nTotal $ 1,660 $ 691 $ 2,577 $ 770\nProvision expense for loans is generally reflective of change in loan volume and mix as well as charge-offs or specific reserves taken during the\nrespective period. Provision expense is also impacted by the economic outlook and changes in macroeconomic variables. The provision expense recorded\nfor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by increased loan volume and required specific reserves. See “Allowance for Credit Losses,”\nbelow, for further analysis of our provision for credit losses related to loans.\nChanges in the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures are generally driven by the remaining unfunded loan commitments expected to fund\nloans and to changes in the assumptions to project loss rates.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe components of non-interest income were as follows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTrust income $ 1,843 $ 1,586 $ 3,582 $ 3,099\nGain on sale of loans - - - 581\nAdvisory income 4,120 3,709 8,058 7,160\nBrokerage income 2,128 1,889 3,910 3,779\nService fees and other income 2,563 2,172 5,513 5,389\nRental income 88 76 177 126\nTotal $ 10,742 $ 9,432 $ 21,240 $ 20,134\nTotal non-interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $1.3 million, or 13.9%, and $1.1 million, or 5.5%, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year. Material changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed below.\nTrust Income. Trust income is earned for trust services on the value of managed and non-managed assets held in custody. Volatility in the bond and\nequity markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related fees. Trust income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased\n$257,000, or 16.2% and $483,000, or 15.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in trust income between the periods\nis due to an increase in the value of trust assets over the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nVolatility related to overall economic expectations, impacts of geo-political instability related to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the potential for\ncontinued supply-chain disruptions, and regulatory action, including continued elevated market interest rates by the Federal Reserve aimed at tempering\nthe persistent inflationary pressures in the United States, all of which are likely to impact the bond and equity markets, or other factors, could result in\nfuture net decreases in the average values of our assets held in custody, and/or in a decrease in net flows to our assets held in custody, decreasing our\ntrust income.\nGain on sale of loans. The gain on sale of loans primarily reflects the gain from the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) and USDA loans\noriginated by the Bank’s SBA lending group. There were no loan sales, and therefore no gain on sale of loans, during the three months ended June 30,\n2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, gain on sale of loans decreased $581,000, or 100%, compared to the same period in the prior year, during\nwhich there was a gain on sale of loans resulting from the sale of $5.8 million of USDA loans.\n42\nTable of Contents\nAdvisory income. Advisory fees are typically based on a percentage of the underlying average asset values for a given period, where each\npercentage point represents 100 basis points. These revenues are of a recurring nature but are directly affected by increases and decreases in the values\nof the underlying assets. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, advisory income increased $411,000, or 11.1% and $898,000, or 12.5%,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in advisory income between the two periods is due to increases in advisory\nassets between the two periods from net inflows and market appreciation of our advisory assets. Similar to our trust income, changes in the value of our\nassets under management will result in comparable changes in our advisory income. In addition to volatility related to general economic expectations,\nregulatory action, including the effects of the persistent inflationary pressures in the United States and of elevated market interest rates by the Federal\nReserve aimed at tempering such inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions related to geo-political instability, including the ongoing wars\nin Ukraine and the Middle East, are likely to continue to put pressure on the financial markets and the value of and/or net inflows to our assets under\nmanagement, potentially decreasing our advisory income.\nBrokerage income. Brokerage revenues are generally based on a per share fee or commission to trade a share of a particular stock, bond or other\nsecurity. In addition, brokerage revenues, in this context, include private placements, participation in syndication of public offerings, and certain other\nrevenues, including interest earned on margin lending. Brokerage revenue is dependent on the volume of trading, and on private placement and\nsyndication activity during the period, and in the case of margin lending, on asset volumes and interest rates. Brokerage income for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, increased $239,000, or 12.7% and $131,000, or 3.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The majority\nof the increase was related primarily to an increase of $367,000 and $578,000 in over-the-counter commissions during the three and six months ended June\n30, 2024, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year, combined with an increase of $49,000 in syndicate income during each the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 over the same periods in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in income from margin\nparticipation interest of $185,000 and $459,000 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and a decrease in insurance\ncommissions of $16,000 and $58,000, respectively, and other immaterial increases of $25,000 and $21,000, respectively, during the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024. Expectations of economic disruption related to regulatory action with respect to interest rates and to geo-political factors, among\nother factors, could lead to continued stagnant offering activity given price uncertainty in the face of volatile markets and the potential for interest rates\nto remain elevated in the mid-term, which amount to additional risks for companies considering offering activity.\nThe table below reflects a rollforward of our client assets from December 31, 2022 through June 30, 2024, which includes both advisory and brokerage\nassets, and the inflows and outflows and net market appreciation from December 31, 2023 through June 30, 2024. Our brokerage and advisory assets\nexperienced an increase of approximately $872 million, or 13.6%, between June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, related to positive net flows and market\nappreciation.\n(In thousands) Client Assets\nAs of December 31, 2022 $ 5,199,471\nClient inflows 1,190,825\nClient outflows (764,419)\nNet flows 426,406\nMarket appreciation 769,386\nAs of June 30, 2023 $ 6,395,263\nClient inflows 1,224,522\nClient outflows (781,864)\nNet flows 442,658\nMarket appreciation 51,771\nAs of December 31, 2023 $ 6,889,692\nClient inflows 834,301\nClient outflows (976,377)\nNet flows (142,076)\nMarket appreciation 520,130\nAs of June 30, 2024 $ 7,267,746\n43\nTable of Contents\nService fees and other income. Service fees include fees for deposit-related services, loan servicing, third-party administration fees, and other\nincome. Service fees and other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $391,000, or 18.0%, and $124,000, or 2.3%, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily the result of increases in pension administration fees of $383,000 and\n$369,000, related to increases in the amount of work billed during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same\nperiods in the prior year. In addition, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, interest income on Sanders Morris Pershing accounts\nincreased $20,000 and $35,000, respectively. Offsetting these increases, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, consulting fees at Sanders\nMorris decreased $14,000 and $28,000, respectively, and service fees, including loan servicing fees, decreased $1,000 during the three months ended June\n30, 2024, and increased $19,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2024. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2023, other income decreased\nfrom the recovery of unclaimed funds at Sanders Morris of $264,000 during the first quarter of 2023. Other immaterial fluctuations netted to an increase of\n$3,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and a decrease of $7,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods in the prior year.\nRental income. The Company receives monthly rental income from tenants leasing space in the Bank building. Rental income for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 increased $12,000, or 15.8% and $51,000, or 40.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase\nwas related to concessions given to tenants during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe components of non-interest expense were as follows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 8,891 $ 7,641 $ 17,533 $ 15,503\nOccupancy and equipment 485 476 1,018 946\nTrust expenses 580 511 1,190 1,063\nBrokerage and advisory direct costs 517 472 1,037 943\nProfessional fees 468 539 902 1,062\nData processing 289 198 571 406\nOther 1,685 1,867 3,438 3,449\nTotal $ 12,915 $ 11,704 $ 25,689 $ 23,372\nTotal non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $1.2 million, or 10.3% and $2.3 million, or 9.9%, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year, due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, trust expense, brokerage expense,\nand data processing expense, which were partially offset by decreases professional fees expense and other expense. Material changes in the various\ncomponents of non-interest income are discussed below.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $1.3 million, or 16.4%, and\n$2.0 million, or 13.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily due to increases in salaries and related\npayroll expenses in our Banking segment of $794,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, due to increases in staff headcount and related signing bonuses,\nprimarily in the Bank’s SBA division, as well as cost of living and merit increases. The increase in salaries and employee benefits in the HoldCo segment\nof $485,000 and $968,000, respectively, was partially offset by the decrease in Tectonic Advisors, within the Other Financial Services segment, of $386,000\nand $813,000, respectively. Effective with the third quarter 2023, the technology and accounting teams were moved from Tectonic Advisors to HoldCo,\nwhich accounted for a portion of these variances. The balance of the increases in our HoldCo segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\napproximately $357,000 and $245,000, respectively, is due to an increase in headcount and merit increases, as well as increases in insurance benefit\npremiums.

The increase at Sanders Morris for the three months ended June 30, 2024 of $188,000 was due to an increase in\nbonuses earned on commissions, syndicate and private placement deals related to the increase in brokerage revenue between the two periods. The\ndecrease at Sanders Morris for the six months ended June 30, 2024 of $95,000 was due to a decrease in payroll taxes of $126,000 due to an over-accrual of\npayroll taxes at year end and a decrease in other employee benefits expense, including stock compensation recognized, of $81,000, offset by an increase in\ncommission and bonuses of $112,000, related to the increase in brokerage revenue over the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period\nin the prior year.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOccupancy and equipment expense. Occupancy and equipment expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $9,000, or 1.9%\nand $72,000, or 7.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were related to increases totaling $27,000 and $68,000,\nrespectively, at the HoldCo segment, primarily due to the technology team moving from the Other Financial Services segment to the HoldCo segment\neffective with the third quarter of 2023, which were partially offset by resulting decreases in the Other Financial Services segment of $19,000 and $7,000,\nrespectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The net increase for these two segments combined relates to the movement of our Plano\noffice to Frisco, Texas in March of 2023.

The decreases were the result of decreases of\n$58,000 and $87,000, respectively, in our HoldCo segment, decreases of $17,000 and $80,000, respectively, in our Banking segment, offset by increases of\n$4,000 and $8,000, respectively, in our Other Financial Services segment.

The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a $969,000 increase in the\nprovision for credit losses and a $909,000 increase in non-interest expense, partly offset by a $1.0 million increase net interest income and a $12,000\nincrease in non-interest income. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a $1.8 million increase in the provision for\ncredit losses, a $1.9 million increase in non-interest expense and a $509,000 decrease in non-interest income, partly offset by a $1.2 million increase net\ninterest income.\nNet interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $1.0 million, or 14.8%, and $1.2 million, or 8.1%, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increases in the average volume of and yield on loans and\nan increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). The impact\nof these items was partly offset by increases in the average interest volume of and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The average yield on interest earning\nassets was impacted by changes in market interest rates and changes in the mix of interest-earning assets. See “Net Interest Income,” above, for further\nanalysis of net interest income.\nThe provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $1.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively, compared $691,000\nand $770,000, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year.

Salaries and employee benefits increased $794,000 and $1.6 million for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year respectively, primarily due to increases in staff with the expansion of our SBA lending and\nIntegra factoring along with increases in annual merit and market increases. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $1,000 and $10,000 for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively, primarily due to increase in facilities repairs and\nmaintenance expense. Professional fees decreased $17,000 and $81,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in\nthe prior years, respectively, primarily due to higher legal fees expensed for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 related to loan collections and\nvarious other matters, along with lower audit fees recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. Data processing expense increased\n$78,000 and $144,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior years, respectively, as a result of a\nreduction of discounts provided by the Bank’s core system vendor related to the change in the core system during 2021, along with normal annual\nincrease in data processing costs. Other expenses increased $53,000 and $229,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiods in the prior years, respectively, which included increases of $59,000 $138,000 for advertising and marketing costs primarily in our Integra division,\n$102,000 and $131,000 for software development in our lending and Integra divisions, $8,000 and $26,000 for travel and meals, and decreases of $139,000\nand $138,000 in employee recruitment fees, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively,\namong other things.

The increases were due to increases in advisory income of $411,000 and $898,000, respectively, and\nincreases in trust income of $257,000 and $483,000, respectively, both of which were related to market increases in asset values and net asset inflows to\nour investment platform. Service fees and other income increased by $391,000 and $103,000, respectively, between the two periods, primarily related to\nincreases in third party pension administration fees from the Bank’s Nolan division of $383,000 and $369,000, respectively, which were partially offset for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024 by a decrease in miscellaneous income related to a recovery of unclaimed funds at Sanders Morris of $264,000 during\nthe first quarter 2023. In addition, brokerage income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $239,000 and $131,000, respectively,\nwith the majority of the increase relating primarily to increases of $367,000 and $578,000 in over-the-counter commissions during the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year, combined with a modest increase in syndicate income and other immaterial\nincreases. These increases were partially offset by decreases in income from margin participation interest of $185,000 and $459,000 during the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, respectively, related to the decreased appetite for margin lending given persistently high interest rates, and a modest\ndecrease in insurance commission.

These decreases were partially offset by increases for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024 in trust expense of $69,000 and $127,000, in brokerage and advisory direct costs of $45,000 and $94,000, respectively, as well as increases in\nprofessional fees of $4,000 and $8,000, respectively, and in data processing expense of $13,000 and $21,000, respectively. The decreases in salaries and\nemployee benefits expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was related to decreases of $386,000 and $813,000, respectively, at Tectonic\nAdvisors primarily from the transition of accounting and technology personnel to Tectonic Financial within the HoldCo segment, which were partially\noffset for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 by increases at the Bank’s Trust and Nolan divisions of $64,000 and $105,000, respectively, related\nto increases in salary expense from merit increases and in increased benefits expense, and for the three months ended June 30, 2024, by an increase at\nSanders Morris of $188,000 related to increases in commissions and bonuses related to syndicated offering activity and increases in general brokerage\nactivity, which increased commissions expense. Salary and benefits expense at Sanders Morris decreased by $95,000 for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 related to a decrease in payroll taxes of $126,000 due to an over-accrual of payroll taxes at year end 2023, offset by an increase in commission and\nbonuses of $112,000, related to the increase in brokerage revenue over the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe decreases in other operating costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were primarily related to decreases in marketing expense related\nto the change in our fee sharing agreement with Cain Watters, and to an increase in expense related to trading errors, particularly for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 related to a trading error during the first quarter 2024. The increases in trust expense related to increases in the value of trust assets at the\nBank, on which those fees are based, from market appreciation and positive net flows, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in\nbrokerage and advisory direct costs were primarily the result of increase in brokerage and offering activity at Sanders Morris, which increased clearing\nand service fees and execution charges, and increases in information services fees primarily related to an increase in headcount at Tectonic Advisors.\nThere were less material increases to data processing expense and professional fees. See “Non-Interest Expense,” above, for further analysis of non-\ninterest.\n48\nTable of Contents\nHoldCo\nThe loss before taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $486,000, or 47.2% and $1.1 million, or 56.5%, respectively, compared\nto the same periods in the prior year.

Non-interest expense increased $446,000 and $1.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $485,000 and $968,000, respectively, related to the\ntransition of accounting and technology personnel to Tectonic Financial, which is within the Company’s HoldCo segment, from Tectonic Advisors,\nwhose activity is within the Company’s Other Financial Services segment, to better reflect the function of those personnel given they serve departments\nacross the Company, as well as an increase in headcount. In addition, occupancy and equipment expense increased $27,000 and $68,000 related primarily\nto increases in rent, common area maintenance and parking totaling $24,000 and $52,000 from increases in headcount on our technology team, which\noffices in our Houston office, as well as the buildout of the technology team’s space in Houston, which increased depreciation expense and repairs and\nmaintenance expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. These increases were offset by a decrease in professional fees for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 of $58,000 and $87,000, respectively, driven by professional fees related to projects involving robotic process automation.\nOther operating expense decreased $8,000 and increased $52,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, related to increases in\nsoftware and software license expense and in postage expense related to marketing campaigns during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

In managing the portfolio, the Company seeks to attain the objectives of safety of\nprincipal, liquidity, diversification, and maximized return on investment.\nAs of June 30, 2024, securities available for sale consisted of U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Securities held to maturity consist of Property Assessed Clean Energy (“PACE”) and PID/TIRZ investments.\nThese investment contracts or bonds located in Texas, California and Florida, originate under a contractual obligation between the property owners, the\nlocal county or city administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. PACE assessments are created to fund the purchase and installation of\nenergy saving improvements to the property such as solar panels. PID/TIRZ assessments are used to pay for the development costs of a residential\nsubdivision. Generally, as a property assessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32 years by the then current property\nowner(s). Each installment is collected by the County or City Tax Collector where the property is located.

In making this assessment, the Company considers the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors for\neach security type in the portfolio. The issuers of these securities are U.S. government agencies and continue to make timely principal and interest\npayments under the contractual terms of the securities. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the\ntime the underlying securities were purchased. Due to the low risk in these U.S. government guaranteed securities, no allowance for credit losses for\navailable-for-sale securities was recognized as of June 30, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of securities available for sale and\nsecurities held to maturity as of June 30, 2024. Yields are calculated based on amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity\ncategories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or\nprepay obligations. Other securities classified as securities, restricted include stock in the FRB and the FHLB, which have no maturity date.

While we have instituted underwriting guidelines and policies and credit review procedures to protect us from avoidable credit\nlosses, some losses will inevitably occur.\nLoans are considered past due when principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments are contractually due.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan interest and generally when such loans\nare 90 days or more past due.\nForeclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less\nestimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses. On an\nongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations.

In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with\nASC 326, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When management deems\nall or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is charged-off against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the\nallowance. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326,\nreported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management’s best\nestimate of CECL on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to\ncredit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments\nto historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant\nfactors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a\nvariety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory\nauthorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 – Organization and Significant\nAccounting Policies and Note 3–- Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected\nin order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools. For dental and SBA 7(a) loans, the Company adjust\nthe pool life for expected prepayment speeds.\nFor all loan pools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate\nover two years on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver\nforecasts over the two year forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when\ndeveloping the forecast metrics.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.\nAdjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics. See the discussion of “Q-Factors,” below.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The allowance for\ncredit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the open pool method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an\nindividual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an\nallowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value\nof that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual\nterm excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt\nrestructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the\nreporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors (“Q-Factor”) that are not considered within our modeling processes but are\nnonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or\ndecrease management’s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks\nthat may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies,\nprocedures and strategies; (ii) staff experience; (iii) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (iv) concentration\nrisk; (v) trends in underlying collateral values; (vi) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; and (vii) economic conditions.\nUpon the adoption of ASC 326 effective on January 1, 2023, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated using the CECL\nmethodology increased $1.4 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated as of December 31, 2022 using the\nprior incurred loss model under GAAP.\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses as of the date indicated and the percentage of allocated possible loan\nlosses in each category to total gross loans as of the dates indicated:\n(In thousands, except percentages) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLoan Loan\nCategory to Category to\nAllocated: Amount Gross Loans Amount Gross Loans\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,434 13.8% $ 2,495 16.5%\nConsumer installment 14 0.1 18 0.2\nReal estate – residential 90 1.6 71 1.6\nReal estate – commercial 682 11.7 616 13.7\nReal estate – construction and land 188 6.5 143 8.9\nSBA 4,203 59.5 2,484 53.7\nUSDA 22 0.4 19 0.4\nFactored Receivables 643 6.4 462 5.0\nTotal allowance for credit losses $ 8,276 100.0% $ 6,308 100.0%\nThe table below presents a summary of the Company’s net loan loss experience and provisions to the allowance for credit losses for the periods\nindicated:\nAs of and for the Three Months As of and for the Six Months\nEnded Ended\nJune 30 June 30\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage loans outstanding $ 584,521 $ 478,586 $ 562,759 $ 479,040\nGross loans held for investment outstanding at end of period $ 575,643 $ 465,703 $ 575,643 $ 465,703\nAllowance for credit losses at beginning of period $ 6,730 $ 5,873 $ 6,308 $ 4,513\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 - - - 1,390\nProvision for credit losses 1,622 717 2,395 760\nCharge offs:\nCommercial and industrial - - - -\nSBA 7(a) - 328 56 328\nFactored Receivables 212 190 569 298\nTotal charge-offs 212 518 625 626\nRecoveries:\nSBA 7(a) 17 13 30 17\nFactored Receivables 119 53 168 84\nTotal recoveries 136 66 198 101\nNet charge-offs (76) (452) (427) (525)\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period $ 8,276 $ 6,138 $ 8,276 $ 6,138\nRatio of allowance for loans to end of period loans 1.44% 1.32% 1.44% 1.32%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans 0.01% 0.09% 0.08% 0.11%\nSources of Funds\nGeneral\nDeposits, loan and investment security repayments and prepayments, proceeds from the sale of securities, and cash flows generated from operations\nare the primary sources of our funds for lending, investing, and other general purposes.

The Company offers a broad selection of deposit products, including demand deposit accounts,\nNOW accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans (such as IRAs). Deposit\naccount terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the\nassociated interest rates. Management sets the deposit interest rates periodically based on a review of deposit flows and a survey of rates among\ncompetitors and other financial institutions. The Company relies on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain\ndeposits, and also on CD listing services. As of June 30, 2024, deposits include a $50.0 million brokered deposit through an Insured Cash Sweep One-\nWay Buy agreement.\nTotal deposits increased $92.2 million, or 17.5%, to $619.1 million as of June 30, 2024, as compared to $526.9 million as of December 31, 2023.

The increase\nincluded net income of $6.2 million, $42,000 related to stock compensation expenses and $4,000 net after-tax increase in accumulated other comprehensive\nloss. The increases were partly offset by the repurchase of common stock in the amount of $498,000 and dividends paid on the Series B preferred stock\nand paid on the common stock in the amounts of $776,000 and $1.4 million, respectively.\nTogether with the Bank, the Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could\nhave a direct material effect on the Bank’s and, accordingly, the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are\nalso subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of June 30, 2024, the Company and the\nBank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met the definition of\n“well-capitalized” under the applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the capital\nconservation buffer and the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions under the FDIC’s regulatory framework for prompt corrective action and\nthe Basel III capital guidelines.\nQuantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in\nthe table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), common equity Tier 1\ncapital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the\nregulations).\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios, as well as those of the Bank, as of the dates indicated:\n(In thousands, except percentages) June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTectonic Financial, Inc.\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 90,517 11.78% $ 86,847 13.97%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk Weighted Assets) 73,267 14.43 69,597 15.74\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 90,517 17.83 86,847 19.65\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 96,891 19.09 92,385 20.90\nT Bank, N.A.\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 91,308 12.01% $ 87,488 14.26%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk Weighted Assets) 91,308 18.17 87,488 20.04\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 91,308 18.17 87,488 20.04\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 97,617 19.43 92,957 21.29\n55\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the regulatory\nframework applicable to registered investment advisors under the SEC’s Division of Investment Management.\nSanders Morris is regulated by FINRA, which, among other requirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital. As of June 30, 2024,\nSanders Morris is in compliance with its net regulatory capital requirement.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity relates to our ability to maintain a steady flow of funds to support our ongoing operating, investing and financing activities. Our board\nof directors establishes policies and analyzes and manages liquidity to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet normal operating requirements in\naddition to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable\nsupply of core deposits and funds. Ultimately, public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital\nposition. Liquidity management is viewed from a long-term and a short-term perspective as well as from an asset and liability perspective. We monitor\nliquidity through a regular review of loan and deposit maturities and forecasts, incorporating this information into a detailed projected cash flow model.\nThe Bank’s liquidity is monitored by its management, the Asset-Liability Committee and its board of directors who review historical funding\nrequirements, current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated\nfuture funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments.\nThe Company’s primary sources of funds are retail, small business, custodial, wholesale commercial deposits, loan repayments, maturity of\ninvestment securities, other short-term borrowings, and other funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments\nare relatively predictable, deposit flows and loan prepayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions, and competition. The\nCompany will maintain investments in liquid assets based upon management’s assessment of (1) the need for funds, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields\navailable on short-term liquid assets, and (4) objectives of the asset/liability management program.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $61.5 million held in an interest-bearing account at the FRB. The Company has the ability to\nborrow funds as members of the FHLB and the FRB. As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $54.5 million based upon\nloan collateral pledged to the FHLB, of which none was utilized as of June 30, 2024.\nThe borrowing capacity on the discount line of credit with the FRB was $38.8 million, of which none was utilized as of June 30, 2024. During March\n2023, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP, which was made available to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system.\nThe BTFP allows the whole par value of available for sale securities to be included as the collateral value. As of June 30, 2024, securities with a par value\nof $20.1 million were pledged to the Federal Reserve under this program, of which $20.0 million was borrowed against. In addition, the Company has\napproximately $183.4 million of SBA guaranteed loans held for investment that could be sold to investors.\nManagement believes that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations. However, if general economic conditions, potential recession\nin the United States and our market areas, the impacts related to or resulting from recent bank failures and any continuation of the recent uncertainty in\nthe banking industry, including the associated impact to the Company and other financial institutions of any regulatory changes or other mitigation\nefforts taken by government agencies in response thereto, increased competition for deposits and related changes in deposit customer behavior, changes\nin market interest rates, the persistence of the current inflationary environment in the United States and our market areas, or other events, cause these\nsources of external funding to become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher\nfunding costs or operating restrictions in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company’s operations and growth.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers.\nThese financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements\nof credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the\nother party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those\ninstruments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of credit extended is\nbased on management’s credit evaluation of the customer and, if deemed necessary, may require collateral.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit of approximately $66.8 million and $162,000, respectively.\nAllowance For Credit Losses–- Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is\ncalculated under the CECL model, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk\nresulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit detailed above. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by\nloan segment at each balance sheet date using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur\nbased on historical utilization rates. Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the impact of adoption was $238,000 to the allowance for credit losses\nfor off-balance-sheet credit exposure. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled $374,000 and $192,000 at June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a credit loss expense related to off-balance-\nsheet credit exposures totaling $38,000 and $182,000, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we reversed $25,000 credit loss expense,\nand during the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized a credit loss expense totaling $10,000. Further information regarding our policies and\nmethodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 11 – Commitments and\nContingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nAs a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability management policy provides management\nwith guidelines for effective funds management and we have established a measurement system for monitoring the net interest rate sensitivity position.\nFluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market\nvalue of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of\neconomic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of\ncurrent fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while\nat the same time maximizing income.\nWe manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We use no off-balance-sheet financial\ninstruments to manage interest rate risk.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank’s Asset Liability Committee in accordance with policies approved by the Bank’s board of\ndirectors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the\ncommittee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, liquidity, business\nstrategies and other factors.\nThe committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market\nvalues of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments\nand borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity.\nWe employ methodologies to manage interest rate risk which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model.\n57\nTable of Contents\nWe use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and\nthe impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot\nprecisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results\nwill differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and\nthe application and timing of various management strategies.\nOn at least an annual basis, we run various stress tests to measure the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market\ninterest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously, and ramped rates change over a twelve-month and\ntwenty-four month horizon based upon parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve\ncompared to a flat yield curve scenario. Additionally, we run non-parallel simulation involving analysis of interest income and expense under various\nchanges in the shape of the yield curve.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of an instantaneous, sustained simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of\nJune 30, 2024:\nChange in Interest Rates (basis\npoints) % Change in Net Interest Income\n+200 6.84\n+100 3.40\n-100 (4.06)\n-200 (7.08)\nWe have found that, historically, interest rates on deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This\nassumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis, meaning that process by which we measure the\ngap between interest rate sensitive assets verses interest rate sensitive liabilities. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain\nand, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on\nnet interest income. Actual results will differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as\nchanges in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These\nrequire the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of\nmoney over time due to inflation or recession. Inflation generally increases the costs of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other\nassets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are\nmonetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of\ngeneral levels of inflation. In addition, inflation affects a financial institution’s cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits,\noccupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases in market interest rates by the Federal Reserve generally decrease the market value of\ninvestments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings and shareholders’ equity.\n58\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, an evaluation was performed by the Company, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its\ndisclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and\nmanagement was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act) were effective at the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n59\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\nTectonic Financial, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Texas corporation and registered financial holding company that offers, through\nits subsidiaries, banking and other financial services including trust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, factoring, third-party administration,\nrecordkeeping and insurance services to individuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States.\nWe operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. (“TBI”), which was incorporated under the laws of the State of\nTexas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the registered bank holding company for T Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the “Bank”), (ii) Sanders\nMorris LLC (“Sanders Morris”), a registered broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and registered investment advisor\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), (iii) Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic Advisors”), a registered investment advisor\nregistered with the SEC focused generally on managing money for relatively large, affiliated institutions, and (iv) HWG Insurance Agency LLC (“HWG”),\nan insurance agency registered with the Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”).\nWe are headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Bank operates through its main office located at 16200 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas. Our other\nsubsidiaries operate from offices in Houston, Dallas and Frisco, Texas. Our Houston, Texas office is located at 600 Travis Street, 59th Floor, Houston,\nTexas, and includes the home offices of Sanders Morris and HWG, as well as Tectonic Advisors’ family office services team. Our other Dallas office,\nwhich is a branch office of Sanders Morris, is located at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 470, Dallas, Texas. The main office for Tectonic Advisors is in Frisco,\nTexas, and is located at 17 Cowboys Way, Suite 250, Frisco, Texas, and also includes a branch office of HWG.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services primarily to small- to medium-sized businesses and their\nemployees, and other institutions. The Nolan Company (“Nolan”), operating as a division within the Bank from Nolan’s office in Overland Park, Kansas,\noffers third party administration (“TPA”) services, and Integra Funding Solutions, LLC (“Integra”), also operating as a division within the Bank from\nIntegra’s office in Fort Worth, Texas, offers factoring services. The Bank’s technological capabilities, including worldwide free ATM withdrawals,\nsophisticated on-line banking capabilities, electronic funds transfer capabilities, and economical remote deposit solutions, allow most customers to be\nserved regardless of their geographic location. The Bank serves its local geographic market which includes Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, Collin and Rockwall\ncounties in Texas which encompass an area commonly referred to as the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The Bank also serves the dental and other health\nprofessional industries through a centralized loan and deposit platform that operates out of its main office in Dallas, Texas. In addition, the Bank serves\nthe small business community by offering loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(“USDA”).\nThe Bank offers a wide range of deposit services including demand deposits, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, individual retirement\naccounts, and certificates of deposit with fixed rates and a range of maturity options. Lending services include commercial loans to small- to medium-sized\nbusinesses and professional concerns as well as consumers. The Bank also offers trust services. The Bank’s traditional fiduciary services clients primarily\nconsist of clients of Cain, Watters & Associates, LLC (“Cain Watters”). The Bank, Cain Watters and Tectonic Advisors entered into an advisory services\nagreement related to the Bank’s trust operations in April 2006, which has been amended from time to time, most recently in January 2023. See Note 12 –\nRelated Parties, to these consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, the Nolan division of the Bank offers TPA services and\nprovides clients with retirement plan design and administrative services, specializing in ministerial recordkeeping, administration, actuarial and design\nservices for retirement plans of small businesses and professional practices. We believe offering TPA services allows us to serve our clients more fully\nand to attract new clients to our trust platform.\nBasis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (this\n“Form 10-Q”) include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in\nconsolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q adopted by the SEC. Accordingly, the consolidated financial\nstatements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction\nwith our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the audited financial statements included within\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments that were normal and recurring in nature, and considered necessary, have been included for the fair\npresentation of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are\nnot necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amount of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could be significantly different from\nthose estimates. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates. The determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses, the fair value of stock options, the fair values of financial instruments and other real estate owned, and the status of contingencies are particularly\nsusceptible to significant change in recorded amounts.\nAccounting Changes, Reclassifications and Restatements. Certain items in prior financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”), effective on January 1, 2023. The guidance replaces the incurred loss\nmethodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. The CECL model requires\nthe measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures based on\nhistorical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant\nestimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13\npermits the use of estimation techniques that are practical and relevant to the Company’s circumstances, as long as they are applied consistently over\ntime and faithfully estimate expected credit losses in accordance with the standard. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available for\nsale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt\nsecurities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required to sell. Management has made a policy\nelection to exclude accrued interest receivable on available for sale securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately in\nother assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet (“OBS”) credit exposures. Results for\nreporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with\npreviously applicable incurred loss model under GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses\nof $1.4 million which was recognized through a $1.1 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of\nthe allowance for credit losses to $5.9 million as of January 1, 2023. In addition, the Company recorded a $237,505 reserve on unfunded commitments\nwhich is recorded in other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and was recognized through a $188,000 adjustment to retained\nearnings, net of tax.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been\nrecognized prior to January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities.\nTherefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses for debt securities was not required.\nASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), eliminates\nthe accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings in ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables -Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while\nenhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nAdditionally, ASU 2022-02 requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net\ninvestments in leases within the scope of ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost. The Company\nadopted ASU 2022-02 on a modified retrospective basis effective on January 1, 2023. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\n9\nTable of Contents\nEarnings per Share. Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted EPS is computed using the weighted-average shares and all potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth\nthe computation of basic and diluted EPS for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 2,673 $ 4,326\nAverage shares outstanding 7,102 7,069\nEffect of dilutive securities 159 226\nAverage diluted shares outstanding 7,261 7,295\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.38 $ 0.61\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.37 $ 0.59\nAs of March 31, 2024, options to purchase 167,500 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $5.51, were included in the\ncomputation of diluted net earnings per share. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, 78,000 shares of restricted stock grants with a grant date fair value of\n$4.81 per share which vest from 2024 through 2025 were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.\nNote 2.

These investment contracts or bonds are located in Texas, California and Florida, and originate under a contractual obligation\nbetween the property owners, the local county or city administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. PACE assessments are created to fund\nthe purchase and installation of energy saving improvements to the property such as solar panels. PID/TIRZ assessments are used to pay for the\ndevelopment costs of a residential subdivision. Generally, as a property assessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32\nyears by the then current property owner(s). Each installment is collected by the County or City Tax Collector where the property is located. The\nassessments are an obligation of the property. Securities, restricted consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (“FRB”) and Federal Home Loan Bank of\nDallas (“FHLB”) stock, which are carried at cost.\nDuring each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, no securities available for sale were sold, and there were no realized gains or losses\nrecorded on sales for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, securities available for sale with a fair value of $967,000 and $988,000, respectively, were pledged\nagainst trust deposit balances held at the Bank. In March 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) created the\nBank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”), which was made available to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system. The\nBTFP allows the par value of available for sale securities to be included as the collateral value. As of March 31, 2024, securities with a par value of $21.2\nmillion were pledged to the Federal Reserve under the BTFP, of which $21.0 million was borrowed against. As of March 31, 2024, there were no securities\npledged to secure borrowings at the FHLB.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank held FRB stock in the amount of $2.2 million. The Bank held FHLB stock in the amount of $2.0\nmillion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of which were classified as securities, restricted.\nThe table below indicates the length of time individual investment securities have been in a continuous loss position as of March 31, 2024:\nMarch 31, 2024\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(In thousands) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ 2,921 $ 7 $ 997 $ 3 $ 3,918 $ 10\nU.S. government agencies - - 13,529 2,101 13,529 2,101\nMortgage-backed securities 2,599 46 4,303 324 6,902 370\nTotal $ 5,520 $ 53 $ 18,829 $ 2,428 $ 24,349 $ 2,481\nBeginning January 1, 2023, the Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any debt securities in a loss position require an allowance\nfor credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company had a total of twenty-five (25) investment positions in the unrealized loss position as of\nMarch 31, 2024. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors based upon our analysis of the\nunderlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, such as bond ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and\nin consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of\ncash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the\namount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense.\nLosses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAs of March 31, 2024, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available for sale and held to maturity securities in an unrealized loss\nposition as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the\nunderlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our securities and in consideration of our historical credit\nloss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities are U.S. government agencies who continue to make timely principal and interest\npayments under the contractual terms of the securities. Furthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as\navailable for sale in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost.\nThe unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair\nvalue is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available for sale as of March 31, 2024 are presented in the table below by contractual\nmaturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.

The Bank believes that these loans are to credit worthy\nborrowers and are diversified geographically.\nAccrued interest receivable on loans totaled $3.3 million and $3.1 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in\naccrued interest receivable and other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Company serves the small business community by offering loans promulgated under the SBA’s 7(a) and 504 loan programs, and loans\nguaranteed by the USDA. SBA 7(a) and USDA loans are typically guaranteed by each agency in amounts ranging from 75% to 80% of the principal\nbalance. For SBA construction loans, the Company records the guaranteed funded portion of the loans as held for sale. When the SBA loans are fully\nfunded, the Company may sell the guaranteed portion into the secondary market, on a servicing-retained basis, or reclassify from loans held for sale to\nloans held for investment if the Company determines that holding these loans provide better long-term risk adjusted returns than selling the loans. In\ncalculating gain on the sale of loans, the Company performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portion of the\nloan. The Company’s assumptions are validated by reference to external market information.\nThe Company had $22.8 million and $26.6 million of SBA/USDA loans held for sale as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no sales of loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company sold the guaranteed\nportion of one USDA loan totaling $5.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of loans of $581,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company\nelected to reclassify $17.7 million of the SBA 7(a) loans held for sale to loans held for investment.\nLoan Origination/Risk Management.\nThe Company maintains written loan origination policies, procedures, and processes which address credit quality within an acceptable level of risk at\nseveral levels including individual loan level, loan type, and loan portfolio levels.\nCommercial and industrial loans, which are predominantly loans to dentists, are underwritten based on historical and projected income of the\nbusiness and individual borrowers and guarantors. The Company utilizes a comprehensive global debt service coverage analysis to determine debt\nservice coverage ratios. This analysis compares global cash flow of the borrowers and guarantors on an individual credit to existing and proposed debt\nafter consideration of personal and business-related other expenses. Collateral is generally a lien on all available assets of the business borrower\nincluding intangible assets. Credit worthiness of individual borrowers and guarantors is established through the use of credit reports and credit scores.\nConsumer loans are evaluated on the basis of credit worthiness as established through the use of credit reports and credit scores. Additional credit\nquality indicators include borrower debt to income ratios based on verifiable income sources.\nReal estate mortgage loans are evaluated based on collateral value as well as global debt service coverage ratios based on historical and projected\nincome from all related sources including the collateral property, the borrower, and all guarantors where applicable.\nThe Company originates SBA loans which are sometimes sold into the secondary market. The Company continues to service these loans after sale\nand is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts. The two primary SBA loan programs that the Company offers are the basic SBA 7(a)\nloan guaranty program and the SBA 504 loan program in conjunction with junior lien financing from a Certified Development Company (“CDC”). The SBA\nhas designated the Bank as a “Preferred Lender.” As an SBA Preferred Lender, the Bank has been delegated loan approval, closing and most servicing\nand liquidation authority from the SBA.\nThe SBA 7(a) program serves as the SBA’s primary business loan program to help qualified small businesses obtain financing when they might not\nbe eligible for business loans through normal lending channels. Loan proceeds under this program can be used for most business purposes including\nworking capital, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, land and building (including purchase, renovation and new construction), leasehold\nimprovements and debt refinancing. Loan maturity is generally up to 10 years for non-real estate collateral and up to 25 years for real estate collateral. The\nSBA 7(a) loan is approved and funded by a qualified lender, partially guaranteed by the SBA and subject to applicable regulations. In general, the SBA\nguarantees up to 75% of the loan amount depending on loan size. The Company is required by the SBA to service the loan and retain a contractual\nminimum of 5% on all SBA 7(a) loans, but generally retains 25% (the unguaranteed portion). The servicing spread is 1% of the guaranteed portion of the\nloan that is sold in the secondary market. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total of loans that we sold and service was $34.7 million and\n$37.9 million, respectively.\nThe SBA 504 program is an economic development-financing program providing long-term, low down payment loans to businesses. Typically, a 504\nproject includes a loan secured from a private-sector lender with a senior lien, a loan secured from a CDC (funded by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture)\nwith a junior lien covering up to 40% of the total cost, and a contribution of at least 10% equity from the borrower. Debenture limits are $5.0 million for\nregular 504 loans and $5.5 million for those 504 loans that meet a public policy goal.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also offers Business & Industry (“B&I”) program loans through the USDA. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they\nare guaranteed by the USDA. The guaranteed amount is generally 80%. B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally\nlarger loans to larger businesses than the SBA 7(a) loans. Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market. These loans can be\nutilized for rural commercial real estate and equipment. The loans can have maturities up to 30 years and the rates can be fixed or variable.\nConstruction and land development loans are evaluated based on the borrower’s and guarantor’s credit worthiness, past experience in the industry,\ntrack record and experience with the type of project being considered, and other factors. Collateral value is determined generally by independent appraisal\nutilizing multiple approaches to determine value based on property type.\nThe Bank engages in third-party factoring of certain business’s accounts receivable invoices. The Bank’s factoring clients are primarily in the\ntransportation industry. Each account debtor is credit qualified, confirming credit worthiness and stability, because the underlying debtor represents the\nsubstantive underlying credit risk. Some factored receivables are full recourse to and personally guaranteed by the factoring client. In such cases, the\nclient is credit qualified under specific policy guidelines. Concentration limits are set and monitored for aggregate factored receivables, account debtors,\nand individual factoring clients. In addition, we consider the overall state of each specific industry, currently over-the-road trucking, in our evaluation of\nthe credit worthiness of the factoring client and the underlying debtor.\nFor all loan types, the Company establishes guidelines for its underwriting criteria including collateral coverage ratios, global debt service coverage\nratios, and maximum amortization or loan maturity terms.\nAt the portfolio level, the Company monitors concentrations of loans based on several criteria including loan type, collateral type, industry,\ngeography, and other factors. The Company also performs periodic market research and economic analysis at a local geographic and national level. Based\non this research, the Company may from time to time change the minimum or benchmark underwriting criteria applied to the above loan types.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of the Company’s management, the borrower may be unable to meet payment\nobligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or\nnot such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. A loan may be returned to accrual\nstatus when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are\nreasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower.\nNon-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, were as follows as of the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNon-Accrual with Non-Accrual with\nTotal No Credit Loss Total No Credit Loss\n(In thousands) Non-Accrual Allowance Non-Accrual Allowance\nCommercial and industrial $ 691 $ - $ - $ -\nReal estate - residential 125 125 221 221\nSBA guaranteed 3,238 3,238 1,951 1,951\nSBA unguaranteed 910 910 251 251\nTotal $ 4,964 $ 4,360 $ 2,423 $ 2,423\nThe Company did not recognize any interest income on non-accrual loans during the three ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFrom time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result\nin new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of a principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a combination thereof, among other things. During the three months ended March 31, 2024,\nthere were no loan modifications of significance. There were no loans that were modified due to the borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the\npreceding twelve months that were past due for the three months ended March 31, 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company\nprovided one modification to extend the maturity date of a SBA loan with an outstanding balance of $357,000.\n14\nTable of Contents\nUnder ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net\namount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. The\nCompany’s allowance for credit losses for loans consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically\nidentified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical credit loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk\nfactors both internal and external to the Company.\nThe Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected\nin order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. In setting the\nspecific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to\neach loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans, which along with the delinquency list of loans,\nhelps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified\nas impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company\nallocates a specific reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the loan or when the discounted cash flows for the loan is lower than\nthe carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit\nlosses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the\nsale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis.\nIn determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical lifetime credit loss experience,\nconcentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company’s loan portfolio, current economic conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower’s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the\nCompany’s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and\nexternal to the Company and other relevant factors in accordance with ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.” Historical lifetime credit\nloss experience is determined by utilizing an open-pool (“cumulative loss rate”) methodology. Adjustments to the historical lifetime credit loss experience\nare made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations, delinquency, non-accrual, and watch list levels, as well\nas changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates, property and collateral values, and other indices relating to\neconomic activity. The utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates. For all loan\npools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over two years\non a straight-line basis. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance\nof each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not\npreclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit\nlosses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics.\nThe Bank had no collateral-dependent loans individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses as of March 31, 2024.

Loans are graded in one of six categories: (i) pass, (ii)\npass-watch, (iii) special mention, (iv) substandard, (v) doubtful, or (vi) loss. Loans graded as loss are charged-off.\nThe classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. The Company reviews the ratings on\ncredits quarterly. No significant changes were made to the loan risk grading system definitions and allowance for credit loss methodology during the past\nyear. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be inherent in each credit. The guaranteed portion of SBA loans that are\nclassified are included in the pass category. The Company’s methodology is structured so that specific allocations are increased in accordance with\ndeterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a\ncorresponding decrease in risk and loss).\nCredits rated pass are acceptable loans, appropriately underwritten, bearing an ordinary risk of loss to the Company. Loans in this category are loans\nto highly credit worthy borrowers with financial statements presenting a good primary source as well as an adequate secondary source of repayment.\n16\nTable of Contents\nCredits rated pass-watch loans have been determined to require enhanced monitoring for potential weaknesses which require further investigation.\nThey have no significant delinquency in the past twelve months. This rating causes the loan to be actively monitored with greater frequency than pass\nloans and allows appropriate downgrade transition if verifiable adverse events are confirmed. This category may also include loans that have improved in\ncredit quality from special mention but are not yet considered pass loans.\nCredits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness; however, such concerns are not so\npronounced that the Company generally expects to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform\nwithin standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits rated more harshly.\nCredits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse\ntrends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these\ncredits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to strengthen the Company’s position, and/or to reduce exposure and to\nassure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the\nsecondary support to the credit is performed. Guaranteed portions of SBA loans graded substandard are generally on non-accrual due to the limited\namount of interest covered by the guarantee, usually 60 days maximum. However, there typically will be no exposure to loss on the principal amount of\nthese guaranteed portions of the loan.\nCredits rated doubtful are those in which full collection of principal appears highly questionable, and which some degree of loss is anticipated, even\nthough the ultimate amount of loss may not yet be certain and/or other factors exist which could affect collection of debt. Based upon available\ninformation, positive action by the Company is required to avert or minimize loss.\nLoans classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This\nclassification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off\nthis asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of loans by year of origination and internal ratings as of March 31, 2024:\nTerm Loans by Origination Year Revolving\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Loans Total\nCommercial and industrial\nPass $ 1,886 $ 14,966 $ 23,312 $ 16,049 $ 7,506 $ 13,722 $ 1,914 $ 79,355\nPass-watch -

The Plan was amended and restated by the Company’s board of directors and common\nstock shareholders effective March 27, 2019 in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. The Plan is administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Company’s board of directors and authorizes the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted\nstock units to employees, directors and consultants in order to promote the success of the Company’s business. Incentive stock options may be granted\nonly to employees of the Company, or a parent or subsidiary of the Company. The Company reserved 750,000 authorized shares of common stock for the\nPlan. The term of each stock option is no longer than 10 years from the date of the grant.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation plans using the fair value-based method of accounting.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit\nloss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is\nrepresented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional\nobligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes loan commitments as of the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nUndisbursed loan commitments $ 59,320 $ 45,743\nStandby letters of credit 162 162\nTotal $ 59,482 $ 45,905\nAllowance For Credit Losses – Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a\nliability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to\ncredit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation.\nOff-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in the table\nabove. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur, and the amount expected to\nbe funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are\nbased on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments\nexpected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same\nmethodology as described for loans in Note 4 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded.\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet commitments for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Three Months\nEnded Ended\n(In thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 192 $ -\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 - 238\nProvision for off-balance sheet credit exposure 144 35\nEnding balance $ 336 $ 273\nThe Company is involved in various regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to\ntime in the ordinary course of business. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that\nan unfavorable resolution of these matters, will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The\nCompany’s regular practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal matters, and to accrue for liabilities when payment is\nprobable.\nThe Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sanders Morris, has uncommitted financing arrangements with clearing brokers that finance its\ncustomer accounts, certain broker-dealer balances, and firm trading positions. Although these customer accounts and broker-dealer balances are not\nreflected on the consolidated balance sheets for financial reporting purposes, Sanders Morris has generally agreed to indemnify these clearing brokers for\nlosses they may sustain in connection with the accounts, and therefore, retains risk on these accounts. Sanders Morris is required to maintain certain\ncash or securities on deposit with its clearing brokers. Deposits with clearing organizations were $250,000 at each of March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company is party to amended and restated employment agreements with Patrick Howard, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company,\nand Ken Bramlage, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In addition, the Company entered into an employment agreement\nwith A. Haag Sherman, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, in connection with the Company’s merger with Tectonic Holdings and its initial public\noffering. Messrs. Sherman and Howard’s employment agreements have a four year term and Mr. Bramlage’s employment agreement has a three year term.\nEach employment agreement is automatically renewable for an additional one-year term unless either party elects not to renew.\n25\nTable of Contents\nNote 12. Related Parties\nAdvisors’ service agreements: In January 2006, the Company entered into a services agreement (the “Tectonic Advisors-CWA Services Agreement”)\nwith Cain Watters. The owners of Cain Watters together hold approximately 30% of the voting ownership in the Company. Under the Tectonic Advisors-\nCWA Services Agreement, Cain Watters pays the Company for due diligence and research services on investment alternatives available to Cain Watters’\nclients. The Company earned $46,000 and $25,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under the Tectonic Advisors-\nCWA Services Agreement. These fees are included in investment advisory and other related services in the accompanying consolidated statements of\nincome. The Company had $498,000 and $95,000 in fees payable related to these services at each of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which is\nincluded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCWA Fee Allocation Agreement: In January 2006, Tectonic Advisors entered into an agreement (the “Fee Allocation Agreement”) with Cain Watters\nwith reference to its advisory agreement with the Bank. Tectonic Advisors had $217,000 and $215,000 payable to Cain Watters related to this agreement at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 certain officers, directors and their affiliated companies had depository accounts with the Bank totaling\napproximately $7.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively. None of those deposit accounts have terms more favorable than those available to any other\ndepositor. There were no loans outstanding to directors of the Bank or their affiliated companies as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 13. Regulatory Matters\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material effect on the Bank’s and, accordingly, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of\nthe Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under GAAP, regulatory reporting requirements, and regulatory capital\nstandards. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings\nand other factors. Furthermore, the Bank’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in these financial statements.\nQuantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain\nminimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital to total\nrisk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets. To be categorized as “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework, the\nBank must maintain (i) a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%; and (iv) a CET1\nrisk-based capital ratio of 6.5%.\nThe Basel III minimum capital ratio requirements and additional capital conservation buffers as applicable to the Company and the Bank as of March\n31, 2024 are summarized in the table below.\nBASEL III BASEL III BASEL III\nMinimum for Additional Ratio with\nCapital Capital Capital\nAdequacy Conservation Conservation\nRequirements Buffer Buffer\nTotal Risk Based Capital (total capital to risk weighted assets) 8.0% 2.5% 10.5%\nTier 1 Risk Based Capital (tier 1 to risk weighted assets) 6.0% 2.5% 8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk Based ( CET1 to risk weighted assets) 4.5% 2.5% 7.0%\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio (tier 1 to average assets) 4.0% -% 4.0%\nAccordingly, a financial institution may be considered “well-capitalized” under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework, but not satisfy the\nbuffered Basel III capital ratios. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met the definition of “well-capitalized” under the applicable\nregulations of the Federal Reserve and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the capital conservation buffer and the levels established for\n“well-capitalized” institutions under the FDIC’s regulatory framework for prompt corrective action and the Basel III capital guidelines.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank are as follows as of the dates indicated:\nMinimum Capital Required to be Considered\nActual Required–- Basel III Well Capitalized\n(In thousands, except percentages) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of March 31, 2024\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets)\nTectonic Financial, Inc.

Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the\neffect of dividends declared (including those on the Series A preferred stock) would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank and/or the Company to fall\nbelow specified minimum levels. Approval is also required if dividends declared exceed the net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits\nfor the preceding two years. As of March 31, 2024, approximately $27.2 million was available for the declaration of dividends by the Bank to the Company\nwithout prior approval of regulatory agencies and still maintain its “well-capitalized” status. In addition, as a Texas corporation, we are restricted under\nthe Texas Business Organizations Code from paying dividends under certain conditions. Under Texas law, we cannot pay dividends to shareholders if the\ndividends exceed our surplus or if after giving effect to the dividends, we would be insolvent.\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the regulatory\nframework applicable to registered investment advisors under the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, and additionally, Sanders Morris is\nregulated by FINRA, which, among other requirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital.\nNote 14. Operating Segments\nThe Company’s reportable segments consist of “Banking,” “Other Financial Services,” and “HoldCo” operations.\nThe “Banking” segment consists of operations relative to the Company’s full service banking operations, including providing depository and\nlending services to individual and business customers, and other related banking services, along with services provided through the factoring operations\nof the Bank’s Integra division.\nThe “Other Financial Services” segment includes managed and directed brokerage, investment advisory services, including related trust company\noperations, third party administration, and life and disability insurance brokerage services to both individuals and businesses.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe “HoldCo” operations include the operations and subordinated debt held at the Bank’s immediate parent, as well as the activities of the financial\nholding company which serves as TBI’s parent.\nThe tables below present the financial information for each segment that is specifically identifiable, or based on allocations using internal methods,\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 14,298 $ - $ - $ 14,298\nTotal interest expense 6,873 - 323 7,196\nProvision for credit losses 917 - - 917\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 6,508 - (323) 6,185\nNon-interest income 364 10,134 - 10,498\nDepreciation and amortization expense 102 9 2 113\nAll other non-interest expense 4,966 6,494 1,201 12,661\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 1,804 $ 3,631 $ (1,526) $ 3,909\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,396 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,746\nTotal assets $ 763,933 $ 13,001 $ 663 $ 777,597\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 10,913 $ - $ - $ 10,913\nTotal interest expense 3,605 - 265 3,870\nProvision for credit losses 78 - - 78\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 7,230 - (265) 6,965\nNon-interest income 884 9,817 - 10,701\nDepreciation and amortization expense 96 16 - 112\nAll other non-interest expense 4,002 6,906 648 11,556\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 4,016 $ 2,895 $ (913) $ 5,998\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,607 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,957\nTotal assets $ 617,228 $ 13,416 $ 851 $ 631,495\nNote 15. Fair Value of Financials Instruments\nThe fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction\noccurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. In estimating fair value, the\nCompany utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. Such valuation\ntechniques are consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n● Level 1 Inputs–- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability\nto access at the measurement date.\n● Level 2 Inputs–- Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as\ninterest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market\ndata by correlation or other means.\n● Level 3 Inputs–- Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions\nabout the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWhere quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market\nprices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing\nservices and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves,\ninterest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation\nhierarchy. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company has no\nsecurities in the Level 1 or Level 3 inputs.\nThe following table summarizes securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated by the level of the valuation\ninputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value, as of the dates indicated:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In thousands) Inputs Inputs Inputs Fair Value\nAs of March 31, 2024\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ - $ 3,918 $ - $ 3,918\nU.S. government agencies - 13,529 - 13,529\nMortgage-backed securities - 6,902 - 6,902\nAs of December 31, 2023\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ - $ 3,894 $ - $ 3,894\nU.S. government agencies - 13,627 - 13,627\nMortgage-backed securities - 5,456 - 5,456\nMarket valuations of our investment securities which are classified as level 2 are provided by an independent third party. The fair values are\ndetermined by using several sources for valuing fixed income securities. Their techniques include pricing models that vary based on the type of asset\nbeing valued and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, the market valuation sources\ninclude observable market inputs and are therefore considered Level 2 inputs for purposes of determining the fair values.\nThe Company considers transfers between the levels of the hierarchy to be recognized at the end of related reporting periods. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, no assets for which fair value is measured on a recurring basis transferred between any levels of the hierarchy.\nCertain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair\nvalue on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\nFinancial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the reported periods include impaired loans and loans held for sale.\nCollateral dependent loan. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent\nloans primarily relate to the specialized discounting criteria applied to the borrower’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount\ndepends upon the condition and marketability of the collateral, as well as other factors which may affect the collectability of the loan. As the Company’s\nprimary objective in the event of default would be to liquidate the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, collateral that is less marketable\nwould receive a larger discount. During the reported periods, there was no allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans.\nThe valuation of our not readily marketable investment securities which are classified as Level 3 are based on the Company’s own assumptions and\ninputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement, and are unobservable.\nOur assessment of the significance of a particular input to the Level 3 fair value measurements in their entirety requires judgment and considers\nfactors specific to the assets. It is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated fair value for instruments measured using Level 3 inputs could occur\nin the future.\nLoans held for sale. Loans held for sale include the guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans and are reported at the lower of cost or estimated fair\nvalue. Fair value for SBA and USDA loans is based on market indications available in the market. There were no impairments reported for the periods\npresented.\n29\nTable of Contents\nNon-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the reported periods include other real estate owned which, upon initial\nrecognition, was re-measured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, foreclosed assets which,\nsubsequent to their initial recognition, are re-measured at fair value through a write-down included in other non-interest expense. Regulatory guidelines\nrequire the Company to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. The fair value of foreclosed assets, upon initial\nrecognition and impairment, are re-measured using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data. Estimated fair value of other real estate is based on\nappraisals. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there\nwere no foreclosed assets. There were no foreclosed assets re-measured during each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value\non a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are described as follows:\nCarrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, restricted securities, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest\npayable. The estimated fair value of demand and savings deposits is the carrying amount since rates are regularly adjusted to market rates and amounts\nare payable on demand. For borrowed funds and variable rate loans or deposits that re-price frequently and fully, the estimated fair value is the carrying\namount. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent re-pricing, fair value is based on discounted cash flows\nusing current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. For loans held for sale, the estimated fair value is based on market indications for\nsimilar assets in the active market. The estimated fair value of other financial instruments and off-balance-sheet loan commitments approximate cost and\nare not considered significant to this presentation.\nThe Company adds a servicing asset when loans are sold and the servicing is retained, and uses the amortization method for the treatment of the\nservicing asset. The servicing asset is carried at lower of cost or fair value. Loan servicing assets do not trade in an active, open market with readily\nobservable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model having significant inputs of discount rate, prepayment speed\nand default rate. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, there was no sale of loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company added servicing assets totaling $38,000 in\nconnection with the sale of a $5.8 million USDA loan. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company reversed $38,000 of valuation allowance\nfor the servicing assets. There was no allowance provision for servicing assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nFASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial\nassets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The estimated fair value\napproximates carrying value for cash and cash equivalents and accrued interest. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities that\nare not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are discussed below.\nSecurities held to maturity. The securities in this category include PACE and PID/TIRZ investments. These investment contracts or bonds originate\nunder a contractual obligation between the property owners, the local county administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. The fair value\nof these investments are estimated using observable market inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis.\nLoans. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit\nrisk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the\ncurrent interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality.\nDeposits. The fair values of demand deposits, savings deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand and, therefore,\napproximate their carrying amounts. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that utilizes interest rates\ncurrently being offered on time deposits with similar contractual maturities.\nBorrowed Funds. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for short-term borrowings. The fair value of long-term fixed-rate borrowings is\nestimated using quoted market prices, if available, or by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments. The\nestimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that reprice quarterly.\nLoan Commitments, Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit. Our lending commitments have variable interest rates and “escape” clauses if the\ncustomer’s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the following table.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCarrying amounts and estimated fair values of other financial instruments by level of valuation input were as follows as of the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, 2024\nCarrying Estimated\n(In thousands) Amount Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 126,540 $ 126,540\nLevel 2 inputs:\nSecurities available for sale 24,349 24,349\nSecurities, restricted 4,203 4,203\nLoans held for sale 22,794 24,942\nAccrued interest receivable 5,019 5,019\nLevel 3 inputs:\nSecurities held to maturity 24,219 24,245\nSecurities not readily marketable - -\nLoans, net 531,712 522,384\nServicing asset 304 304\nFinancial liabilities:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nNon-interest bearing deposits 64,705 64,705\nLevel 2 inputs:\nInterest bearing deposits 556,152 557,562\nBorrowed funds 21,000 21,000\nSubordinated notes 12,000 12,000\nAccrued interest payable 1,437 1,437\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying Estimated\n(In thousands) Amount Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 58,767 $ 58,767\nLevel 2 inputs:\nSecurities available for sale 22,977 22,977\nSecurities, restricted 4,176 4,176\nLoans held for sale 26,573 28,671\nAccrued interest receivable 4,829 4,829\nLevel 3 inputs:\nSecurities held to maturity 24,194 23,849\nSecurities not readily marketable - -\nLoans, net 494,787 484,848\nServicing asset 321 321\nFinancial liabilities:\nLevel 1 inputs:\nNon-interest bearing deposits 68,433 68,433\nLevel 2 inputs:\nInterest bearing deposits 458,458 459,549\nBorrowed funds 21,000 21,000\nSubordinated notes 12,000 12,000\nAccrued interest payable 913 913\nNote 16.

The Company intends to use its website as a\nmeans of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure).\nAccordingly, investors should monitor the Company’s website, in addition to following the Company’s press releases, SEC filings, public conference\ncalls, presentations and webcasts.\nOur website and the information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this Form\n10-Q.\nGeneral\nWe are a Texas corporation and registered financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. We provide a wide array of financial products\nand services including banking, trust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, third party administration, qualified plan recordkeeping and insurance\nservices to individuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States.\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and our\nconsolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial\nstatements and the notes related thereto in this Form 10-Q and in the audited financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nWe operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. (“TBI”), which was incorporated under the laws of the State of\nTexas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the registered bank holding company for T Bank, N.A. a national banking association (the “Bank”), (ii) Sanders\nMorris LLC (“Sanders Morris”), a registered broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and registered investment\nadvisor with the SEC, (iii) Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic Advisors”), a registered investment advisor registered with the SEC focused generally on\nmanaging money for relatively large, affiliated institutions, and (iv) HWG Insurance Agency LLC (“HWG”), an insurance agency registered with the Texas\nDepartment of Insurance (“TDI”).\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare consolidated financial statements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and to customary\npractices within the financial services industry. These policies, in certain areas, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other\nfactors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions\nabout matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have\nused for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period,\ncould have a material impact on the financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–- Credit Losses (Topic 326) (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments, effective on January 1, 2023, pursuant to the delayed adoption allowable for smaller reporting companies, and replaces allowance allocations\ncalculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables, and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\ndiscussed in the 2023 Form 10-K. Upon adoption of the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology, the Company recorded an increase of $1.4\nmillion to the allowance for credit losses for loans and $237,505 to the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments. In addition, the Company\nrecognized a cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling $1.3 million, net of a recorded deferred tax asset of $341,662. See the discussion in\nNote 1–- Organization and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3–- Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to\nconsolidated financial statements for more details on the impact of the Company’s adoption of the CECL methodology, including related accounting\npolicies.\n34\nTable of Contents\nPerformance Summary\nNet income available to common shareholders decreased $1.6 million, or 37.2%, to $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared\nto $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.37 and $0.59 for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily the\nresult of a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense, an $839,000 increase in the provision for credit losses and a $203,000 decrease in non-interest\nincome, partly offset by a $59,000 increase in net interest income and a $436,000 decrease in income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various\ncomponents of net income are discussed below. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, annual return on average assets was 1.67%, compared to\n2.87% for the same period in the prior year, and annual return on average equity was 11.50%, compared to 19.70% for the same period in the prior year.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, this Form 10-Q contains\nfinancial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, which includes return on average tangible common equity. We\ncalculate return on average tangible common equity as net income available to common shareholders (net income less dividends paid on preferred stock)\ndivided by average tangible common equity. We calculate average tangible common equity as average shareholders’ equity less average goodwill,\naverage core deposit intangible and average preferred stock. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity is\naverage total shareholders’ equity. We believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and\nratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures\nand ratios in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures\nand ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, measures and ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents non-GAAP reconciliations of annual return on average tangible common equity as of and for the periods indicated:\nAs of and As of and\nfor the for the\nThree Months Three Months\nEnded March 31, Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nIncome available to common shareholders (a) $ 2,673 $ 4,326\nAverage shareholders’ equity $ 107,013 $ 97,055\nLess: average goodwill 21,440 21,440\nLess: average core deposit intangible 341 551\nLess: average preferred stock 17,250 17,250\nAverage tangible common equity (b) $ 67,982 $ 57,814\nAnnual return on average tangible common equity (a)/(b) 15.81% 30.35%\nTotal assets increased $100.3 million, or 14.8%, to $777.6 million as of March 31, 2024, from $677.3 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was\nprimarily due to increases of $67.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $36.9 million in loans held for investment, partly offset by decreases of $3.8\nmillion in loans held for sale. Substantially all loans are secured by specific collateral, including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial real\nestate.\nShareholders’ equity increased $1.6 million, or 1.5%, to $108.5 million as of March 31, 2024, from $106.9 million as of December 31, 2023. See the\nanalysis of shareholders’ equity in the section captioned “Capital Resources and Regulatory Capital Requirements” included below.\n35\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nDetails of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing\ncash, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume\nand spread, and are reflected in net interest margin, as well as changes in average interest rates. Volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities. Margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, and is influenced by the level and relative mix\nof interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following tables present the changes in net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of interest-\nearning assets and interest–bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in\nnet interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average\ninterest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 vs March 31, 2023\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to Change in\nAverage\n(In thousands) Rate Volume Total\nInterest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold $ 193 $ 65 $ 258\nSecurities 83 21 104\nLoans, net of unearned discount (1) 1,597 1,426 3,023\nTotal earning assets 1,873 1,512 3,385\nSavings and interest-bearing demand 3 (3) -\nMoney market deposit accounts 512 370 882\nTime deposits 1,204 1,010 2,214\nFHLB and other borrowings (9) 181 172\nSubordinated notes 56 2 58\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 1,766 1,560 3,326\nChanges in net interest income $ 107 $ (48) $ 59\n(1) Average loans include non-accrual.\nNet interest income increased $59,000, or 0.8%, from $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $7.1 million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increases in the average volume of and average yield on loans, interest-bearing\ndeposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by\nincreases in the average interest volume of and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nwas 4.13% and 4.58%, respectively, a decrease of 45 basis points.\nThe average volume of interest-earning assets increased $67.4 million, or 10.8%, from $624.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, to\n$691.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included a $61.5 million, or 12.8%,\nincrease in the average volume of loans, a $4.1 million, or 4.2%, increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and a\n$1.8 million, or 3.5%, increase in securities.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets increased 123 basis points from 7.09% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 8.32% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to the increasing market interest rate environment over the respective periods. The average yield for loans increased\n129 basis points from 7.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 9.24% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The average yield on\ninterest-bearing deposits and fed funds sold increased 83 basis points from 4.67% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, to 5.50% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, and the average yield on securities increased 65 basis points from 3.46% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to\n4.11% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nThe average volume of interest-bearing liabilities increased $116.2 million, or 26.7%, from $434.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, to\n$550.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included a $101.5 million, or 24.4%,\nincrease in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits and a $14.8 million, or 200.3%, increase in the average volume of FHLB and other borrowings.\nThe average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 164 basis points from 3.61% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 5.25% for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024. The average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 171 basis points from 3.43% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, to 5.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The average volume of non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $61.0\nmillion, or 48.9%, from $124.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $63.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The average\ncost of FHLB and other borrowings decreased 48 basis points from 5.39% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 4.91% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and the average cost of the subordinated debt increased 187 basis points from 8.96% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to\n10.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to the applicable interest rates on the outstanding subordinated debt transitioning from fixed to\nfloating.\nThe following table sets forth our average balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, in addition to the major components of net interest\nincome and our net interest margin, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\n(In thousands, except percentages) Balance Interest Yield Balance Interest Yield\nAssets\nInterest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold $ 97,996 $ 1,339 5.50% $ 93,886 $ 1,081 4.67%\nSecurities 52,442 536 4.11 50,687 432 3.46\nLoans, net of unearned discount (1) 540,998 12,423 9.24 479,498 9,400 7.95\nTotal earning assets 691,436 14,298 8.32 624,071 10,913 7.09\nCash and other assets 50,123 47,870\nAllowance for credit losses (6,299) (4,964)\nTotal assets $ 735,260 $ 666,977\nLiabilities and Shareholders’ Equity\nSavings and interest-bearing demand $ 9,872 12 0.47% $ 12,664 12 0.37%\nMoney market deposit accounts 148,354 1,912 5.18 120,178 1,030 3.48\nTime deposits 358,457 4,679 5.25 282,365 2,465 3.54\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 516,683 6,603 5.14 415,207 3,507 3.43\nFFHHLLBB aanndd ootthheerr bboorrrroowwiinnggss 2222,,112266 227700 44..9911 77,,336699 9988 55..3399\nSubordinated notes 12,000 323 10.83 12,000 265 8.96\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 550,809 7,196 5.25 434,576 3,870 3.61\nNon-interest-bearing deposits 63,886 124,927\nOther liabilities 13,552 10,419\nTotal liabilities 628,247 569,922\nShareholders’ equity 107,013 97,055\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 735,260 $ 666,977\nNet interest income $ 7,102 $ 7,043\nNet interest spread 3.07% 3.48%\nNet interest margin 4.13% 4.58%\n(1) Includes non-accrual loans.\n37\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Credit Losses\nAs discussed in Note 1–- Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany adopted the CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2023. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology\nis applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as off-balance sheet credit\nexposures. Provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses for various types of\nfinancial instruments to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb expected credit losses over the lives\nof the respective financial instruments. Management actively monitors the Company’s asset quality and provides appropriate provisions based on such\nfactors as historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nFinancial instruments are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best\ninformation available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, forecasted economic conditions continue to remain uncertain\ndue to the continued elevated interest rate environment and persistent inflationary pressures in the United States and our marker areas. Accordingly,\nfuture provisions to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the\ndetermination.\nThe following table presents the components of provision for credit losses for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nProvision for credit losses related to:\nLoans $ 773 $ 43\nHeld to maturity securities - -\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures 144 35\nTotal $ 917 $ 78\nProvision expense for loans is generally reflective of change in loan volume and mix as well as charge-offs or specific reserves taken during the\nrespective period. Provision expense is also impacted by the economic outlook and changes in macroeconomic variables. The provision expense recorded\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024 was driven by the loss rate and charge-offs. See “Allowance for Credit Losses,” below, for further analysis of\nour provision for credit losses related to loans.\nChanges in the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures are generally driven by the remaining unfunded loan commitments expected to fund\nloans and to changes in the assumptions to project loss rates. The credit provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to decreased\noutstanding loan commitments to fund.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe components of non-interest income were as follows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nTrust income $ 1,739 $ 1,513\nGain on sale of loans - 581\nAdvisory income 3,938 3,451\nBrokerage income 1,782 1,890\nService fees and other income 2,950 3,216\nRental income 89 50\nTotal $ 10,498 $ 10,701\nTotal non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $203,000, or 1.9%, compared to the same period in the prior year.\nMaterial changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed below.\n38\nTable of Contents\nTrust Income. Trust income is earned for trust services on the value of managed and non-managed assets held in custody. Volatility in the bond and\nequity markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related fees. Trust income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $226,000,\nor 14.9%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in trust income between the periods is due to an increase in the value of trust assets\nover the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Volatility related to impacts of geo-political instability related\nto the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the potential for continued supply-chain disruptions, and regulatory action, including elevated market interest\nrates by the Federal Reserve aimed at tempering inflationary pressures in the United States, all of which are likely to impact the bond and equity markets,\nor other factors, could result in future net decreases in the average values of our assets held in custody, and/or in a decrease in net flows to our assets\nheld in custody, decreasing our trust income.\nGain on sale of loans. The gain on sale of loans primarily reflects the gain from the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) and USDA loans\noriginated by the Bank’s SBA lending group. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, gain on sale of loans decreased $581,000, or 100%, compared to\nthe same period in the prior year, during which there was a gain on sale of loans resulting from the sale of $5.8 million of USDA loans. There were no loan\nsales, and therefore no gain on sale of loans, during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nAdvisory income. Advisory fees are typically based on a percentage of the underlying average asset values for a given period, where each\npercentage point represents 100 basis points. These revenues are of a recurring nature but are directly affected by increases and decreases in the values\nof the underlying assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, advisory income increased $487,000, or 14.1%, compared to the same period in the\nprior year. The increase in advisory income between the two periods is due to increases in advisory assets between the two periods from net inflows and\nmarket appreciation of our advisory assets. Similar to our trust income, changes in the value of our assets under management will result in comparable\nchanges in our advisory income. Volatility related to regulatory action, including the effects of the persistent inflationary pressures in the United States\nand of elevated market interest rates by the Federal Reserve aimed at tempering such inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions related to\ngeo-political instability, including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, are likely to continue to put pressure on the financial markets and the\nvalue of and/or net inflows to our assets under management, potentially decreasing our advisory income.\nBrokerage income. Brokerage revenues are generally based on a per share fee or commission to trade a share of a particular stock, bond or other\nsecurity. In addition, brokerage revenues, in this context, include private placements, participation in syndication of public offerings, and certain other\nbrokerage revenues, including interest earned on margin lending. Brokerage revenue is dependent on the volume of trading, and on private placement and\nsyndication activity during the period, and in the case of margin lending, on asset volumes and interest rates. Brokerage income for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 decreased $108,000, or 5.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year.

The increase in trust expense related to increases in assets under management, and\nthe increase in brokerage and advisory direct costs was driven by an increase in clearing fees at Sanders Morris of $55,000, which was offset by\nindividually immaterial decreases totaling $6,000. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expense of $12,000 was driven by an increase in rent expense\nat Sanders Morris.

In making this assessment, the Company considers the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors for\neach security type in the portfolio. The issuers of these securities are U.S government agencies and continue to make timely principal and interest\npayments under the contractual terms of the securities. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the\ntime the underlying securities were purchased. Due to the low risk in these U.S. government guaranteed securities, no allowance for credit losses for\navailable-for-sale securities was recognized as of March 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of securities available for sale and\nsecurities held to maturity as of March 31, 2024. Yields are calculated based on amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity\ncategories based on their stated maturity date.

The average life of loans is less than their average\ncontractual terms due to prepayments.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNon-performing Assets\nOur primary business segments are Banking and Other Financial Services, and as outlined above, the Banking segment’s primary business is lending.\nThat activity entails potential loan losses, the magnitude of which depends on a variety of economic factors affecting borrowers and factor clients which\nare beyond our control. While we have instituted underwriting guidelines and policies and credit review procedures to protect us from avoidable credit\nlosses, some losses will inevitably occur.\nLoans are considered past due when principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments are contractually due.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan interest and generally when such loans\nare 90 days or more past due.\nForeclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less\nestimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses. On an\nongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs are provided for subsequent declines\nin value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties.\nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, accruing loans and factored receivables greater than 90 days past due, and foreclosed assets.

In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with\nASC 326, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When management deems\nall or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is charged-off against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the\nallowance. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326,\nreported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management’s best\nestimate of CECL on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to\ncredit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments\nto historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant\nfactors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a\nvariety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory\nauthorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 – Organization and Significant\nAccounting Policies and Note 3–- Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected\nin order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools. For dental and SBA 7(a) loans, the Company adjust\nthe pool life for expected prepayment speeds.\nFor all loan pools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate\nover two years on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver\nforecasts over the two year forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when\ndeveloping the forecast metrics.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.\nAdjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics. See the discussion of “Q-Factors,” below.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The allowance for\ncredit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the open pool method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an\nindividual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an\nallowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value\nof that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual\nterm excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt\nrestructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the\nreporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors (“Q-Factor”) that are not considered within our modeling processes but are\nnonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or\ndecrease management’s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks\nthat may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies,\nprocedures and strategies; (ii) staff experience; (iii) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (iv) concentration\nrisk; (v) trends in underlying collateral values; (vi) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; and (vii) economic conditions.\nUpon the adoption of ASC 326 effective on January 1, 2023, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated using the CECL\nmethodology increased $1.4 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated as of December 31, 2022 using the\nprior incurred loss model under GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses as of the date indicated and the percentage of allocated possible loan\nlosses in each category to total gross loans as of the dates indicated:\n(In thousands, except percentages) March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLoan Loan\nCategory to Category to\nAllocated: Amount Gross Loans Amount Gross Loans\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,231 15.3% $ 2,495 16.5%\nConsumer installment 15 0.1 18 0.2\nReal estate – residential 91 1.7 71 1.6\nReal estate – commercial 746 13.7 616 13.7\nReal estate – construction and land 142 7.0 143 8.9\nSBA 2,814 56.3 2,484 53.7\nUSDA 22 0.4 19 0.4\nFactored Receivables 669 5.5 462 5.0\nTotal allowance for credit losses $ 6,730 100.0% $ 6,308 100.0%\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents a summary of the Company’s net loan loss experience and provisions to the allowance for credit losses for the periods\nindicated:\nAs of and for the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023\nAverage total loans outstanding $ 540,998 $ 479,498\nGross loans held for investment outstanding at end of period $ 538,442 $ 455,186\nAllowance for credit losses at beginning of period $ 6,308 $ 4,513\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 - 1,390\nProvision for credit losses 773 43\nCharge offs:\nSBA 7(a) 56 -\nFactored receivables 357 109\nTotal charge-offs 413 109\nRecoveries:\nSBA 7(a) 13 4\nFactored receivables 49 32\nTotal recoveries 62 36\nNet charge-offs (351) (73)\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period $ 6,730 $ 5,873\nRatio of allowance for loans to end of period loans 1.25% 1.29%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans 0.07% 0.02%\nSources of Funds\nGeneral\nDeposits, loan and investment security repayments and prepayments, proceeds from the sale of securities, and cash flows generated from operations\nare the primary sources of our funds for lending, investing, and other general purposes. Loan repayments are generally a relatively stable source of funds,\nwhile deposit inflows and outflows tend to fluctuate with prevailing interest rates, markets and economic conditions, and competition.\nDeposits\nDeposits are attracted principally from our primary geographic market area with the exception of time deposits, which, due to the Company’s\nattractive rates, are attracted from across the nation. The Company offers a broad selection of deposit products, including demand deposit accounts,\nNOW accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans (such as IRAs). Deposit\naccount terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the\nassociated interest rates. Management sets the deposit interest rates periodically based on a review of deposit flows and a survey of rates among\ncompetitors and other financial institutions. The Company relies on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain\ndeposits, and also on CD listing services. As of March 31, 2024, deposits includes a $50.0 million brokered deposit through an Insured Cash Sweep One-\nWay Buy agreement.\n49\nTable of Contents\nTotal deposits increased $94.0 million, or 17.8%, to $620.9 million as of March 31, 2024, as compared to $526.9 million as of December 31, 2023.

The Company had no\nborrowings under this line from the FRB as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAs part of the BTFP, the FRB offered loans of up to one year in length to banks and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. treasuries,\nagency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral, which are assessed at par value. The Bank pledged AFS securities\nwith par value of $21.2 million to provide additional liquidity to meet the needs of depositors as of March 31, 2024.

The increase\nincluded net income of $3.1 million and $21,000 related to stock compensation expenses. The increases were partly offset by a $140,000 net after-tax\nincrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, the repurchase of common stock in the amount of $249,000 and dividends paid on the Series B\npreferred stock and paid on the common stock in the amounts of $388,000 and $710,000, respectively.\nTogether with the Bank, the Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could\nhave a direct material effect on the Bank’s and, accordingly, the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are\nalso subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of March 31, 2024, the Company and the\nBank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met the definition of\n“well-capitalized” under the applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the capital\nconservation buffer and the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions under the FDIC’s regulatory framework for prompt corrective action and\nthe Basel III capital guidelines.\nQuantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in\nthe table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), common equity Tier 1\ncapital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the\nregulations).\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios, as well as those of the Bank, as of the dates indicated:\n(In thousands, except percentages) March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTectonic Financial, Inc.\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 88,636 12.39% $ 86,847 13.97%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk Weighted Assets) 71,386 15.24 69,597 15.74\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 88,636 18.92 86,847 19.65\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 94,506 20.18 92,385 20.90\nT Bank, N.A.\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 89,972 12.72% $ 87,488 14.26%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk Weighted Assets) 89,972 19.43 87,488 20.04\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 89,972 19.43 87,488 20.04\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 95,777 20.68 92,957 21.29\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the regulatory\nframework applicable to registered investment advisors under the SEC’s Division of Investment Management.\nSanders Morris is regulated by FINRA, which, among other requirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital. As of March 31, 2024,\nSanders Morris is in compliance with its net regulatory capital requirement.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity relates to our ability to maintain a steady flow of funds to support our ongoing operating, investing and financing activities. Our board\nof directors establishes policies and analyzes and manages liquidity to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet normal operating requirements in\naddition to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable\nsupply of core deposits and funds. Ultimately, public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital\nposition. Liquidity management is viewed from a long-term and a short-term perspective as well as from an asset and liability perspective. We monitor\nliquidity through a regular review of loan and deposit maturities and forecasts, incorporating this information into a detailed projected cash flow model.\n51\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank’s liquidity is monitored by its management, the Asset-Liability Committee and its board of directors who review historical funding\nrequirements, current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated\nfuture funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments.\nThe Company’s primary sources of funds are retail, small business, custodial, wholesale commercial deposits, loan repayments, maturity of\ninvestment securities, other short-term borrowings, and other funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments\nare relatively predictable, deposit flows and loan prepayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions, and competition. The\nCompany will maintain investments in liquid assets based upon management’s assessment of (1) the need for funds, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields\navailable on short-term liquid assets, and (4) objectives of the asset/liability management program.\nAs of March 31, 2024 the Company had approximately $118.8 million held in an interest-bearing account at the FRB. The Company has the ability to\nborrow funds as members of the FHLB and the FRB. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $54.9 million based\nupon loan collateral pledged to the FHLB, of which none was utilized as of March 31, 2024.\nThe borrowing capacity on the discount line of credit with the FRB was $41.3 million, of which none was utilized as of March 31, 2024. During March\n2023, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP, which was made available to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system.\nThe BTFP allows the whole par value of available for sale securities to be included as the collateral value. As of March 31, 2024, securities with a par value\nof $21.2 million were pledged to the Federal Reserve under this program, of which $21.0 million was borrowed against. In addition, the Company has\napproximately $177.1 million of SBA guaranteed loans held for investment that could be sold to investors.\nManagement believes that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations. However, if general economic conditions, potential recession\nin the United States and our market areas, the impacts related to or resulting from recent bank failures and any continuation of the recent uncertainty in\nthe banking industry, including the associated impact to the Company and other financial institutions of any regulatory changes or other mitigation\nefforts taken by government agencies in response thereto, increased competition for deposits and related changes in deposit customer behavior, changes\nin market interest rates, the persistence of the current inflationary environment in the United States and our market areas, or other events, cause these\nsources of external funding to become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher\nfunding costs or operating restrictions in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company’s operations and growth.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers.\nThese financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements\nof credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the\nother party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those\ninstruments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of credit extended is\nbased on management’s credit evaluation of the customer and, if deemed necessary, may require collateral.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit of approximately $59.3 million and $162,000, respectively.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAllowance For Credit Losses–- Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is\ncalculated under the CECL model, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk\nresulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit detailed above. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by\nloan segment at each balance sheet date using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur\nbased on historical utilization rates. Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the impact of adoption was $238,000 to the allowance for credit losses\nfor off-balance-sheet credit exposure. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled $337,000 and $192,000 at March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a credit loss expense related to off-\nbalance-sheet credit exposures totaling $144,000 and $35,000, respectively. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate\nthe allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying\nnotes to consolidated financial statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nAs a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability management policy provides management\nwith guidelines for effective funds management and we have established a measurement system for monitoring the net interest rate sensitivity position.\nFluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market\nvalue of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of\neconomic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of\ncurrent fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while\nat the same time maximizing income.\nWe manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We use no off-balance-sheet financial\ninstruments to manage interest rate risk.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank’s Asset Liability Committee in accordance with policies approved by the Bank’s board of\ndirectors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the\ncommittee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, liquidity, business\nstrategies and other factors.\nThe committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market\nvalues of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments\nand borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity.\nWe employ methodologies to manage interest rate risk which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model.\nWe use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and\nthe impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot\nprecisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results\nwill differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and\nthe application and timing of various management strategies.\nOn at least an annual basis, we run various stress tests to measure the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market\ninterest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously, and ramped rates change over a twelve-month and\ntwenty-four month horizon based upon parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve\ncompared to a flat yield curve scenario. Additionally, we run non-parallel simulation involving analysis of interest income and expense under various\nchanges in the shape of the yield curve.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the impact of an instantaneous, sustained simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of\nMarch 31, 2024:\n% Change in Net\nChange in Interest Rates (basis points) Interest Income\n+200 10.85\n+100 5.47\n-100 (6.15)\n-200 (11.32)\nWe have found that, historically, interest rates on deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This\nassumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis, meaning that process by which we measure the\ngap between interest rate sensitive assets verses interest rate sensitive liabilities. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain\nand, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on\nnet interest income. Actual results will differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as\nchanges in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These\nrequire the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of\nmoney over time due to inflation or recession. Inflation generally increases the costs of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other\nassets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are\nmonetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of\ngeneral levels of inflation. In addition, inflation affects a financial institution’s cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits,\noccupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases in market interest rates by the Federal Reserve generally decrease the market value of\ninvestments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings and shareholders’ equity.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, an evaluation was performed by the Company, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its\ndisclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and\nmanagement was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act) were effective at the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n54\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are involved, from time to time, as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of its business. Based on the\ninformation presently available, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse\neffect on the business’s financial condition or results of operations of the Company on a consolidated basis.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn evaluating an investment in any of our securities, investors should consider carefully, among other things, information under the heading\n“Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations,” of this Form 10-Q and the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

Business.\nOur Company\nTectonic Financial, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas offering banking, trust,\ninvestment advisory, third-party administration and recordkeeping, securities brokerage, underwriting, and insurance services to high net worth\nindividuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States. The Company was formed in late 2016 for the purpose of acquiring T Bancshares,\nInc. (“T Bancshares”), and its wholly owned subsidiary, T Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). T Bancshares was incorporated under the laws of the\nState of Texas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the bank holding company for the Bank. On May 13, 2019, we completed a merger with Tectonic\nHoldings, LLC (“Tectonic Holdings”), a company with whom we had common ownership (the “Tectonic Merger”). Through the Tectonic Merger, we\nacquired Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic Advisors”) and Sanders Morris LLC (“Sanders Morris”), as well as its subsidiary, HWG Insurance Agency\nLLC (“HWG”), which expanded our financial services to include investment advisory, securities brokerage, investment banking, and insurance services.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had, on a consolidated basis, $677.3 million in assets, $494.8 million in total loans held for investment, $26.6 million in\nloans held for sale, $526.9 million in deposits and $106.9 million in shareholders’ equity. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $15.2\nmillion. The Company’s Series B preferred stock is traded through the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “TECTP”.\nOperating Segments\nOverview\nWe operate through three business segments: Banking, Other Financial Services, and HoldCo operations.\n● Our Banking segment operates through the Bank, a full-service, nationally chartered commercial bank headquartered in Dallas, Texas providing\ntraditional community banking services, as well as factoring services through the Bank’s Integra Factoring Division. The Bank’s Trust Division is\nwithin our Other Financial Services segment below.\n● Our Other Financial Services segment includes Tectonic Advisors, Sanders Morris, HWG and the Bank’s Trust Division, which includes a third-\nparty administrator (“TPA”) services unit:\no Tectonic Advisors is a registered investment advisor providing investment advisory services to individuals, institutions (including\naffiliates) and families. It advises on portfolios of assets for an asset-based fee. As of December 31, 2023, Tectonic Advisors had\napproximately $3.6 billion in client assets under management (“AUM”) (which includes $1.8 billion of AUM held by the Bank as a fiduciary).\no Sanders Morris is a registered broker-dealer with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and registered investment advisor\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Through Sanders Morris, we serve clients on their investment portfolios as an\nadvisor or broker (often with limited powers of attorney). We also execute trades for institutions and households, and provide investment\nbanking services to corporate entities. As of December 31, 2023, Sanders Morris had approximately $1.2 billion in client advisory assets\nunder management, and client brokerage assets of $2.0 billion, bringing total client assets to $3.2 billion at Sanders Morris.\no HWG is an insurance agency registered with the Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”), and is focused on offering life and disability\ncoverages.\no The Bank’s Trust Division provides private trust services, and also includes a TPA services unit providing retirement plan design and\nadministrative services.\n● Our Holdco segment, HoldCo, includes the Bank’s immediate parent and related subordinated debt, as well as operations of Tectonic Financial,\nInc., the financial holding company that serves as parent for the group overall. Its principal source of revenue is dividends from our subsidiaries.\n6\nTable of Contents\nBanking\nGeneral. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of commercial and consumer banking services to small- to medium-sized\nbusinesses, single-family residential and commercial contractors and consumers. The Bank strives to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on assets\nand capital by providing niche lending services and generating significant non-interest income through its factoring and trust services. Lending services\ninclude commercial loans to small- to medium-sized businesses and professional concerns as well as consumers. The Bank offers a wide range of deposit\nservices including demand deposits, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit with\nfixed rates and a range of maturity options. The Bank also offers trust services. These services are provided through a variety of delivery systems\nincluding automated teller machines, mobile banking and internet banking.\nLending Services. From its single location, the Bank operates three lending verticals where it has established expertise: SBA and U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (“USDA”), dental and other professionals and traditional community banking. We believe our lending products provide an important\ndiversity of risk and opportunity, which differentiates us from most community banks our size. The Bank also offers factoring services through its Integra\nDivision. See the discussion of “Factored Receivables” below.\nSBA and USDA. The Bank originates and services commercial and real estate loans under programs guaranteed by the SBA and the USDA\nrepresenting approximately 54.1% of the Bank’s total lending services as of December 31, 2023. Generally 75% to 80% of the principal balance of these\nloans is guaranteed by these agencies. The CARES Act increased the SBA 7(a) guaranty on 7(a) loans to 90% for loans originated from February 1, 2020\nthrough September 30, 2021. These loans generally offer borrowers more flexible terms and conditions than available through conventional commercial\nloans. Examples of more flexible terms include longer amortization periods, lower required down payments, and less borrower operating history. These\nloans are generally secured by equipment, real estate, and other tangible collateral. Loan-to-value ratios may, in some instances, be higher than\nconventional loans. Loans secured by business assets that do not include real estate have terms that are generally not more than 10 years and are fully\namortizing. Loans secured by real estate as the principal collateral are generally 25 years or less and are also generally fully amortizing. Loans can be\nadjustable rate loans, but may also be fixed for the term of the loan. Repayment of the loans is based on an analysis of the borrower’s ability to generate\nsufficient income from operations. This analysis may rely more heavily on projected future earnings than on conventional loans. The Bank also analyzes\nthe industry sector to determine the feasibility of the projected income.\nThere is generally an active secondary market for the guaranteed portion of these loans. Because the guaranteed portion carries the full faith and\ncredit guarantee of an agency of the U.S. government, the guaranteed portion of the loan can generally be sold for a premium at the time of the sale. We\nmay sell the guaranteed portion or retain the guaranteed portion on our balance sheet based on, among other things, our view of the premiums being paid\nfor such guaranteed portions, our desire to generate additional capital for the Bank and/or the funding costs and sources to fund such loans. As the\nguaranteed portion of the SBA/USDA loans age, the premium that such portions can generate typically declines. Therefore, we typically make the\ndetermination about whether to sell the guaranteed portion of such loans shortly after such loans are certified as guaranteed by either the SBA or USDA,\nas applicable.\nDental and Other Professionals. The Bank offers loans to the dental industry and other small-to-medium sized businesses. The principal referral\nsource of the dental loans is Cain Watters. Most of the partners of Cain Watters are stockholders in the Company, and four partners serve on our board of\ndirectors. Cain Watters has been highly successful in providing a variety of consulting services to dentists and dental companies for over 30 years with a\nnational client base. Cain Watters refers loans to a variety of lenders (including the Bank), who compete on price, terms and service. We view the dental\nlending vertical as highly competitive.\nTraditional Community Banking. The Bank offers traditional lending services, including commercial and industrial, commercial real estate,\nconstruction and, on a very limited basis, consumer loans (each as further described below). The majority of these loans are to commercial enterprises in\nthe Dallas, Texas area.\n7\nTable of Contents\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. Loans for commercial purposes in various lines of businesses are a major component of the Bank’s loan portfolio.\nThe targets in the commercial loan markets are retail establishments, professional service providers, in particular dentists, and small- to medium-sized\nbusinesses. See “—Dental and Other Professionals” above. Commercial lending generally involves greater credit risk than residential mortgage or\nconsumer lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with commercial real estate lending. The terms of these loans vary by\npurpose and by type of underlying collateral, if any. The commercial loans are primarily underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the\nloan from income and their creditworthiness. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of\ncollateral in the event of a borrower default may represent an insufficient source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may, among\nother things, be obsolete or of limited use. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash\nflow of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment. On some of these loans, the\nBank takes a security interest in real estate as a prudent practice and measure and not as the principal collateral for the loan.\nThe Bank will typically make equipment loans for a fixed term of generally not more than 10 years at fixed or variable rates, with the loan fully\namortized over the term. Loans to support working capital will typically have terms not exceeding one year and will usually be secured by accounts\nreceivable, inventory or personal guarantees of the principals of the business. For loans secured by accounts receivable or inventory, principal will\ntypically be repaid or reduced with cash generated as the accounts receivable and/or inventory is converted into cash, and for loans secured with other\ntypes of collateral, principal will typically be repaid over the term of the loan or due at maturity.\nReal Estate Loans. The Bank makes owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, residential and commercial construction\nand development loans, and residential real estate loans. The Bank often uses appraisals to assess the collateral value of such real estate. However, the\nCompany’s use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral if\nit must ultimately be foreclosed upon and sold.\nCommercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loan terms generally are limited to 25 years or less. Interest rates may be fixed or adjustable, although\nrates typically are not fixed for loans with maturity dates exceeding 10 years. The Bank generally requires personal guarantees from the principal owners\nof the property supported by a review by the Bank’s management of the principal owners’ personal financial statements. Risks associated with commercial\nreal estate loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, tenant vacancy rates and the quality of the borrower’s management.\nResidential Real Estate. The Bank’s residential real estate loans consist of loans to acquire and renovate existing homes for subsequent re-sale,\nresidential new construction loans, residential loans purchased in the secondary market, residential rental properties, and on a limited basis, traditional\nmortgage lending for one-to-four family owner occupied property. Loans are generally made in accordance with the Bank’s appraisal and loan policy with\nthe ratio of the loan principal to the value of collateral (typically established by independent appraisal).\nConsumer Installment Loans. On a limited basis, the Bank makes loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including\nsecured and unsecured installment and term loans. These loans are typically to the principals and employees of our business customers. Repayment of\nconsumer loans depends upon the borrower’s financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and personal\nhardships than repayment of other loans. Because many consumer loans are secured by depreciable assets such as boats, cars and trailers, the loan\nshould be amortized over the useful life of the asset. The loan officer will review the borrower’s past credit history, past income level, debt history and,\nwhen applicable, cash flow and determine the impact of all these factors on the ability of the borrower to make future payments as agreed. The principal\ncompetitors for consumer loans are the established banks and finance companies in our market.\nLending Policy. The Bank’s delegations of authority, which are approved by its board of directors, provide for various levels of officer lending\nauthority. The Bank has an independent third-party review that evaluates the quality of loans on a periodic basis and determines if loans are originated in\naccordance with the guidelines established by its board of directors. Additionally, our board of directors has formed a directors’ loan committee with\nmembers named by board resolution to provide the following oversight:\n● ensure compliance with loan policy, procedures and guidelines as well as appropriate regulatory requirements;\n● approve loans with net Bank exposure over $2 million;\n● monitor delinquent, non-accrual loans and classified loans;\n● monitor loan portfolio concentrations and quality through a variety of metrics;\n● monitor our loan servicing and review systems; and\n● review the adequacy of the credit loss reserve.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe believe we follow a relatively conservative lending policy, but one that we believe permits prudent risks to assist businesses and consumers in\nour lending market. Interest rates vary depending on our cost of funds, the loan maturity, the degree of risk and other loan terms. The Bank does not make\nany loans to any of its directors, executive officers or their affiliates.\nLending Limits. The Bank’s lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits. Differing limits apply based on the type of loan or the nature\nof the borrower, including the borrower’s relationship to the Bank. In general, however, the Bank is able to loan to any one borrower a maximum amount\nequal to either:\n● 15% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and allowance for credit losses;\n● 25% of its capital and surplus and allowance for credit losses if the amount that exceeds 15% is secured by cash or readily marketable collateral,\nas determined by reliable and continuously available price quotations; or\n● any amount when the loan is fully secured by a segregated deposit at the Bank and the Bank has perfected its security interest in the deposit.\nThese legal limits will increase or decrease as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases as a result of its earnings or losses, among other reasons.\nCredit Risks. The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans that the Bank makes is the creditworthiness of the borrower.\nBorrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the strength of the relevant business market segment. General economic\nfactors affecting a borrower’s ability to repay include interest, inflation and employment rates, as well as other factors affecting a borrower’s customers,\nsuppliers and employees. The well-established financial institutions in our primary service area currently make proportionately more loans to medium- to\nlarge-sized businesses than the Bank. Many of the Bank’s anticipated commercial loans will likely be made to small- to medium-sized businesses that may\nbe less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers.\nFactored Receivables. The Bank offers financing to smaller transportation companies across the United States primarily through factoring of\naccounts receivables through its Integra Division. We directly purchase the receivables generated by our clients, primarily transportation companies, at a\ndiscount to their face value. The transactions are structured to provide the clients with immediate working capital when there is a mismatch between trade\npayable payments to the client for services rendered and the required payment of operating costs, such as fuel and insurance costs, incurred to provide\nsuch good or service. The receivables are typically collected 30 to 60 days after delivery.\nInvestments. The Bank invests a portion of its assets in available for sale securities, which include U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agencies,\nmortgage-backed securities, direct obligations of quasi government agencies including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. In\naddition, the Bank may make investments in held to maturity assets, including certain municipal or state obligations or securities that it believes have a\nsimilar risk profile thereto. These investments include, among other things, securities issued pursuant to Property Assessed Clean Energy programs\n(“PACE”) and Public Improvement District/Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (“PID/TIRZ”) investments. These investment contracts or bonds originate\nunder a contractual obligation between the property owners, the local county or city administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor.\nGenerally, as a property assessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32 years by the then current property owner(s).\nInvestments in instruments other than U.S. Treasuries carry a degree of risk, including risk of default, market fluctuations and lack of liquidity.\nDeposit Services. To fund its loan and securities portfolio, the Bank offers a wide range of deposit services including demand deposits, regular\nsavings accounts, money market accounts, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit with fixed rates and a range of maturity options. In\naddition, the Bank can access uninvested cash from customers of its trust department by moving portions of it into money market deposits. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bank deposits included $31.3 million available from the funds of trust clients.\nIn addition to traditional lobby banking services, the Bank offers robust e-banking services, via on-line and mobile devices, to both consumers and\nbusinesses. These services include remote check deposits, bill payment, electronic transfer of funds between financial institutions, person-to-person\npayments, positive pay, as well as traditional internet services such as balance inquiries and internal funds transfers. The Bank provides a courier and\nmobile banking concierge service throughout the Dallas MSA and offers its customers free usage of any automated teller machine in the world through its\ndebit card. We also offer an on-line only option to open transaction, savings, and certificate deposits that is marketed via the internet to attract consumer\ndeposits.\n9\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank had total deposits of approximately $531.4 million which includes $4.5 million of intercompany deposits of the\nparent company and other subsidiaries, for a net balance of $526.9 million. Time deposits of $250 thousand and over totaled $109.6 million as of December\n31, 2023. The Bank had $50.0 million of brokered deposits through an Insured Cash Sweep One-Way Buy Agreement as of December 31, 2023.\nBorrowings. In addition to deposits, we utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the “FHLB”), and other borrowings, such as a\nline of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (the “FRB”) and borrowings under the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”), along with long-term\nsubordinated notes as supplementary funding sources to finance our operations. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings with the FHLB\nor the FRB under the lines of credit. The Bank had $21.0 million, or 3.7% of total liabilities, borrowed under the BTFP, and the debt at T Bancshares, net of\ndebt issuance costs, totaled $12.0 million, or 2.1% of total liabilities.\nOther Financial Services\nGeneral. We provide a variety of investment and insurance services to our clients through one or more subsidiaries, including investment advisory,\nasset management, stock and bond investments, institutional trading, private investments and access to public offerings and other investments. By\nproviding our clients with a broad array of investment products and services, we believe that we can attract clients seeking differentiated investment\nsolutions and retain them over a longer period of time. These services include:\nTrust Services. The Company provides trust services to individuals and defined contribution and benefit plans established by small businesses for\ntheir owners and employees. We have approximately 1,800 trust accounts in 48 states. The Bank has established common pooled funds to comingle our\nclients’ capital to invest in stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds or other investments and thereby provide a smaller investor with broader diversification\nand access to professional investment advisors. The Bank has approximately $1.9 billion in market value of trust assets as of December 31, 2023.\nWe currently have six common pooled funds for qualified plans and another three for personal trust (individual) investors. Each common pooled\nfund is established for a particular asset class or investment strategy, and each invests in stocks, bonds and/or exchange traded funds (depending on the\nfund’s strategy), often selected by a registered investment sub-advisor(s) retained by the Bank to serve the particular common pooled fund. The suite of\ncommon pooled funds provides an investor with the ability to diversify across asset classes (e.g., equities, fixed income or real assets) and managers. We\nalso have common pooled funds that invest in ETFs (as selected by Tectonic Advisors), which provide our investors with the ability to invest in passive\nportfolios. We believe that the benefit of a common pooled fund is that it provides investors with access to managers that might not be accessible to\nindividual or smaller investors, sometimes with a lower cost than in a mutual fund format.\nThe Bank has retained Tectonic Advisors under a long-term contract to provide investment advisory services in selecting managers and certain\ninvestments and constructing the allocations of the common pooled funds. The Bank generates fees by providing administrative services to the common\npooled funds and providing trust services to the plans and the individual investors.\nCain Watters has referred substantially all of the clients of the Bank’s Trust Division. Cain Watters specializes in providing financial planning,\naccounting, tax and advisory services to small businesses, principally dental practices. Cain Watters refers certain of its clients to the Trust Division to\nprovide custodial and fiduciary services for their defined benefit and contribution plans and also their personal assets. Cain Watters is not obligated to\nmake such referrals and refers its clients to other service providers that are competitive with the Bank. The Bank competes on the basis of service and\ninvestment performance. However, the Bank and Cain Watters are parties to an agreement which, among other provisions, obligates each party to\npreserve the other’s business relationship with their mutual clients. This agreement was renewed on December 1, 2022 under an automatic extension\nclause, and was subsequently amended effective January 31, 2023 to provide for termination upon the dissolution of either party or upon a mutually\nagreeable date in the event of the sale of the Company. The partners of Cain Watters own approximately 29.3% of the Company, and four partners of Cain\nWatters serve on the board of directors of the Company.\nThird Party Administration. The Nolan Company (“Nolan”), a TPA based in Overland Park, Kansas, operates as a department within the Bank doing\nbusiness under the name of The Nolan Company. Founded in 1979, Nolan provides clients with retirement plan design and administrative services,\nspecializing in ministerial recordkeeping, administration, actuarial and design services for retirement plans of small businesses and professional practices.\nWe believe that offering TPA services allows us to serve our clients more fully and to attract new clients to our trust platform.\n10\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Advisory. Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris are registered investment advisors regulated by the SEC. They provide investment\nadvisory and due diligence services to their respective clients for an asset-based or a performance-based fee.\nTectonic Advisors provides investment advice to the board of director’s trust committee in the management of its $1.9 billion of common pooled\nfunds under a long-term agreement that has been in effect since 2006, the current form of which renewed in December 2022 under an automatic extension\nclause within the agreement, and was subsequently extended effective January 31, 2023 to a duration that terminates upon the dissolution of either party\nor upon a mutually agreeable date in the event of a sale of the Company. Pursuant to this agreement, Tectonic Advisors provides investment advice,\nasset allocation advice and third party manager research for the construction of portfolios. Tectonic Advisors provides advice on six common pooled\nfunds, which are combined in various manners to develop different portfolios for investors (ranging from a conservative allocation to an aggressive\nallocation). Tectonic Advisors works with the Bank’s Trust Division, and the board of director’s trust committee, in the management of these common\npooled funds and portfolios and meets with the Trust Division and trust committee on a quarterly basis. In addition to services provided to the Bank,\nTectonic Advisors provides investment advisory research and due diligence services to Cain Watters under a continuing agreement.\nIn providing investment advisory services to individuals and families, Tectonic Advisors’ and Sanders Morris’ investment advisor representatives\nfirst determine the risk profile of the investor, which considers the age, investment time horizon, tolerance for risk and investment objectives. Once\ndetermined, the advisor makes a recommendation on asset allocation and populates each asset class (e.g., domestic equity, international equity, fixed\nincome, etc.) among mutual funds, exchange traded funds, common stocks and/or bonds, and alternative investments to provide exposure to each such\nasset class. The asset allocation and investments populating each asset class are revisited periodically based on interaction with the client, his or her\nchanging risk profile, investment performance, changing market conditions and/or other factors, as the advisor deems appropriate.\nBrokerage. Through Sanders Morris, we purchase and sell stocks and other securities for high net worth clients, often on a discretionary basis, in\nconsideration for brokerage commissions based on trading activity. In addition, we provide institutional trading and other services to money managers,\ninstitutions, and individual accounts. We also provide clients with access to private investments that are sourced by us in consideration for a placement\nfee or commission. Finally, we provide margin loans offered through our clearing firm (Pershing LLC) and periodically serve as a member of an\nunderwriting or selling group member in public offerings, which we offer to our clients. As of December 31, 2023, Sanders Morris has approximately $2.7\nmillion in net regulatory capital as defined by FINRA to support its broker-dealer activities.\nSanders Morris earns revenue by charging fees and trading commissions for managing the investment assets of clients. Fees and trading\ncommissions are typically charged based on trading activity and/or portfolio size. In addition, we also generate substantial revenue from a traditional,\ncommission-based structure where we earn commissions on client purchase and sale transactions. Sanders Morris also serves as a placement agent on a\n“best efforts” basis of private placements of equity and fixed income securities. Sanders Morris participates in syndicates of public offerings, typically as\na selling group member. Sanders Morris can also participate in public offerings as an underwriter, which means that Sanders Morris takes principal risk on\nthe placement of the securities but earns a higher fee.\nFinally, Sanders Morris has an institutional trading business, which is based in Dallas, Texas. This group provides trading, proprietary trading ideas\nand research, structured solutions and other financial services to clients that include: registered investment advisors, high net worth families and\nindividuals, money managers, hedge funds and others. This business typically charges a commission on trading activity. It competes on the basis of\nservice and solutions.\nInsurance. Through our insurance agency, HWG, we provide disability and life insurance as a broker. HWG is an insurance agency licensed under\nthe TDI. HWG generates its commissions through the sale of policies as a broker to clients and also receives renewal premiums from past policies sold\n(and which are renewing). HWG is currently generating most of its revenues from renewals, and continues to tailor its team to generate new business.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nThe market for financial services is rapidly changing and intensely competitive and is likely to become more competitive as the number and types of\nmarket entrants increases. The Bank competes in both lending and attracting funds with a wide range of financial institutions within our markets,\nincluding local, regional and national commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions. We also compete with consumer finance\ncompanies, pension trusts, mutual funds, insurance companies, mortgage bankers and brokers, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset\nmanagement and advisory firms, online and discount brokers, private trust companies, venture capital, private equity and hedge funds, asset-based\nnonbank lenders, government agencies, third-party payment processors, financial technology companies and certain other non-financial institutions,\nwhich may offer more favorable financing alternatives than the Bank. We believe that our principal competitive advantages include our regional focus and\nour long-standing relationships with our clients.\nIn addition, the investment services business (including brokerage, private placements, syndication, and other financial advice) is highly\ncompetitive. The principal competitive factors influencing our businesses are:\n● expertise and quality of the professional staff;\n● reputation in the marketplace;\n● existing client relationships;\n● performance of investment strategies or product offerings;\n● advertising and sales promotion efforts,\n● types, quality, and price of our products and services; and\n● the technology platform through which a customer accesses our products and services.\nThe financial services industry has become considerably more concentrated as many securities firms have either ceased operations, been acquired\nby, or merged into other firms. Many of these larger firms have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and can offer their customers\nmore product offerings, lower pricing, broader research capabilities, access to international markets, and other products and services we do not offer,\nwhich may give these firms a competitive advantage over us.\nAs we seek to expand our business, we face competition in the pursuit of clients interested in our services, the recruitment and retention of wealth\nmanagement professionals, and the identification and acquisition of other wealth management firms that can be integrated into our group.\nOur Market Area\nWe are based in Dallas, Texas, which is our largest market. The Bank’s principal banking markets include Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, Collin and Rockwall\ncounties in North Texas. However, our business is also national in scope. Our national business includes: banking for small businesses (particularly\ndental practices), SBA and USDA loans, trust and custodial services, and participant directed recordkeeping and third-party administration. In addition,\nwe provide investment advisory and brokerage services through Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe had approximately 199 employees as of December 31, 2023. We believe our employee relations to be good and we have no collective bargaining\nagreements with any employees.\nAs part of our business philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs in order to\nattract and retain employees who serve our customers, including competitive compensation, paid time off, an employee retirement plan, bonus and other\nincentive compensation plans, and modern equipment and support.\nThe health and well-being of our employees is a priority for our business. Our full-time officers and employees are provided hospitalization and major\nmedical insurance. We pay a substantial portion of the premiums for these coverages. We also provide other basic insurance coverages including dental,\nlife, and long-term disability insurance.\n12\nTable of Contents\nOther Available Information\nWe file or furnish with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports required\nby Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

As a registered bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve annual and quarterly reports of its\noperations and may also be required to furnish such additional information and reports as the Federal Reserve or the FRB may require. The Company\nelected to become a financial holding company in 2018, as further described under “—Financial Holding Company Status.”\nUnder the BHC Act, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of\nany class of voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control 5%\nor more of the class; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with\nanother bank holding company.\nUnder the BHC Act, any company must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank. For\npurposes of the BHC Act, “control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank\nor bank holding company, but may arise based on facts and circumstances even with ownership below 5.00% up to 24.99%. On September 30, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve’s final rule revising the Federal Reserve’s regulations related to determinations of whether a company has “control” over another\ncompany, including a bank holding company or a bank, for purposes of the BHC Act, became effective. The final rule created a tiered system of non-\ncontrol presumptions based upon the percentage of any class of voting securities held by an acquirer and the presence of other indicia of control. The\nfinal rule’s four categories of tiered presumptions of non-control, based upon the percentage of ownership of any class of voting securities held by an\nacquirer, are (i) less than 5%, (ii) 5% to 9.99%, (iii) 10% to 14.99%, and (iv) 15% to 24.99%. By codifying the non-control presumptions, the final rule\nprovides greater transparency with respect to the total level of equity, representative directors, management interlocks, limiting contractual provisions\nand business relationships that would be permissible to the Federal Reserve in order to avoid a determination of control. The Federal Reserve’s final rule\napplies to control determinations under the BHC Act, but does not apply to the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended (the “CIBCA”).\nChange in Bank Control Act. The CIBCA and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve require any person or group of persons acting in\nconcert (except for companies required to make application under the BHC Act), to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve before the person or\ngroup acquires control of the Company. The CIBCA provides that a person, which includes a natural person or entity, directly or indirectly, has “control”\nof a bank or bank holding company if it (i) owns, controls, or has the power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of the bank or bank holding\ncompany, (ii) controls the election of directors, trustees, or general partners of the company, (iii) has a controlling influence over the management or\npolicies of the company, or (iv) conditions in any manner the transfer of 25% or more of the voting securities of the company upon the transfer of 25% or\nmore of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of another company. Accordingly, the CIBCA requires that prior to the acquisition of any\nclass of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company that prior notice to the Federal Reserve be provided, if, immediately after the transaction, the\nacquiring person (or persons acting in concert) will own, control, or hold the power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or\nbank holding company. A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the CIBCA where a person (or persons acting in concert) controls 10% or more,\nbut less than 25%, of a class of the voting stock of a company or insured bank (i) which is a reporting company under the Exchange Act, such as the\nCompany, or (ii) such ownership interest is greater than the ownership interest held by any other person (or persons acting in concert).\n14\nTable of Contents\nPermitted Activities. The BHC Act also limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies. In general, a bank holding company is\nprohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding\ncompany or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, providing services for its\nsubsidiaries and various non-bank activities that are deemed to be closely related to banking. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and\nregulatory limitations under the BHC Act and the implementing regulations of the Federal Reserve.\nVolcker Rule. Section 13 of the BHC Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule,” generally prohibits insured depository institutions and their\naffiliates (including their holding companies) from sponsoring or acquiring an ownership interest in certain investment funds, including hedge funds and\nprivate equity funds. The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading, which could impact certain hedging activities. However, Section 203\nof the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) exempts community banks from the restrictions of the Volcker\nRule if (i) the community bank, and every entity that controls it, has total consolidated assets equal to or less than $10 billion; and (ii) trading assets and\nliabilities of the community bank, and every entity that controls it, is equal to or less than 5% of its total consolidated assets. As the consolidated assets\nof the Company are less than $10 billion and the Company does not currently exceed the 5% threshold, this aspect of the Volcker Rule does not have any\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at this time.\nFinancial Holding Company Status. A bank holding company may also elect to become a “financial holding company,” by which a qualified bank\nholding company may engage, directly or through its non-bank subsidiaries, in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to such financial\nactivity or in any other activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of\ndepository institutions or the financial system generally. A bank holding company can successfully elect to be regulated as a financial holding company if\nall of its depository institution subsidiaries meet certain prescribed standards pertaining to management, capital adequacy and compliance with the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), such as being “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” and must have a CRA rating of at least “satisfactory.”\nFinancial holding companies remain subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve.\nIf a financial holding company ceases to meet the above requirements, the Federal Reserve’s regulations provide that the financial holding company\nmust enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding\ncompany returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on its activities, and the company may not commence any of\nthe broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior\napproval of the Federal Reserve. Restrictions imposed on a financial holding company’s activities by the Federal Reserve may not necessarily be made\nknown to the public. If the financial holding company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the\nfinancial holding company’s depository institutions. Failure to satisfy the financial holding company requirements could also result in loss of financial\nholding company status. The Company made this election in 2018, and became a financial holding company.\nSource of Strength. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and long-standing\nFederal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any subsidiary bank. The holding\ncompany is expected to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position\nto provide such support. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its source-of-strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.\nThe source-of-strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies in situations where the bank holding company’s subsidiary bank fails to\nmaintain adequate capital levels.\nSound Banking Practice. The Federal Reserve also has the power to order a bank holding company to terminate any activity or investment, or to\nterminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or investment or such\nownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any subsidiary bank of the bank holding company. For\nexample, a holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank’s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their\ncustomers if the Federal Reserve believed it not prudent to do so.\nThe Federal Reserve has the power to assess civil money penalties for unsafe or unsound practices. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery\nand Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”), expanded the Federal Reserve’s authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-\nbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. FIRREA increased the\namount of civil money penalties, which the Federal Reserve can assess for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities\ncaused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1.0 million for each day the activity continues. FIRREA also\nexpanded the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed.\n15\nTable of Contents\nDividends, Distributions, Stock Redemptions and Repurchases. Dividends and distributions from our subsidiary companies are the Company’s\nprincipal source of cash revenues. The Company’s earnings and activities are affected by legislation, regulations, local legislative and administrative\nbodies and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to\nthe Company and the Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. Consistent with its policy that bank and financial holding companies\nshould serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay\ncash dividends on preferred and common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent\nwith the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of\ncash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with such\npolicy, a banking organization should have comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization’s objectives and\napproaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the policy statement.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on the making of distributions as a result of the requirement that the Bank maintain an adequate\nlevel of capital as described below. As a Texas corporation, we are restricted under the Texas Business Organizations Code (the “TBOC”) from paying\ndividends under certain conditions. Under Texas law, we cannot pay dividends to shareholders if the dividends exceed our surplus or if after giving effect\nto the dividends, we would be insolvent.\nIn the event that the Board authorizes the payment of a dividend by the Company, any such dividend will be consistent with our capital needs, asset\nquality and overall financial condition (as a financial holding company). However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future and, if\nit is found that our dividend is not consistent with our capital needs and/or asset quality or if our financial condition deteriorates, we may not be able to\npay dividends on our Series B preferred stock.\nBank holding companies must consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming or repurchasing any equity or other capital instrument included in\ntier 1 or tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity, if (x) such redemption or repurchase could have a material effect on the level or composition of the\norganization’s capital base, or (y) as a result of such redemption or repurchase, there is a net reduction of the outstanding amount of common stock or\npreferred stock outstanding below the amounts outstanding at the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. In addition,\nbank holding companies are unable to repurchase shares equal to 10% or more of their net worth if they would not be well-capitalized (as defined by the\nFederal Reserve) after giving effect to such repurchase. Bank holding companies experiencing financial weaknesses, or that are at significant risk of\ndeveloping financial weaknesses, must consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital\ninstruments.\nImposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), requires bank\nregulators to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. In the event an institution becomes\n“undercapitalized,” it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company\n“having control of” the undercapitalized institution “guarantees” the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes\n“adequately capitalized.” For purposes of this statute, the Company has control of the Bank. Under FDICIA, the aggregate liability of all companies\ncontrolling a particular institution is limited to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the\namount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. FDICIA grants greater powers to bank regulators in\nsituations where an institution becomes “significantly” or “critically” undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank\nholding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed distributions, consent to a merger\nor divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.\nAnti-Tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services, such as extensions of credit, to\nother services offered by the holding company or its affiliates. While we and our other affiliates offer services, no such services are tied to one another or\nconditioned upon one another.\nBank Regulation\nThe Bank is a national bank chartered under the National Bank Act. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve. In addition, its deposits are\ninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) to the maximum extent permitted by law. National banks, such as the Bank, are subject to\nextensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. As an insured depository institution and member bank, the Bank is also subject to\nregulation by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, although the OCC is the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The bank regulatory agencies have the power\nto enforce compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations. These requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves\nagainst deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating\nto investments and other activities of the Bank.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNational Banking Associations. Banks organized as national banking associations under the National Bank Act are subject to regulation and\nexamination by the OCC. The supervision and regulation by the OCC is primarily intended to protect the interests of depositors of the Bank, not the\nBank’s shareholders. The National Bank Act, among other things:\n● restricts investments and other activities of the Bank;\n● restricts the nature and amount of loans that the Bank may make and the interest that may be charged; and\n● requires the Bank to maintain reserves against deposits.\nDeposit Insurance. The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks, such as the Bank, and thrifts, up to prescribed statutory limits for each\ndepositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”), and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The Dodd-\nFrank Act set the standard maximum deposit insurance amount as $250,000. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution\nis based on the Bank’s total assets and its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. Under the Dodd-\nFrank Act, each institution’s assessment base is determined based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, and there is a\nscorecard method for calculating assessments that combines CAMELS (an acronym that refers to the five components of a bank’s condition that are\naddressed: capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity) ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures to determine\neach institution’s risk to the DIF.\nIn accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted a plan to restore the DIF to the 1.35% ratio but did not change its assessment schedule.\nUnder the FDIC's restoration plan, FDIC staff will update its projections for the DIF balance and DIF reserve ratio at least semiannually while the\nrestoration plan is in effect. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule applicable to all insured depository institutions increasing initial base\ndeposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC also issued a notice\nmaintaining a DIF reserve ratio of 2.0% for 2023. The increase in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio\nreaches the statutory minimum of 1.35% by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline set by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new assessment rate schedules\nwill remain in effect unless and until the DIF reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2.0% in order to support growth in the DIF in progressing toward the FDIC's\nlong-term goal of a 2.0% designated reserve ratio for the DIF. FDIC staff may in the future recommend additional assessment rate adjustments if deemed\nnecessary.\nSeparately, in connection with the U.S. Treasury Secretary’s invocation of the systemic risk exception declared on March 12, 2023, in response to the\nfailure of two insured depository institutions and the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for such failed insured depository institutions, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule in November 2023 that implements a special assessment to recover the DIF’s losses from protecting uninsured depositors following\nthe closures of such failed insured depository institutions. This rule is effective on April 1, 2024 and affects only those insured depository institutions\nwith more than $5 billion in total assets. Affected institutions must pay such special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, the first of\nwhich will be reflected on the first quarterly assessment period for January 1 through March 31, 2024, with the first payment due on June 28, 2024. This\nrule is not applicable for the Company. However, the FDIC also reserved the right to impose a one-time “shortfall assessment” at the conclusion of the\nspecial assessment if there are DIF losses that have not been fully recovered. It is possible that further increases in deposit insurance are adopted by the\nFDIC that could apply to the Bank.\nAdditionally, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution\nhas engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law,\nregulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\nPayment of Dividends. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company historically has received all of its revenue\nfrom distributions from Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris. However, to the extent the Company desires to have dividends paid by the Bank, the Bank\nmay be limited in its ability to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. The Bank is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the\nOCC to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of (1) the Bank’s net profits (as defined\nand interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (2) its retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two calendar years,\nless any required transfers to surplus. In addition, the Bank may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits (including the portion\ntransferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined by regulation).\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe payment of dividends by the Bank is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy\nguidelines and regulations, and the Bank is generally prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be\nundercapitalized. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the OCC may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank if the\nOCC determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III rules, institutions that seek the freedom to\npay dividends will have to maintain the capital conservation buffer.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. Under the Basel III capital regulations, the minimum capital level requirements are (i) a common equity Tier 1\n(“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. CET1 generally\nconsists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from\nregulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of\nCET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain\nconditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bank exceeded all Basel III regulatory minimum capital requirements.\nIn addition to the minimum capital requirements, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer that consists of additional CET1 capital greater\nthan 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares and paying\ndiscretionary bonuses.\nThe CET1 requirements also changed the risk-weighting of certain assets including a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility\ncommercial real estate acquisition development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days or more past due or\notherwise on non-accrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one\nyear or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are\nnot deducted from capital.\nCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio. On September 17, 2019, the federal banking regulators published final rules implementing a simplified measure of\ncapital adequacy for certain banking organizations that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Under the final rules, which went into effect\non January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and\nmeet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets and\ntrading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets, are deemed “qualifying community banking organizations” and are eligible\nto opt into the “Community Bank Leverage Ratio,” or CBLR, framework. A qualifying community banking organization that elects to use the CBLR\nframework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9% is considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital\nrequirements under the Basel III rules and, if applicable, is considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements for purposes of its primary\nfederal regulator’s prompt corrective action rules, discussed below. The final rules include a two-quarter grace period during which a qualifying\ncommunity banking organization that temporarily fails to meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the greater-than-9% CBLR requirement, is generally\nstill deemed “well capitalized” so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage capital ratio greater than 8%. A banking organization that fails to\nmaintain a leverage capital ratio greater than 8% is not permitted to use the grace period and must comply with the generally applicable requirements\nunder the Basel III rules and file the appropriate regulatory reports.\nAlthough the Company and the Bank are qualifying community banking organizations, the Company and the Bank have elected not to use the CBLR\nframework, but may make such an election in the future.\nPrompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Under applicable federal statutes, the OCC is required to take “prompt corrective action” if the Bank does\nnot meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized,\nundercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the OCC’s prompt corrective action regulations, an institution is\ndeemed to be:\n●“well capitalized” if it has a total capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and is not subject to a capital maintenance requirement;\n●“adequately capitalized” if it has a total capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater\nand a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater;\n●“undercapitalized” if it has a total capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5% or a Tier\n1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0%;\n●“significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than\n3.0% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and\n●“critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIf the Bank were to become undercapitalized, it would be subject to growth limitations and would be required to submit a capital restoration plan to\nthe OCC. The OCC may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to\nsucceed in restoring the Bank’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the Company must guarantee that the Bank will comply\nwith such capital restoration plan. If the Bank were to fail to submit an acceptable plan, it would be treated as if it were “significantly undercapitalized.”\n“Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient\nvoting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and\nother depositary sources, particularly if such deposits are higher cost deposits. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of\na receiver or conservator.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.\nInterstate Banking and Branching. Effective June 1, 1997, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-\nNeal Act”) amended the FDIA, and certain other statutes, to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines with\napproval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to May 31, 1997, expressly\nprohibiting interstate mergers. Under the Riegle-Neal Act, once a state or national bank has established branches in a state, that bank may establish and\nacquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or\nacquired branches under applicable federal or state law. If a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other\nstate may establish a branch in the state which has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo.\nHowever, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the national branching requirements have been relaxed and national banks and state banks are able to establish\nbranches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. The OCC accepts applications for\ninterstate merger and branching transactions, subject to certain limitations on the ages of the banks to be acquired and the total amount of deposits\nwithin the state that a bank or financial holding company may control. Since our primary service area is Texas, we do not expect that the ability to operate\nin other states will have any material impact on our growth strategy. We may, however, face increased competition from out-of-state banks that branch or\nmake acquisitions in our primary markets in Texas.\nRestrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank is subject to the provisions of Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the\n“Affiliates Act”). Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control with the\nbank. In our case, Tectonic Advisors, Sanders Morris, HWG and Cain Watters are all considered affiliates of the Bank.\nThese provisions place limits on the amount of:\n●loans or extensions of credit to affiliates;\n●investments in affiliates;\n●assets that may be purchased from affiliates;\n●the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; and\n●the guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate.\nThe total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all\naffiliates combined, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above\ntransactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the purchase or\nacquisition of low-quality assets from affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of Section 23A of the Affiliates Act, which now includes\ninvestment funds managed by an institution as an affiliate, as well as other procedural and substantive hurdles.\nSection 23B of the Affiliates Act, among other things, prohibits the Bank from engaging in any transaction with an affiliate unless the transaction is\non terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with\nnonaffiliated companies.\n19\nTable of Contents\nLoans to Insiders. Under federal law, the Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal\nshareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, (2) must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent\nas those applicable to comparable transactions with third parties, and (3) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other\nunfavorable features. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded coverage of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative\ntransactions (which are also covered by the expansion of Section 23A of the Affiliates Act). The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits an insured depository\ninstitution from purchasing or selling an asset to an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder (or any related interest of such a person) unless\nthe transaction is on market terms, and, if the transaction exceeds 10% of the institution’s capital, it is approved in advance by a majority of the\ndisinterested directors.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, have promulgated guidance governing\nfinancial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real\nestate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported\nloans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) and loans for construction,\nland development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more\nduring the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key\nelements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk\nassessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of\ncommercial real estate lending.\nOn December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.”\nIn June 2023, in response to the increased risk relating to commercial real estate loans, the federal banking agencies issued a final Interagency Policy\nStatement on Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Accommodations and Workouts. The new policy statement updates, expands on and supersedes\nexisting guidance from 2009 and supplements the guidance from 2015. Most notably, it (i) adds a new discussion of short-term loan accommodations, (ii)\nexpands guidance regarding the evaluation and assessment of guarantors to also encompass loan sponsors, (iii) incorporates information about changes\nto accounting principles since 2009, and (iv) updates and expands the illustrative examples of commercial real estate loan workouts.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company did not exceed the levels to be considered to have a concentration in commercial real estate lending and\nbelieves its credit administration to be consistent with the aforementioned policy statements and advisory guidance.\nBrokered Deposit Restrictions. Well capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized\ninstitution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and are subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid\non such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the\nBank qualified as “well capitalized” for purposes of the brokered deposit restrictions.\nTechnology Risk Management, Cybersecurity and Consumer Privacy. Federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements\nemphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with\nrespect to banks that contract with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions. The use of technology-related products,\nservices, delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, security, strategic, reputation and compliance\nrisk. Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology.\nOn July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted final rules that require public companies to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report\non Form 8-K and detailed information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance on an annual basis in an Annual Report\non Form 10-K. Companies are required to report on Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material within four business days of\nmaking that determination. See Item 1C “Cybersecurity” in Part I of this Form 10-K. These SEC rules, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to\nnotification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nUnder Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”), the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for\nfinancial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information,\nprotection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of\nsuch records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each\nbank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to\ncustomer information.\nUnder the GLBA, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices. Section 502 prohibits a\nfinancial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various\nnotice and opt-out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. Under Section 504, the agencies are authorized to issue\nregulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution’s ability to disclose nonpublic personal information\nabout customers to nonaffiliated third parties. Under the final rule the regulators adopted, all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices which\ndescribe in general terms the bank’s information sharing practices. Banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated\nthird parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with\ncertain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, or deposit or\ntransaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing.\nIn November 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint rule establishing computer-security incident notification requirements for\nbanking organizations and their service providers. Beginning May 1, 2022, a bank holding company, such as the Company, and an FDIC-supervised\ndepository institution, such as the Bank, are required to notify the Federal Reserve or FDIC, respectively, as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours\nafter a determination that a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident has occurred.\nAnti-Money Laundering. Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by\nProviding Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), and as further amended by the\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (the “National Defense Authorization Act”), and implementing regulations, certain types of\nfinancial institutions, including insured depository institutions, must maintain anti-money laundering (“AML”) programs that include established internal\npolicies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit\nfunction. Financial institutions are restricted from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced\nstandards for due diligence, client identification and recordkeeping, including in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. clients.\nFinancial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report\nany suspicious information maintained by financial institutions.\nOn May 10, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a final rule regarding customer due diligence requirements for\ncovered financial institutions in connection with their BSA and AML policies. The final rule adds a requirement that banks understand the nature and\npurpose of customer relationships and identify the “beneficial owner” (25% or more ownership interest) of legal entity customers. The formal\nimplementation date was May 11, 2018. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an\ninstitution’s AML compliance when considering regulatory applications filed by the institution, including applications for banking mergers and\nacquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be\nviolating these obligations.\nFurther, on January 1, 2021, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which enacted the most significant overhaul of the BSA and\nrelated AML laws since the USA PATRIOT Act. Notable amendments include (1) significant changes to the collection of beneficial ownership information\nand the establishment of a beneficial ownership registry, which requires corporate entities (generally, any corporation, limited liability company, or other\nsimilar entity with 20 or fewer employees and annual gross income of $5 million or less) to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN (which will\nbe maintained by FinCEN and made available upon request to financial institutions); (2) enhanced whistleblower provisions, which provide that one or\nmore whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information leading to the successful enforcement of violations of the anti-money laundering laws\nin any judicial or administrative action brought by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General resulting in monetary sanctions exceeding $1\nmillion (including disgorgement and interest but excluding forfeiture, restitution, or compensation to victims) will receive not more than 30 percent of the\nmonetary sanctions collected and will receive increased protections; (3) increased penalties for violations of the BSA; (4) improvements to existing\ninformation sharing provisions that permit financial institutions to share information relating to suspicious activity reports (SARs) with foreign branches,\nsubsidiaries, and affiliates (except those located in China, Russia, or certain other jurisdictions) for the purpose of combating illicit finance risks; and (5)\nexpanded duties and powers of FinCEN. Many of the amendments, including those with respect to beneficial ownership, require the Department of\nTreasury and FinCEN to promulgate rules.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOn September 29, 2022, FinCEN issued a final rule establishing a beneficial ownership information reporting requirement, pursuant to the CTA. The\nrule requires most corporations, limited liability companies, and other entities created in or registered to do business in the United States to report\ninformation about their beneficial owners-the persons who ultimately own or control the company, to FinCEN. On December 22, 2023, FinCEN issued a\nfinal rule regarding access by authorized recipients to beneficial ownership information that will be reported to FinCEN pursuant to Sec. 6403 of the CTA,\nwhich is part of the NDAA. The regulations implement strict protocols required by the CTA to protect sensitive personally identifiable information\nreported to FinCEN and establish the circumstances in which specified recipients have access to beneficial ownership information, along with data\nprotection protocols and oversight mechanisms applicable to each recipient category. The disclosure of beneficial ownership information to authorized\nrecipients in accordance with appropriate protocols and oversight will help law enforcement and national security agencies prevent and combat money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud, and other illicit activity, as well as protect national security.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with\ndesignated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC-\nadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i)\nrestrictions on trade with, or investment in, a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a\nsanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-\nrelated advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) the blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the\nsanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of\nU.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license\nfrom OFAC. The Bank is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting\nunlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions\ncould have serious legal and reputational consequences.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer\nfinancial protection with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority over a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks\nand thrifts, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act,\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Savings Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the consumer financial privacy provisions of the GLBA and certain other\nstatutes. Banking institutions with total assets of $10.0 billion or less, such as the Bank, remain subject to the supervision and enforcement of their\nprimary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws and such additional regulations as may be adopted by the\nCFPB.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of\ntheir entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The regulators examine banks\nand assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA then requires bank regulators to take into account the bank’s record of meeting the needs of its\ncommunity when considering certain applications by a bank, including applications to establish a banking center or to conduct certain mergers or\nacquisitions. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the CRA records of a bank holding company’s controlled banks when considering an\napplication by the bank holding company to acquire a bank or to merge with another bank holding company.\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations on a performance based\nevaluation system. This system bases CRA ratings on an institution’s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which\nthe institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements. The ratings range from a\nhigh of “outstanding” to a low of “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank had a CRA rating of “satisfactory” as of its most recent CRA assessment.\nAn unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nRegulatory Environment—We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to\ncomply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.”\n22\nTable of Contents\nRegulation Z. On April 5, 2011, the Federal Reserve’s final rule on loan originator compensation and steering (Regulation Z) became final. Regulation\nZ is more commonly known as the regulation that implements TILA. Regulation Z address two components of mortgage lending, i.e., loans secured by a\ndwelling, and implements restrictions and guidelines for: (i) prohibited payments to loan originators, and (ii) prohibitions on steering. Under Regulation Z,\na creditor is prohibited from paying, directly or indirectly, compensation to a mortgage broker or any other loan originator that is based on a mortgage\ntransaction’s terms or conditions, except the amount of credit extended, which is deemed not to be a transaction term or condition. In addition, Regulation\nZ prohibits a loan originator from “steering” a consumer to a lender or a loan that offers less favorable terms in order to increase the loan originator’s\ncompensation, unless the loan is in the consumer’s interest. Regulation Z also contains a record-retention provision requiring that, for each transaction\nsubject to Regulation Z, the financial institution maintain records of the compensation it provided to the loan originator for that transaction as well as the\ncompensation agreement in effect on the date the interest rate was set for the transaction. These records must be maintained for two years.\nUDAP and UDAAP. Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unfair”, “deceptive” or\n“abusive” acts and business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. Section 5 of\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act, referred to as the FTC Act, is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as\nUDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. UDAP laws and\nregulations were expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” referred to as UDAAP, and were\ndelegated to CFPB for rulemaking. The federal banking agencies have the authority to enforce such rules and regulations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act,\nCFPB looks to various factors to assess whether an act or practice is unfair, including whether it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to\nconsumers, the injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to\ncompetition. A key focus of CFPB is whether an act or practice hinders a consumer’s decision-making.\nIncentive Compensation Guidance\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking\norganizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation\nguidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and\ngovernance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an\norganization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (1) balanced risk-taking incentives; (2) compatibility with\neffective controls and risk management; and (3) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be\nincorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the\nincentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive\ncompensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, the Basel III capital rules limit discretionary bonus\npayments to bank executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds.\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NASDAQ, to implement listing\nstandards that require listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or “clawback” of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a\ncurrent or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement,\nincluding to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current\nperiod. The final rule requires the Company to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after such listing standard becomes effective. In accordance with\nRule 10D-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608, the Company adopted and implemented a compensation\nrecovery policy, effective as of October 2, 2023.\nOther Regulations. The Bank’s operations are also subject to various federal laws such as the:\n●Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine\nwhether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;\n●Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;\n●Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978 and its amendment, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, governing the use and provision of\ninformation to credit reporting agencies;\n●Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;\n23\nTable of Contents\n●Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for\ncomplying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and\n●Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to, and\nwithdrawals from, deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic\nbanking services.\nEffect of Governmental Monetary Policies. The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the\nmonetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount\nrate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of, and\nchanges in, reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign branches, the imposition of, and changes in, reserve requirements\nagainst certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings\ndeposits. Such policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits as well as the interest rates charged\non loans or paid on time and savings deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our\nfuture business and our earnings.\nEnvironmental Laws Potentially Impacting the Bank. We are subject to state and federal environmental laws and regulations. The Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, (“CERCLA”), is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present\n“owners and operators” of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term “owner\nand operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this\n“secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup\ncosts on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the property.\nRegulatory Reform and Legislation. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress, as well as by\nregulatory agencies. These initiatives and others may at times include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and\ndepository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes\nand the operating environment of the Company or the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease\nthe cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and\nother financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any\nimplementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory\npolicies applicable to the Company or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nBroker-Dealer Regulation\nThe securities industry is heavily regulated. The SEC is responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws and serves as a supervisory\nbody over all national securities exchanges and associations. The regulation of broker-dealers has, to a large extent, been delegated by the federal\nsecurities laws to the FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”). These SROs include, among others, all the national securities and\ncommodities exchanges and the FINRA. Subject to approval by the SEC and certain other regulatory authorities, SROs adopt rules that govern the\nindustry and conduct periodic examinations of the operations of our broker-dealer subsidiary. Sanders Morris is registered in all 50 states and is also\nsubject to regulation under the laws of these jurisdictions.\nBroker-Dealer Net Capital Rules. As a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, Sanders Morris is subject to certain net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. The net capital rules, which specify minimum net capital requirements for registered broker-dealers, are designed\nto measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to suspension or\nrevocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by other regulatory bodies, and ultimately may require its liquidation. Further, a decline\nin a broker-dealer’s net capital below certain “early warning levels,” even though above minimum capital requirements, could cause material adverse\nconsequences for the broker-dealer. Sanders Morris conducts business on a national basis as an introducing firm, using a third-party firm for securities\nclearing and custody functions.\n24\nTable of Contents\nBroker-Dealer Supervision. Sanders Morris is subject to other rules and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales\nand trading practices, public offerings, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, recordkeeping and reporting, and the conduct of directors,\nofficers and employees. Broker-dealers are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance\nwith many of the rules and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks because the rules and regulations are subject to varying\ninterpretations. Regulators make periodic examinations and review annual, monthly and other reports on Sanders Morris’ operations, track record and\nfinancial condition. Violations of rules and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of\ncease-and-desist orders, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar\nadverse consequences. The rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which are enforced by the SEC and FINRA, apply to the municipal\nsecurities activities of Sanders Morris.\nAnti-Money Laundering. Sanders Morris, like the Bank, is subject to the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act. These acts contain anti-money\nlaundering and financial transparency laws and mandate the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial\nservices companies. Sanders Morris, like the Bank, has established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). As a registered broker-dealer and FINRA member organization, Sanders Morris is required by\nfederal law to belong to the SIPC, which provides, in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, protection for securities held in customer accounts\nheld by the firm of up to $500,000 per customer, subject to a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances. SIPC is principally funded through\nassessments on registered broker-dealers. SIPC protection does not insure against fluctuations in the market value of securities.\nRegulation BI and Form CRS Relationship Summary (“Form CRS”). On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (“Regulation BI”),\nelevating the standard of care for broker-dealers from the current “suitability” requirement to a “best interest” standard when making a recommendation\nof any securities transaction to a retail customer. The “best interest” standard requires a broker-dealer to make recommendations without putting its\nfinancial interests ahead of the interests of a retail customer. The SEC also adopted Form CRS, which requires registered investment advisors (“RIAs”)\nand broker-dealers to deliver to retail investors a succinct, plain English summary about the relationship and services provided by the firm and the\nrequired standard of conduct associated with the relationship and services. In connection with adopting Regulation BI, the SEC added new record-\nmaking and recordkeeping rules. The compliance date for Regulation BI and the related rules is June 30, 2020, and Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors\nmet this requirement. Regulation BI imposes disclosure and policy and procedural obligations that could impact the compensation our wealth\nmanagement business and its representatives receive for selling certain types of products, particularly those that offer different compensation across\ndifferent share classes (such as mutual funds and variable annuities). In addition, Regulation BI prohibits a broker-dealer and its associated persons from\nusing the term “adviser” or “advisor” if the broker-dealer is not an RIA or the associated person is not a supervised person of an RIA.\nInvestment Advisor Regulation\nAs registered investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris are\nsubject to the requirements of regulations under both the Advisers Act and certain state securities laws and regulations. Such requirements relate to,\namong other things, limitations on the ability of investment advisors to charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to clients, record-keeping and\nreporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on principal transactions between an advisor or its affiliates and advisory clients, and general\nanti-fraud prohibitions.\nERISA. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and Sections 4975(c)(1)(A), (B), (C) or (D)\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are a “fiduciary” under ERISA\nwith respect to benefit plan clients or otherwise deal with benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Code impose certain duties on\npersons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients (including, without limitation, employee benefit plans\n(as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and provide monetary penalties for violations of these\nprohibitions.\nInvestment Advisor Supervision. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging\nfrom fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and\nregulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions,\ndisgorgement, fines or other similar consequences.\n25\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Regulation\nHWG is an insurance agency registered with the TDI. It provides life, disability, property and casualty insurance to clients. Regulation of insurance\nbrokerage is generally performed at a state, rather than a national, level. HWG operates in multiple states/jurisdictions, and as a result, both HWG and its\nemployees are subject to various state regulatory and licensing requirements. HWG monitors compliance with the various state insurance regulators, and\nalso has relationships with third party vendors to ensure compliance and awareness among HWG and its employees of relevant requirements and\nchanges, and emerging regulatory issues.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The material risks\nand uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware\nof, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Company’s business operations. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by\nthese risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some\nstatements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that we believe make an investment in our securities risky. This summary does not address all of the risks\nthat we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be\ncarefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding\nour securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business:\n● Liquidity risk, including our ability to maintain our deposit base or other funding sources, could adversely affect our ability to fund operations\nand hurt our financial condition.\n● We depend on wholesale funding sources, which causes our cost of funds to be higher and poses future funding risks if the Bank becomes less\nthan “well capitalized”, which may require us to liquidate loans or impede our growth.\n● We may not be able to grow and maintain our deposit base or other funding sources, and deposit outflows may increase reliance on wholesale\nborrowings and brokered deposits.\n● We are subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates could affect our net interest margins and net interest income, the value of assets\nand obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.\n● Our securities portfolio is subject to risk of loss; the fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\n● We are subject to consolidated capital ratio requirements and therefore have to hold additional capital.\n● If we are unable to sell additional services and products to existing clients or attract new clients in a manner that is cost-effective and assures\nclient success, we will not be able to grow our business.\n● We may not be able to implement aspects of our expansion strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings\ntrends.\n● New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\n● Acquisitions may subject us to integration risks and other unknown risks.\n● Growth of our business could result in increased costs.\n● The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Negative public opinion regarding us or failure to maintain our\nreputation in the communities we serve could adversely affect our business and prevent us from growing our business.\n● Significant revenues and profits are generated as a result of our relationship with Cain Watters, and a change in the relationship or decline in\nCain Watters’ business could adversely affect us.\n● We depend on key personnel, and may have difficulty identifying, attracting and retaining necessary personnel to execute our business strategy\nand successfully expand our operations. This risk includes the risk of retirement of key professionals in leadership roles, including loan officers,\nmembers of our SBA team, and financial advisors and brokers.\n● The employment market has become increasingly competitive; We may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled personnel.\n● A decline in general business and economic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\n26\nTable of Contents\n● Lower trucking margins and revenues negatively impact trucking industry and factoring.\n● Our business is concentrated in, and dependent upon, the continued growth and welfare of our primary market, and adverse economic\nconditions in such market could negatively impact our operations and clients.\n● We have a loan concentration related to the acquisition and financing of dental practices.\n● A governmental shutdown or curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect a segment of our business.\n● We face specific risks associated with retention of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans.\n● Commercial lending generally involves a higher degree of risk than retail residential mortgage lending.\n● The level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n● Our factoring services through the Bank’s Integra Division are concentrated in the transportation industry and economic conditions or other\nfactors negatively impacting the transportation industry could adversely affect our factoring business.\n● The success of our trust services is dependent upon market fluctuations and a non-diversified source for its growth.\n● We are subject to possible claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\n● We could suffer material credit losses. Our levels of nonperforming assets could increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations\nand financial condition, and could result in losses in the future.\n● Our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to absorb actual losses.\n● The small- to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business conditions, which may impair\ntheir ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n● Our commercial finance clients, particularly with respect to the Bank’s Integra Division, may lack the operating history, cash flows or balance\nsheet necessary to support other financing options and may expose us to additional credit risk, especially if our additional controls for such\nproducts are ineffective in mitigating such additional risks.\n● Certain of our loans are not secured by property but dependent on the earning capacity of the borrower.

Our principal sources of liquidity include earnings, deposits,\nrepayment by clients of loans we have made to them, and the proceeds from sales by us of our equity securities or from borrowings that we may obtain.\nIn addition, from time to time, we borrow from the FHLB. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the acquisition of national\nmarket non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as the FHLB, advances, access to the Federal Reserve discount\nwindow, the BTFP and the issuance of additional equity securities and/or debt.\nIf our ability to obtain funds from these sources becomes limited, these sources become restricted or are eliminated, or the costs of those funds\nincrease, or we are unable to effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, whether due to factors that\naffect us specifically, including our financial performance, or due to factors that affect the financial services industry in general, including weakening\neconomic conditions or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, then our ability to grow our\nbanking and investment advisory and trust businesses would be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects. Further, the Company may incur substantially higher funding costs in order to obtain the necessary funds to support\nthe Company's operations and growth or may be required to sell or restrict operations, or restrict the payment of dividends. Furthermore, if the Company\nis unable to raise adequate funds through external sources, the Company may need to sell assets with unrealized losses in order to generate additional\nliquidity, which could decrease the capital of the Company and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on wholesale funding sources, which causes our cost of funds to be higher when compared to other financial institutions and poses future\nfunding risks if the Bank becomes less than “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework, or PCA, which may require us to\nliquidate loans or impede our growth.\nWe use certain non-core, wholesale funding sources, including the FHLB advances and deposit listing services. As of December 31, 2023, our use of\nsuch wholesale funding sources amounted to approximately $286 million, or 51.8% of total funding. Although we intend to increase our efforts to reduce\nour reliance on wholesale funding sources, we may not be able to increase our market share of core-deposit funding in our highly competitive market area.\nWe further expect to increase our core funding as we develop the capacity for consumers to open on-line digital accounts. The rates on these digital\naccounts can be highly competitive and may increase our cost of funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income margins.\nListing service deposit rates are very market sensitive. At times, the cost of these funds can exceed the cost of core deposits in our market area as well as\ndigital deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income margins. Wholesale funding is subject to certain practical limits\nsuch as the FHLB’s and BTFP’s maximum borrowing capacity and our liquidity targets. Our maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB and BTFP is\nbased on the amount and fair market value and face amount, respectively, of commercial loans and securities we can pledge. If we are unable to pledge\nsufficient collateral to secure funding from the FHLB, we may lose access to this source of liquidity that we have historically relied upon. Additionally, we\nare required to establish limits on certain types of deposits including brokered deposits and listing service deposits, as well as total wholesale funding\nsources. If we reach these limits, future asset growth may be reduced or halted. If we are unable to access any of these types of funding sources or if our\ncosts related to them increase, our liquidity and ability to support demand for loans could be materially adversely affected. If we were not able to replace\nsuch wholesale funding, we may have to liquidate loans, which may be at losses that would have a material adverse effect on our capital, our business\nand your investment in the Company.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to grow and maintain our deposit base, and deposit outflow may increase reliance on wholesale borrowings and brokered\ndeposits.\nOur future growth will largely depend on our ability to maintain and grow our deposit base and our ability to retain our trust clients, who provide\ndeposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had a loan to deposit ratio of 93.9%. In the current environment of elevated interest rates, our deposits may\nnot be as stable or as interest rate insensitive as similar deposits may have been in the past, and some existing or prospective deposit customers of banks\ngenerally, including the Bank, may be inclined to pursue other investment alternatives, which may negatively impact our net interest margin. Additionally,\nnegative news about the Company or the Bank, or the banking industry in general, could negatively impact market and/or customer perceptions of the\nCompany and the Bank, which could lead to a loss of depositor confidence and an increase in deposit withdrawals. The account and deposit balances\ncan decrease when clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or real estate, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. In addition,\nif interest rates rise, competition for deposits may increase, which could result in clients moving money out of the Bank. As a general matter, deposits are\ntypically a lower cost source of funds than external wholesale funding (brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits\nare typically less than interest rates charged for wholesale funding. If, as a result of competitive pressures, market interest rates, alternative investment\nopportunities that present more attractive returns to customers, general economic conditions or other events, the balance of the Company’s deposits\ndecreases relative to the Company’s overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale or other sources of external\nfunding, or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future. Any such increased reliance on wholesale funding, or increases in\nfunding rates in general, could have a negative impact on the Company’s net interest income and, consequently, on its results of operations and financial\ncondition. Furthermore, the portion of our deposit portfolio that is comprised of large uninsured deposits may be more likely to be withdrawn rapidly\nunder adverse economic conditions. If our clients, including our trust clients, move money out of bank deposits into investments or to other financial\ninstitutions, we could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates could affect our net interest margins and net interest income, the value of\nour assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.\nOur profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income we earn as a result of\ninterest paid to us on loans and investments and interest we pay to third parties such as our depositors and those from whom we borrow funds. As\ninterest rates change, net interest income is affected.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including (among others) general and regional and local economic\nconditions, the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, bank regulatory requirements, competition from other banks and financial institutions and a\nchange over time in the mix of our loans and investment securities, on the one hand, and on our deposits and other liabilities, on the other hand.\nSustained low levels of market interest rates, as we have experienced prior to 2022, would continue to place downward pressure on our net interest\nmargins and, therefore, on our earnings. Conversely, increases in interest rates, though they could increase our interest margins absent a commensurate\nrise in our cost of funds, also have the potential to affect borrowers’ ability to repay, particularly for the small and medium sized businesses to which we\nlend, subjecting us to potential loan losses. This effect could be exacerbated by an inflationary environment. In 2022 and 2023, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (“FOMC”) of the Federal Reserve repeatedly raised their target benchmark interest rate in response to the ongoing inflationary environment in\nthe United States, resulting in subsequent prime rate increases of 525 basis points between March of 2022 and July of 2023. Further, substantially higher\ninterest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth and may encourage current borrowers to repay loans early. All of these\nfactors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable.\nOur net interest margins and earnings also could be adversely affected if we are unable to adjust our interest rates on loans and deposits on a timely\nbasis in response to changes in economic conditions or monetary policies. For example, if the rates of interest we pay on deposits, borrowings and other\ninterest-bearing liabilities increase faster than we are able to increase the rates of interest we charge on loans or the yields we realize on investments and\nother interest-earning assets, our net interest income and, therefore, our earnings will decrease. Conversely, in an environment of decreasing interest\nrates, loan originations may also decline, and our borrowers may experience difficulties meeting their obligations or seek to refinance their loans for lower\nrates, which may adversely affect income from these lending activities and negatively impact our net interest margin. These circumstances could not only\nresult in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also reduce collateral values and necessitate further increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, changes in interest rates\nmight impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and administration, which may have a negative impact on fee income.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFurther, rising short-term interest rates are likely to result in declines in both fixed income (bond) and stock prices. Declining fixed income and stock\nprices will result in a decline in the value and potentially the volume of both trust assets on which the Bank provides fiduciary services and the assets\nunder management at Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris, as well as declining capital markets, private placement and brokerage activities of Sanders\nMorris – as does an economic recession. This will have an adverse impact on the revenues and earnings of the Company. An economic recession will\nalso result in higher losses on the Bank’s loan portfolio and its factored receivables portfolio and decreased economic activity, both of which negatively\nimpact Bank earnings and capital. Thus, an economic recession negatively impacts almost every aspect of the Company’s business and will have a\nnegative and adverse effect on the earnings, capital and financial position of the Company.\nOur securities portfolio is subject to risk of loss; the fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $46.8 million. The Bank invests a portion of its assets in U.S.\nTreasuries, U.S. government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, direct obligations of quasi government agencies including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,\nand the FHLB, and federal funds sold. In addition, the Bank may make investments in certain municipal or state obligations or securities that it believes\nhave a similar risk profile thereto, or Other Securities. Other Securities include, among other things, securities issued pursuant to PACE and PID/TIRZ\nprograms. These programs are created by state and local municipalities to finance energy efficiency upgrades or renewable energy installations for\nresidential, commercial and industrial property owners. Investments in instruments other than U.S. Treasuries carry a degree of risk, including risk of\ndefault, market fluctuations and lack of liquidity.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence and cause adverse changes to occur in the fair values of securities in that portfolio. These\nfactors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the investment securities in our portfolio, defaults by the issuers of such\nsecurities, concerns with respect to the enforceability of the payment or other key terms of such securities, changes in market interest rates, continued\ninstability in the capital markets and lack of liquidity or marketability. Any of these factors, as well as others, could cause other-than-temporary\nimpairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As discussed above, the FOMC repeatedly raised their target benchmark interest\nrate in 2022 and 2023, resulting in subsequent prime rate increases of 525 basis points between March of 2022 and July of 2023, and further resulting in a\nsignificant increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2023. If market interest rates continue to rise, the market value of the fixed\nincome bond portfolio will decrease, resulting in unrealized losses, and depending on the extent of the rise in interest rates, the increase in unrealized\nlosses could be significant over the short-term. The non-credit portion of unrealized losses on the Bank’s available for sale securities portfolio are booked\nto AOCI, a component of shareholders' equity, and unrealized losses net of the related tax effect as of December 31, 2023 totaled $1.8 million, which\nrepresents approximately 1.7% of our total capital. A significant increase in market rates may have a negative impact on book value per common share and\nreturn on average shareholders' equity ratios. The Company’s bond portfolio is expected to mature at par and therefore the unrealized losses in the\nportfolio that result from higher market interest rates will decrease as the bonds become closer to maturity. However, if the Company were required to sell\ninvestment securities with an unrealized loss for any reason, including liquidity needs, the unrealized loss would become realized and reduce both net\nincome for the reported period and regulatory capital, which as currently reported, excludes unrealized losses on investment securities.\nIn addition, the process for determining whether an impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments,\nwhich could subsequently prove to have been wrong, regarding the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer of the security, the fair value\nof any collateral underlying the security and whether and the extent to which the principal of and interest on the security will ultimately be paid in\naccordance with its payment terms. Further, any loss from any such Other Securities or any other securities in our portfolio would negatively impact the\ncapital of the Bank and such impact could be material.\nWe are subject to consolidated capital ratio requirements, and therefore have to hold additional capital.\nPrior to our initial public offering in May 2019, the Company qualified as a “small bank holding company.” This meant, among other things, that the\nCompany was not subject to minimum consolidated capital requirements. Upon consummation of the Tectonic Merger, we ceased to qualify as a small\nbank holding company and must maintain certain minimum capital ratios on a consolidated basis with the Bank. As described further below, our failure to\nmeet capital requirements could, among other things, affect client and investor confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds, our ability to pay\ndividends on preferred and common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to sell additional services and products to existing clients or attract new clients in a manner that is cost-effective and assures client\nsuccess, we will not be able to grow our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new clients in a cost-effective manner and enable these clients to realize the benefits\nassociated with our products and services. Part of our strategic plan is to market our suite of financial services and products across the clients of our\nsubsidiaries. We may not be able to attract clients from one of our subsidiaries to use another subsidiary for different financial services or products. This\ncould be for a variety of reasons, including as a result of their continued use of our competitors and/or other impediments that hinder their ability to\nmigrate to or adopt our financial products or services. If we are unable to entice existing clients to expand their use of our financial products and services,\nwe may see an increase in our client acquisition costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our expansion strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings\ntrends.\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth at the rate we have enjoyed during the past several years. A downturn in local economic market\nconditions, particularly in the real estate market, a failure to attract and retain high performing personnel, heightened competition from other financial\nservices providers, and an inability to attract additional deposits in a cost-effective manner and lending clients, among other factors, could limit our ability\nto grow as rapidly as we have in the past and as such may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In\naddition, risks associated with failing to maintain effective financial and operational controls as we grow, such as maintaining appropriate loan\nunderwriting procedures, determining adequate allowances and complying with regulatory accounting requirements, including increased credit losses,\nreduced earnings and potential regulatory penalties and restrictions on growth, all could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial\nrisks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In acquiring, developing and/or\nmarketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction\nand development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove\nfeasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful\nimplementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could\nhave a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the integration,\ndevelopment and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in\nturn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions may subject us to integration risks and other unknown risks.\nAlthough we plan to continue to grow our business organically, we also intend to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe complement our\nactivities and have the ability to enhance our profitability and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. Acquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and we\ncannot determine all potential events, facts and circumstances that could result in loss or increased costs. Our due diligence or risk mitigation efforts may\nnot be sufficient to protect against any such loss or increased costs. Moreover, any acquisitions may require the approval of our bank regulators and we\nmay not be able to obtain such approvals on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn addition, certain events may arise after the date of an acquisition, or we may learn of certain facts, events or circumstances after the closing of an\nacquisition, that may affect our financial condition or performance or subject us to risk of loss. These events include, but are not limited to: retaining key\nemployees and clients, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting expectations and otherwise realizing the undertaking’s anticipated benefits; litigation\nresulting from circumstances occurring at the acquired entity prior to the date of acquisition; loan downgrades and credit loss provisions resulting from\nunderwriting of certain acquired loans determined not to meet our credit standards; personnel changes that cause instability within a department; and\nother events relating to the performance of our business.\n32\nTable of Contents\nMergers and acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the\nfuture and that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing\nshareholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of the Series B preferred stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate mergers,\nacquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such merger or acquisition, and we may incur costs in excess of what we\nanticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute mergers, acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could\nmaterially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business could result in increased costs.\nOur overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with the growth of our business are not matched or\nexceeded by the revenue that is derived from such growth. Further, expanding existing and/or new business lines may involve recruiting and hiring new\npersonnel. Hiring new personnel, especially professionals, is an inherently risky endeavor. The person needs to be a good fit within the organization, the\nperson needs to be able to execute within the Company’s existing corporate structure (which may differ from his/her previous place of employment) and\nthe person may need to attract his or her clients (and prospective clients) to the Company. If any of these (or other) factors do not occur, the Company\nmay have to terminate such person’s employment and/or such person may leave the Company, which means that the cost of hiring, compensation paid\nand/or termination costs (including potential litigation) may impact the Company’s results of operations in a negative and adverse manner. In addition,\nsuch personnel may be employed by competitors, and the retention of such individuals may require us to enter into guaranteed compensation contracts\nfor a period following commencement of employment. The compensation terms provided for in such contracts may be fixed in whole or in part. Any\nguaranteed compensation expenses that cannot be adjusted based on the success or profitability of the offices could reduce our operating margins.\nExpansion also creates a need for additional compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, and often involves the hiring\nof additional personnel to monitor such procedures. To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded\nbusiness, we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial\ninstitutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships, or the public’s perception\nof the soundness of the nation’s financial system. We have exposure to many different counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with\ncounterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other\ninstitutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services\nindustry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these\ntransactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral\nheld by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the receivable due us. Finally, if the public views\nthe nation’s financial system (specifically, small banks and/or investment companies) as unstable, customers might withdraw their funds, resulting in\nlosses. Any such forgoing losses could be material and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we do not provide custodial services for our clients. Instead, client investment accounts are maintained under custodial arrangements\nwith large, well established securities brokerage firms or bank institutions that provide custodial services, or, collectively, custodial firms, either directly or\nthrough arrangements made by us with those firms. As a result, the performance of, or even rumors or questions about the integrity or performance of,\nany of those custodial firms could adversely affect the confidence of our clients in the services provided by those firms or otherwise adversely impact\ntheir custodial holdings. Such an occurrence could negatively impact our ability to retain existing or attract new clients and, as a result, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n33\nTable of Contents\nNegative public opinion regarding us or failure to maintain our reputation in the communities we serve could adversely affect our business and\nprevent us from growing our business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion\ncan result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from\nactions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our\nability to keep and attract customers and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFurthermore, to the extent that depositors - particularly uninsured depositors - become concerned about the Bank’s financial condition or solvency, such\ndepositors could withdraw they funds and create a “run on the bank”. Although we take steps to minimize reputational risk in dealing with our customers\nand communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business. In addition, companies are facing increased scrutiny from customers,\nregulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy\ngroups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health\nand safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change\nand the adequacy of companies’ responses to climate change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities\nmay result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company’s preferred stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient\nprogress on ESG matters. In addition, new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding\nmandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational\ncosts.\nSignificant revenues and profits are generated as a result of our relationship with Cain Watters, and a change in the relationship or decline in Cain\nWatters’ business could adversely affect us.\nCain Watters provides advisory services to approximately 2,900 dental professionals across the United States and plays a meaningful role in referring\ntrust, TPA, participant directed 401k plans and lending business to the Bank. In addition, Tectonic Advisors generates a substantial portion of its\nrevenues and profits under a long-term contract to provide advisory and due diligence services to assist in the management of assets of clients of Cain\nWatters. In the event that the Cain Watters’ relationship does not continue (for whatever reason), such a change could have a material adverse effect on\nthe profits and operations of the Company.\nHistorically, the partners of Cain Watters had most of the client relationships. Thus, most of the referrals to the Bank and Tectonic Advisors have\nhistorically been through the partners of Cain Watters, each of whom has a relatively long relationship with the Bank and Tectonic Advisors and also is a\nshareholder of the Company. However, Cain Watters has experienced significant growth over the past few years and has expanded its client service and\nplanning teams to accommodate this growth. The leaders of these teams, called planners, are younger, have significant influence over clients’ decisions\nregarding service providers and are more technologically focused and, given this, may refer their clients to other providers at rates greater than historical\naverages, which would have (over time) a material adverse effect on the Bank and the Company.\nIn addition, Cain Watters is subject to, and has periodically faced, business challenges associated with litigation over private placements conducted\nby affiliates between 2006-2009, which were negatively impacted by the financial crisis and subsequent collapse in the energy markets, and lower assets\nunder management resulting from the market correction. Further, to the extent that clients suffer losses or poor performance on these or other\ninvestments, they may move their money from Cain Watters to another advisor, which could have a material adverse impact on Cain Watters and also the\nCompany.\nWe believe that any material adverse effect on the business of Cain Watters could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Cain Watters’\nbusiness is primarily focused on dental practices. To the extent that the dental industry is disrupted or dental practices are adversely impacted for\nwhatever reason, the Company’s business may be adversely impacted as well.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on key personnel, and may have difficulty identifying, attracting and retaining necessary personnel, to execute our business strategy and\nsuccessfully expand our operations. This risk includes the risk of retirement of key professionals in leadership roles, including loan officers, members\nof our SBA team, and financial advisors and brokers.\nWe are reliant on key members of our senior management team, business development officers within the Bank (who are critical to generating loan\ngrowth) and financial advisors and brokers (who are critical to driving asset growth at Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris). Personnel changes will\noccur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations and retirements will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional\nqualified personnel. With the exception of certain members of senior management, none of our professionals are subject to employment agreements and\nare free to leave at any time. Further, certain of our executive officers, financial advisors and brokers and SBA loan production officers are either\nfinancially secure or, in some cases, beyond retirement age for many Americans, and do not have to work. Thus, these individuals are more susceptible to\nretirement. Departures, particularly of key employees in leadership or client development roles, may cause client defections due to close relationships\nbetween clients and such professionals. While we have succession plans in place, the loss of any key employee may have a material adverse effect on\nour business and prospects. If we are unable to retain our key employees or attract, recruit, integrate, or retain other skilled professionals in the future, our\nbusiness could suffer materially in the future.\nThe employment market has become increasingly competitive; We may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled personnel.\nThe employment market has become increasingly competitive over the past two years. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the\nefforts of our professional team, including loan officers, members of our SBA team, and financial advisors and brokers. Therefore, our future success\ndepends, in large part, on our ability to attract, recruit, and retain qualified financial services professionals. Competition for the best people in many\nactivities engaged in by us is intense including with respect to compensation and emerging workplace practices, accommodations, and remote work\noptions, and we may not be able to replace personnel promptly at acceptable compensation levels or at all, and may have difficulty retaining them. These\ncircumstances have led to escalating compensation packages in the industry. Up-front payments, increased payouts, and guaranteed contracts have\nmade recruiting and retaining these professionals more expensive and more difficult and can lead to departures by current professionals. The unexpected\nloss of personnel could impact our ability to serve our clients timely, and could also negatively impact our internal operations, including regulatory\ncompliance. A lack of skilled, seasoned personnel with knowledge of our business and our market could reduce the performance of certain areas of our\nbusiness, increase our error rate in key areas, affect our ability to grow our business, and lead to a lack of talented professionals ready to advance into\nleadership roles in the longer term. Due to these potential effects, the tightening employment market could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in general business and economic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a business operating in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, our business and operations are sensitive to general business and\neconomic conditions in the United States, generally, and particularly the State of Texas. If the U.S. or Texas economies weaken, our growth and\nprofitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions could\nlead to credit quality concerns related to borrower repayment ability and collateral protection as well as reduced demand for the products and services we\noffer. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including global political hostilities, U.S. and foreign tariff policies and uncertainty over the\nstability of the euro currency, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder domestic economic growth. Concerns about the\nperformance of international economies can impact the economy and financial markets here in the United States. If the national, regional and local\neconomies experience worsening economic conditions, including high levels of unemployment, our growth and profitability could be constrained. Weak\neconomic conditions are characterized by, among other indicators, deflation, elevated levels of unemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital\nmarkets, increased delinquencies on commercial, mortgage and consumer loans, residential and commercial real estate, price declines and lower home\nsales and commercial activity. A significant outbreak of disease pandemics or other adverse public health developments in the population could result in a\nwidespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could\nadversely affect our customers’ businesses and results of operations. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the\nU.S. government and its agencies.\n35\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, declines in the U.S. stock markets directly impact our Investment Services segment and also our trust assets. With any such declines,\nour assets under management and advisement and trust assets decline in value and clients are less apt to invest. Since our investment advisory revenues\nare based on assets, this leads to a decline in our Investment Services and trust revenues. In addition, even though our brokerage revenues are not based\non assets, brokerage revenues may also be impacted by declines in the stock market because investors may be less inclined to trade stocks and/or bonds.\nSince our brokerage revenues are based on activity, we would likely see a decline in brokerage revenues as a result of stock market declines.\nIn recent years, economic growth has been uneven, and opinions vary on the strength and direction of the economy. Uncertainties continue\nregarding the potential for a renegotiation of international trade agreements and the effect of the legislation enacted by the recent presidential\nadministration, and the impact such actions and the policies of the administration of President Joseph Biden may have on economic and market\nconditions. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as the current conflict in\nUkraine and the Middle East or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact our and/or our customers’ costs, demand\nfor our customers’ products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nThe Federal Reserve’s recent unprecedented rate hikes in response to the inflationary environment may further impact our ability to attract deposits,\nand could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as increased interest rates could reduce the demand for\nloans and affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their indebtedness subjecting us to potential credit losses. Changes in any of these policies are\ninfluenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses\nto such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. All of these\nfactors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable.\nIn addition, the inflationary outlook in the United States remains uncertain. Inflation has been reported at high levels, and could result in higher\ninterest rates for a prolonged period of time, which may expose the Company to interest rate risk. In addition, higher interest rates could slow economic\ngrowth and lead to a recessionary environment, which could negatively impact the Company’s growth, credit quality, net interest margin and its financial\nresults. The risks to our business from inflation depends on the durability of the current inflationary pressures in our markets. Transitory increases in\ninflation are unlikely to have a material impact on our business or earnings. However, more persistent inflation could lead to tighter-than-expected\nmonetary policy which could, in turn, increase the borrowings costs of our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other\nobligations. High interest rates may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could also push down asset prices and weaken\neconomic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-\nperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLower Trucking Margins and Revenues Negatively Impact Trucking Industry and Factoring\nThe trucking industry, particularly over-the-road trucking, is a volatile industry and sees the freight rates increase or decline based on the state of\nthe economy, customer demand and/or supply and demand considerations in the trucking industry. During 2023, freight rates – which are the rates that\ntrucking companies charge customers for transportation services – declined by as much as 30% or more (generally) across the industry from their peak in\n2021, for over-the-road trucking. Thus, revenues have declined, on a per truck basis, for most trucking companies by 30% or more from their peak in 2021,\ncausing a significant decline in the amount of factored receivables. Further, diesel prices – a key cost of trucking companies – have continued to stay at\nelevated levels. The industry did see some relief as the price of diesel fell in 2023, but prices remain elevated as compared to prices in 2021.\nOur business is concentrated in, and dependent upon, the continued growth and welfare of our primary market, and adverse economic conditions in\nsuch market could negatively impact our operations and clients.\nAlthough we provide services nationwide, our business is concentrated primarily in the State of Texas. Our success depends to a certain extent upon\nthe business activity, population, income levels, employment trends, deposits and real estate activity in this primary market. Although our clients’\nbusiness and financial interests may extend beyond our primary market, adverse conditions that affect our primary market could reduce our growth rate,\naffect the ability of our clients to repay their loans, affect the value of collateral underlying our loans, affect our ability to attract deposits, affect the ability\nof our clients to make additional investments or cause such clients to withdraw their investments, affect the value of our assets under management and\ngenerally affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe have a loan concentration related to the acquisition and financing of dental practices.\nLoan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that\nwould cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. As of December 31, 2023, `our loan portfolio included $78.2 million of loans to\nthe dental industry, representing approximately 15.6% of our total funded loans. These loans include practice acquisition loans, dental equipment loans,\nand dental facility loans. We had no charge-offs during 2023 and 2022 in our dental portfolio assets. We believe that these loans are conservatively\nunderwritten to credit worthy borrowers and are diversified geographically. However, to the extent that there is a decline in the dental industry in general,\nwe may incur significant losses in our loan portfolio as a result of this concentration.\nA governmental shutdown or curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect a segment of our business.\nA major segment of our business consists of originating and periodically selling government guaranteed loans, in particular those guaranteed by the\nUSDA and SBA. From time to time, the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans. In\naddition, these agencies may change their rules for loans or Congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the\nloan programs. Non-governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers, but the terms might not be equally acceptable.\nTherefore, if these changes occur, the volume of loans to small businesses and industrial borrowers of the types that now qualify for government\nguaranteed loans could decline. Also, the profitability of these loans could decline. As the funding of the guaranteed portion of 7(a) loans has historically\nbeen a major portion of our business, a long-term decrease or discontinuation in the funding for the 7(a) loan program may have an unfavorable impact on\nour future performance and results of operations. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government\nshutdown could, among other things, impede our ability to originate SBA or USDA loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face specific risks associated with retention of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans.\nThe Bank has historically sold a considerable portion of the guaranteed portion of its SBA loans within a short period of time of originating such\nloans. Upon sale, the Bank retains the unguaranteed portion of such loans. As of December 31, 2023, the unguaranteed portion of our SBA loans totaled\n$64.9 million, representing 13.0% of our total loan portfolio. Given that the SBA requires that the Bank only make loans to borrowers that do not have\naccess to conventional bank financing, the unguaranteed portion of these loans carry greater risk than traditional loans. As the Bank’s loan portfolio of\nthe unguaranteed portion of SBA loans grows, its risk of loss due to defaults also grows. The Bank has a reserve for such unguaranteed portion of SBA\nloans. To the extent that this reserve is not adequate to cover losses, the Bank will suffer losses to its capital base and such losses could be material.\nCommercial lending generally involves a higher degree of risk than retail residential mortgage lending.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than owner-occupied residential real estate loans and typically have\nlarger balances. The underlying commercial real estate values, lower demand for office and retail space, increase costs to complete construction projects.\nCustomer cash flows can be more easily influenced by adverse conditions in the related industries, the real estate market or in the economy.\nCommercial real estate values may be elevated and the outlook for commercial real estate remains dependent on the broader economic environment\nand, specifically, how major subsectors respond to higher interest rate environment and prices for commodities, goods and services. Credit performance\nacross the industry over the medium- and long-term is susceptible to economic and market forces. Some degree of general instability in the broad\ncommercial real estate market may occur in the coming quarters as loans are refinanced at higher interest rates and in markets with higher vacancy rates\nunder current economic conditions. Instability and uncertainty in the commercial real estate markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny.\nThe banking regulators have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in\ncommercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk\nassessment to identify potential concentrations in commercial real estate lending. A financial institution may have such a concentration if, among other\nfactors: (i) total outstanding loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital (“CRE 1\nConcentration”); or (ii) total outstanding loans for construction, land development and other land and loans secured by multifamily and non-owner\noccupied non-farm, non-residential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital\n(“CRE 2 Concentration”), and the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. In\nsuch an instance, management should employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight and strategic planning,\ndevelopment of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. As of December 31, 2023, our CRE 1\nConcentration level was 84.33% and our CRE 2 Concentration level was 112.7%. We may, at some point, be considered to have a concentration in the\nfuture, or our risk management practices may be found to be deficient, which could result in increased reserves and capital costs as well as potential\nregulatory enforcement action.\nOur factoring services through the Bank’s Integra factoring division are concentrated in the transportation industry and economic conditions or\nother factors negatively impacting the transportation industry could adversely affect our factoring business; factoring invoice levels are at historical\nhighs.\nFactoring for small-sized trucking businesses constituted the vast majority of our total factoring portfolio as of December 31, 2023, calculated based\non the gross receivables from the purchase of invoices from such trucking businesses compared to our total gross receivables in the purchase of factored\nreceivables as of such date. The Company began providing factoring services for the energy industry and the staffing industry during 2023, and as of\nDecember 31, 2023, these services constitute approximately 10% of the Company’s total factoring portfolio. Given the concentration of our factoring\nbusiness in the transportation industry, economic conditions or other factors that negatively impact the transportation industry could impact our\nfactoring revenues, as the revenues we earn from purchasing transportation invoices are directly correlated with the amount of transportation activity\ngenerated by our factoring clients (i.e., the volume of transportation invoices they are able to generate by providing their services). Reductions in\neconomic activity will typically cause a decrease in the volume of goods in commerce available to be transported by our factoring clients. Increased costs\nassociated with operating a trucking business, such as may be caused by increases in the prices of oil and diesel fuel, may cause a diminished demand for\ntrucking services as our clients pass those costs along to their customers. Conversely, decreases in the price of diesel fuel may cause the size of our\nfactoring portfolio to decrease, as the price of diesel fuel typically directly correlates with the size of the invoices we purchase from our factoring clients.\nAdditionally, the factoring industry may not continue its historical growth and we may face increased competition. Our failure to compete effectively in\nour market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share. Any of such events could impact the returns we realize on our factoring activity or\nresult in a decrease in the overall amount of our factoring activity and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe success of our trust services is dependent upon market fluctuations and a non-diversified source for its growth.\nWe offer traditional fiduciary services such as serving as executor, trustee, agent, administrator or custodian for individuals, nonprofit organizations,\nemployee benefit plans and organizations. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had approximately $1.9 billion in trust assets. The level of assets under\nmanagement is significantly impacted by the market value of the assets. To date, virtually all of the growth in our assets under management relates to one\nregistered investment advisor, Cain Watters, who has advised its clients of the existence of our trust services. We have not compensated the registered\ninvestment advisor in any way for making its clients aware of our trust services and cannot assure you that the investment advisor will continue to notify\nits clients of our trust services or that those clients will open trust accounts at the Bank. Related to this, the Bank and Cain Watters are parties to an\nagreement which includes a provision obligating each party to preserve the other’s business relationship with their mutual clients. However, in the event\nthat the Cain Watters’ relationship does not continue (for whatever reason) to refer client to the Bank’s trust department, such a change could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the future growth and, thus, profits and operations of the Company. In addition, we are subject to regulatory supervision with\nrespect to these trust services that may restrain our growth and profitability.\n38\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to possible claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nClients could make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether client claims and legal action\nrelated to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner\nfavorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect our market perception of our products and services as well as\nimpact client demand for those products and services. Although we have not experienced any material claims or litigation pertaining to fiduciary\nresponsibility, the occurrence of any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could suffer material credit losses.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of non-payment, risks resulting from\nuncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and increases in inflation and\ninterest rates. Changes in the economy can cause the assumptions that we made at origination to change and can cause borrowers to be unable to make\npayments on their loans, and significant changes in collateral values can cause us to be unable to collect the full value of loans we make. Increases in\ninterest rates and inflation increase costs and decrease profits, reducing the ability of a borrower to make payments on its loan. There is no assurance that\nour credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit\nadministration personnel and our policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and\nthe quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur levels of nonperforming assets could increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in\nlosses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our nonperforming loans (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest\nand loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that are not performing in accordance with their modified terms) totaled $2.6 million.\nWe had no other real estate owned at December 31, 2023. However, our nonperforming assets may continue to remain at low levels or we may experience\nincreases in nonperforming assets in the future. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest\nincome on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our net interest income, net income and returns on assets and equity,\nand our loan administration costs increase, which together with reduced interest income adversely affects our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in\nforeclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value and estimate disposition costs, which may result in\na loss. These nonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the level of capital our regulators believe is appropriate\nfor us to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be\ndetrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. Further, since many of our loans are located outside of our primary market area, collecting\ndelinquent loans would be more difficult for our staff relative to our competitors. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming\nassets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect\non our net income and related ratios, such as returns on assets and equity.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to absorb actual losses.\nExperience in the banking industry indicates that a portion of our loans in all categories of our lending business will become delinquent, and some\nmay only be partially repaid or may never be repaid at all. Our methodology for establishing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses depends on\nsubjective application of risk grades as indicators of borrowers’ ability to repay. Deterioration in general economic conditions and unforeseen risks\naffecting clients may have an adverse effect on borrowers’ capacity to repay timely their obligations before risk grades could reflect those changing\nccoonnddiittiioonnss.. IInn ttiimmeess ooff iimmpprroovviinngg ccrreeddiitt qquuaalliittyy,, wwiitthh ggrroowwtthh iinn oouurr llooaann ppoorrttffoolliioo,, tthhee aalllloowwaannccee ffoorr ccrreeddiitt lloosssseess mmaayy ddeeccrreeaassee aass aa ppeerrcceenntt ooff ttoottaall llooaannss..\nChanges in economic and market conditions may increase the risk that the allowance would become inadequate if borrowers experience economic and\nother conditions adverse to their businesses. Maintaining the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses may require that we make significant and\nunanticipated increases in our provisions for credit losses, which could materially affect our results of operations and capital adequacy. Recognizing that\nmany of our loans individually represent a significant percentage of our total allowance for credit losses, adverse collection experience in a relatively small\nnumber of loans could require an increase in our allowance.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFederal regulators, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review our allowance for credit losses. The regulatory\nagencies may require us to change classifications or grades on loans, increase the allowance for credit losses with large provisions for credit losses and\nrecognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses required\nby these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur legal lending limits may impair our ability to attract borrowers and ability to compete with larger financial institutions.\nOur per client lending limit at December 31, 2023, was approximately $13.9 million. Accordingly, the size of loans which we can offer to potential\nclients is less than the size which many of our competitors with larger lending limits are able to offer. This limit has affected and will continue to affect our\nability to seek relationships with larger businesses in our market area. We accommodate loans in excess of our lending limit through the sale of portions of\nsuch loans to other banks. However, we may not be successful in attracting or maintaining clients seeking larger loans or in selling portions of such larger\nloans on terms that are favorable to us.\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business conditions, which may impair their\nability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business development and marketing strategies primarily serve the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses.\nThese businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market\nshares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and/or increases in interest rates and inflationary pressure, often need\nsubstantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower’s\nability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small- to medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or\ntwo people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the\nbusiness and its ability to repay its loans. If general economic conditions negatively impact Texas or the specific markets in which we operate and small-\nto medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business conditions, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur commercial finance clients, particularly with respect to the Bank’s Integra factoring division, may lack the operating history, cash flows or\nbalance sheet necessary to support other financing options and may expose us to additional credit risk, especially if our additional controls for such\nproducts are ineffective in mitigating such additional risks.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial finance products. Some of these commercial finance products, particularly asset-\nbased loans and our factored receivables through the Bank’s Integra division, arise out of relationships with clients who lack the operating history, cash\nflows or balance sheet necessary to qualify for other financing options. We attempt to control for the additional credit risk in these relationships through\ncredit management processes employed in connection with these transactions. However, if such controls are ineffective in controlling this additional risk\nor if we fail to follow the procedures we have established for managing this additional risk, we could be exposed to additional losses with respect to such\nproduct lines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our loans are not secured by property but dependent on the earning capacity of the borrower.\nCertain of our loans are not collateralized or fully collateralized by tangible property, but are made on the basis of the cash flow (earnings) being\ngenerated by the borrower. These include, without limitation, certain loans to dentists to either buy out another dentist in a dental practice and/or to buy\ninto a dental practice or to purchase or establish a dental practice. In this case, the borrower may be the dentist and/or the dental practice, neither of\nwhich may have sufficient tangible assets (cash, marketable securities, real estate or other tangible assets) to fully secure or even secure a portion of the\nloan being made. Rather, we look to the earning power and capacity of the dentist and/or dental practice as the primary source of repayment of the loan.\nIn the event that the dentist or dental practice’s earning power is insufficient to service or repay the loan, the additional collateral is usually insufficient to\ncover the outstanding loan balance, in which case we lose substantially all of the loan balance. In the event that these loans default at a high rate, we will\nlikely recover very little from the underlying collateral, in which case the Bank could suffer significant losses and you could lose some or all of your\ninvestment in your Series B preferred stock.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property\ncollateral.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an\nestimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal.\nIn addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the value of\ncollateral backing a loan may be less than supposed, and if a default occurs, we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nFee revenue represents a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline, among other things, in the event of a reduction in,\nor changes to, the level or type of investment activity by our clients and market declines.\nA significant portion of our revenue is the result of fee-based services related to investment advisory, trust services, insurance and brokerage\nactivities. This contrasts with many commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, consolidated non-interest income represented approximately 59.3% of our consolidated gross revenue (which is net interest income\nplus non-interest income). The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our assets under custody and\nadministration and our assets under management, market declines (which reduce asset values), the value and type of securities positions held (with\nrespect to assets under custody) and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients.\nIn addition, our combined clients include private investors, defined benefit and contribution plans, institutional investors, such as mutual funds,\ncollective investment funds, hedge funds and other investment pools, and investment managers. Economic, market or other factors that reduce the level\nor rates of savings in or with those institutions, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could\nmaterially reduce our fee revenue or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. These clients also, by their nature, are often\nable to exert pricing pressure, and this, combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services, has resulted in, and may continue to\nresult in, significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management business lines.\nThe business operations of Sanders Morris may face limitations due to net capital requirements.\nAs a registered broker-dealer, Sanders Morris is subject to the net capital rules administered by the SEC and FINRA. These rules, which specify\nminimum net capital requirements for registered broker-dealers and FINRA members, are designed to assure that broker-dealers maintain adequate net\ncapital in relation to their liabilities and the size of their client’s business. These requirements have the effect of requiring that a substantial portion of a\nbroker-dealer’s assets be kept in cash or highly liquid investments. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to suspension or\nrevocation of its registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and other regulatory bodies. Compliance with these net capital rules\ncould limit operations that require extensive capital, such as underwriting or trading activities.\nThese net capital rules could also restrict our ability to withdraw capital in situations where Sanders Morris has more than the minimum required\ncapital. We may be limited in our ability to pay dividends, implement our strategies, pay interest or repay principal on our debt, and redeem or repurchase\nour outstanding preferred or common stock. In addition, a change in these net capital rules or new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation, or\namount of the net capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or significant charge against net capital, could have similar effects.\nThe wealth management, trust and brokerage business is highly competitive. If we are not able to compete successfully against current and future\ncompetitors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe wealth management, trust and brokerage business is highly competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete directly with many other\nnational and regional full service financial services firms, banks, insurance companies, asset management and advisory firms, and, to a lesser extent, with\non-line and discount brokers. Further, many online brokers have gone to a “no commission” structure, putting additional pressure on our brokerage\noperations. We also compete for wealth management services with commercial banks, private trust companies, sponsors of mutual funds, financial\nplanning firms, venture capital, private equity and hedge funds, and other wealth managers. Moreover, we compete with ETFs that generally track passive\ninvesting strategies and charge lower management fees than active strategies, which may affect both the profitability of asset managers, on whose\nsuccess we in part depend, and the perceived value of our investment services regarding ETFs. A continued lessening of investor interest in actively\nmanaged equity funds could decrease demand for and/or pricing on our investment services.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe are a small firm. Many of our competitors have more personnel and financial resources than we do. Larger competitors are able to advertise their\nproducts and services on a national or regional basis and may have a greater number and variety of products and distribution outlets for their products,\nlarger client bases, and greater name recognition. These larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the wealth\nmanagement and institutional services industries, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth, and to compete for market share generally.\nIncreased competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced revenue and loss of market share. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the\ncompetitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions or acquisitions that also could materially and\nadversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase\ncompetitive pressures on us. The growth of online wealth management tools that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice,\nsometimes called robo-advice, may further accelerate the adoption of passively managed portfolios and reduce demand for and/or pricing on our\ninvestment services. Consequently, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to compete\neffectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nUnderperformance or declines in our investments, in either relative or absolute terms, may reduce the profitability of our wealth management and\nadvisory business.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new wealth management business.\nUnderperformance or market declines in our investments could reduce our revenue and impair our growth in a number of ways:\n● existing clients may withdraw funds from our wealth management business in favor of better performing products;\n● asset-based advisory fees could decline as a result of a decrease in the value of assets under management;\n● our ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish;\n● firms with which we have business relationships may terminate their relationships with us; and\n● our wealth managers and investment advisors may depart, whether to join a competitor or otherwise.\nEven when market conditions are generally favorable, our investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of our asset\nmanagers and the particular investments that they make. To the extent our investment style, security selection or investment results underperform other\ninvestment styles, selections or results, in either relative or absolute terms, the revenue and profitability of our wealth management business will likely be\nreduced and our ability to retain and attract new clients and funds will likely be impaired.\nStandard investment management contracts we have with our clients are terminable without cause and on relatively short notice by our clients,\nwhich makes us vulnerable to short-term declines in the performance of the securities under our management.\nLike most investment advisory and wealth management businesses, the investment advisory contracts we have with our clients are typically\nterminable by the client without cause upon less than 30 days’ notice. As a result, even short-term declines in the performance of the securities we\nmanage, which can result from factors outside our control, such as adverse changes in market or economic condition or the poor performance of some of\nthe investments we have recommended to our clients, could lead some of our clients to move assets under our management to other asset classes such as\nbroad index funds or treasury securities, or to investment advisors which have investment product offerings or investment strategies different than ours.\nTherefore, our operating results are heavily dependent on the financial performance of our investment portfolios and the investment strategies we employ\nin our investment advisory businesses and even short-term declines in the performance of the investment portfolios we manage for our clients, whatever\nthe cause, could result in a decline in assets under management and a corresponding decline in investment management fees, which would adversely\naffect our results of operations.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.\nWe continue to experience pricing pressures on investment advisory fees, as well as trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity\ntrading. In the fixed income market, regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency, leading to price competition and decreased\ntrading margins. In the equity market, we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions, partially due to the industry trend\ntoward unbundling fees related to research and execution and the trend towards “no commission” trading. Our trading margins have been further\ncompressed by the use of electronic and direct market access trading, which has created additional competitive pressure. In addition, we face pricing\npressures in our advisory business, which has seen new entrants compete for clients on the basis of price. We believe that price competition and pricing\npressures in these and other areas will continue as investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay, including by reducing the number of\nadvisory and brokerage firms they use, and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing advisory fees, commissions or margins.\nWe face strong competition from other insurance agencies, which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive and has, historically, been characterized by periods of significant price competition, alternating with\nperiods of greater pricing discipline during which competitors focus on other factors, including service, experience, the strength of agent and\npolicyholder relationships, reputation, speed and accuracy of claims payment, perceived financial strength, ratings, scope of business, commissions paid\nand policy and contract terms and conditions. Our insurance business competes with many other insurers, including large national companies that have\ngreater financial, marketing and management resources than HWG. Many of these competitors also have better ratings and market recognition than our\ninsurance business.\nIn addition, a number of new, proposed or potential industry developments also could increase competition in HWG’s industry. These developments\ninclude changes in practices and other effects caused by the Internet (including direct marketing campaigns by HWG’s competitors in established and\nnew geographic markets), which have led to greater competition in the insurance business and increased expectations for customer service. These\ndevelopments could prevent our insurance business from expanding its book of business.\nOur insurance business also faces competition from new entrants into the insurance market. New entrants do not have historic claims or losses to\naddress and, therefore, may be able to price policies on a basis that is not favorable to our insurance business. New competition could reduce the demand\nfor HWG’s insurance products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\nDue to the scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services\nto a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client, as well as\nsituations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with other businesses within the\nfirm and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship. In addition, our status as a bank\nholding company subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the Federal Reserve with respect to transactions between\nour entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between our subsidiaries (including Sanders Morris\nand Tectonic Advisors) and certain covered funds.\nWe may incur significant losses due to ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposures through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary\nfinancial, credit, operational and compliance systems, and internal control and management review processes. However, those systems and review\nprocesses and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and, as a result, we may not anticipate every economic and financial\noutcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes, particularly in the event of the kinds of dislocations in market\nconditions experienced in recent years, which highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. If those systems and review\nprocesses prove to be ineffective in identifying and managing risks, we could be subjected to increased regulatory scrutiny and regulatory restrictions\ncould be imposed on our business, including on our potential future business lines, as a result of which our business and operating results could be\nadversely affected.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely, in\nwhich case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we could be\nsubject to regulatory penalties and the price of the Series B preferred stock may decline.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting\non that system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As a public company, we are\nrequired to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and other rules that govern public companies, including making\nannual assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, when we cease to be an emerging growth company,\nour independent registered public accounting firm may be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will\ncontinue to periodically test and update, as necessary, our internal control systems, including our financial reporting controls. Our actions, however, may\nnot be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment. In particular, we may not be able to maintain effective internal control over segment\nreporting.\nOur management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to our failure to cure any identified material\nweakness, significant deficiency or otherwise. Moreover, even if our management concludes that its internal control over financial reporting is effective,\nour independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. In addition, during the\ncourse of the evaluation, documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able\nto remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by FDICIA. Any such deficiencies may also subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. If we fail\nto achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from\ntime to time, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have\neffective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the FDICIA, and we may suffer adverse regulatory\nconsequences or violations of listing standards.\nAny future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements which in turn\ncould harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our access to the capital markets,\ncause the price of the Series B preferred stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalties and litigation.\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements and our estimates and assumptions\nmay not be accurate.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make significant estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. The processes the Company uses to estimate its\nprobable credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest\nrates and other market measures on the company’s financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting\nmodels. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if\nthese assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If\nthe models the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses\nupon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Company uses for determining its probable credit losses are inadequate,\nthe allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial\ninstruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could\nrealize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company’s analytical or forecasting models could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.\nGoodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually and more frequently when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized\nbalance of our finite-lived intangible assets when indicators of potential impairment are present. Factors that may indicate that the carrying value of our\ngoodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization and slower growth rates in our\nindustry. We will continue to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. The recognition of a significant charge to earnings\nin our consolidated financial statements resulting from any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could materially adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n44\nTable of Contents\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital, but that capital may not be available, or it may be dilutive.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside our control, and on our\nfinancial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise\nadditional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business.\nThese outcomes could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations through acquisitions and may result in increases in\noperating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition,\nin order to raise additional capital, we may need to issue shares of our preferred or common stock that would reduce our shareholders’ percentage\nownership interest to the extent they do not participate in future offerings. Also, if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take\nalterative actions which may include the sale of income-producing assets to meet our capital requirements, which could have an adverse impact on our\nresults of operations and ability to generate income.\nWe face intense competition from larger banks, financial institutions and financial technology (FinTech) companies that could hurt our business.\nWe conduct our business operations in markets where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by large multi-state and in-state\nbanks with operations and offices covering wide geographic areas. We also compete with other financial service businesses, including investment\nadvisory and wealth management firms, mutual fund companies, financial technology companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms\nthat offer competitive banking and financial products and services as well as products and services that we do not offer. Larger banks and many of those\nother financial service organizations have greater financial, technology and marketing resources than we do that enable them to conduct extensive\nadvertising campaigns, promote ease of use through technology and/or shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. They also\nhave substantially more capital and higher lending limits than we do, which enable them to attract larger clients and offer financial products and services\nthat we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits and investment management clients. In addition,\nwe face increased competition from financial technology firms that offer their solutions online and/or through the use of mobile phone apps and other\ntechnological means, which are increasingly preferred by younger consumers of financial services. If we are unable to compete effectively with those\nbanking or other financial services businesses, we could find it more difficult to attract new and retain existing clients and our net interest margins, net\ninterest income and investment management fees could decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nprospects, and could cause us to incur losses in the future.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological\nimprovements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and\nservices. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients and to reduce costs. Our future\nsuccess will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy\nclient demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many national vendors provide turn-key services that allow\nsmaller banks to compete with institutions that have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. However, these technology\nservices many not be as sophisticated or adoptable as some of our larger competitors and we may be subject to long-term contracts that impede our\nability to change vendors to adapt to a changing technology marketplace. Thus, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven\nproducts and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients.\nWe depend on third party systems, so a systems failure could significantly disrupt our business. These and other operational risks may disrupt our\nbusiness, result in regulatory action against us, or limit our growth.\nOur business depends highly on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets, and\nthe transactions we process have become increasingly complex.\nConsequently, we rely heavily on our communications and financial, accounting, and other data processing systems, including systems provided by\nour clearing brokers and service providers. We face operational risk arising from mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions or from\ntransactions not being properly recorded, evaluated, or accounted.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIf any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to clients,\nregulatory intervention, or reputational damage. Any failure or interruption of our systems, the systems of our clearing brokers or custodians, or third\nparty trading systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results. In addition, our clearing brokers and custodians provide our principal disaster recovery system. We cannot provide assurance that we\nor our clearing brokers or custodians will not suffer any systems failures or interruption, including ones caused by earthquake, fire, other natural\ndisasters, power or telecommunications failure, act of God, act of war, terrorism, or otherwise, or that our or our clearing brokers’ back-up procedures and\ncapabilities in the event of any such failure or interruption will be adequate. The inability of our or our clearing brokers’ or custodians’ systems to\naccommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our business.\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity risks associated with our internet-based systems and online commerce security, and our information systems could\nexperience an interruption, failure, breach in security, or cyber-attack.\nThe Company relies heavily on public utilities infrastructures, internal information and operating systems, and cloud-based solutions and storage to\nconduct its business, and these systems could fail in a variety of ways. In addition, the use of network, cloud-based, or third-party hosted systems\nexpose the Company to the increased sophistication and activity of cyber-criminals, both domestic and international. A cyber incident is considered to be\nany adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information resources of the Company. These incidents may be an\nintentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve blocking the Company from accessing its own systems or remote servers in exchange for a\nransom payment, gaining unauthorized access directly to our information systems, or indirectly through our vendors and customers systems or servers,\nfor purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential corporate information or customers’ Personally Identifiable Information, corrupting data,\ndenying access or causing operational disruption. The Company’s independent third-party service providers or their subcontractors may also have\naccess to customers’ personal information and therefore also expose the Company to cybersecurity risk. Additionally, vendors’ and customers’ home,\nbusiness or mobile information systems and the servers they rely on, are at risk of fraudulent corporate account takeovers which the Company may not\nbe able to detect. There is no guarantee the Company’s counteractions will be successful or that the Company will have the resources or technical\nexpertise to anticipate, detect or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.\nThird party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our\noperations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks,\nunauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our customer information inaccurate. These events may\nobstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security\nlaws, an incident could put our customer confidential information at risk. Although we have not experienced a cyber-incident which has compromised our\ndata or systems, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological\ndifficulties or failures. We monitor and modify, as necessary, our protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of cyber threats.\nThe occurrence of any failures or disruptions of infrastructure, or breakdown, breach, failures or interruptions of the Company’s information\nsystems, access points, or those hosted by third-party service providers and customers, or in the cloud, or the Company’s inability to detect, respond,\ndisclose and correct such occurrence or compromise in a timely manner, could result in an interruption in our ability to conduct transactions for an\nindeterminable length of time, could expose customers’ personal and confidential information to unauthorized parties, increase the risk of fraud or theft,\nsubject the Company to increased operational costs to detect and rectify the situation, damage the Company’s reputation and deter customers from using\nthe Company’s services, and increase the Company insurance cost or the ability to obtain adequate cyber insurance coverage. In addition, as a result of\nany breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection or related to remediation. Furthermore, our customers could\nterminate their accounts with us because of a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party, which is outside\nof our control. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial\nliability.\n46\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to certain operating risks related to employee error and customer, employee and third party misconduct and fraudulent activity, which\ncould harm our reputation and business.\nEmployee error or employee and customer misconduct or fraudulent activity could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and harm\nour reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our\ncustomers or improper use of confidential information, and misconduct or fraud by our customers could include check “kiting” or fraud, wire fraud or\nother dishonest activities. It is not always possible to prevent employee error or misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this\nactivity may not always be effective. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. Our necessary dependence upon processing systems to record and process\ntransactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in\nlosses that are difficult to detect. Employee error or misconduct could also subject us to financial claims. If our internal control systems fail to prevent or\ndetect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured, exceeds applicable insurance limits or if insurance coverage is denied or not available, it could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFactoring products offered by the Bank’s Integra factoring division may expose us to an increased risk of fraud.\nWe rely on the structural features embedded in the factoring products offered by the Bank’s Integra factoring division to mitigate the credit risk\nassociated with such products. With respect to our factoring products, we purchase the underlying invoices of our customers and become the direct\npayee under such invoices, thus transferring the credit risk in such transactions from our customers to the underlying account debtors on such invoices.\nIn the event one or more of our customers fraudulently represents the existence or validity of an invoice we purchase in the case of a factoring\ntransaction, we may advance more funds to such customer than we otherwise would and lose the benefit of the structural protections of our products\nwith respect to such advances. In such event we could be exposed to material additional losses with respect to such factoring products. Although we\nbelieve we have controls in place to monitor and detect fraud with respect to our factoring products, there is no guarantee such controls will be effective.\nLosses from such fraudulent activity could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on client and counterparty information, which subjects us to risks if that information is not accurate or is incomplete.\nWhen deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients or counterparties, we may rely on information provided by or on\nbehalf of those clients and counterparties, including audited financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations\nmade by clients and counterparties that the information they provide is accurate and complete. We conduct appropriate due diligence on such client\ninformation and, where practical and economical, we engage valuation and other experts or sources of information to assist with assessing collateral and\nother client risks. Our financial results could be adversely affected if the financial statements, collateral value or other financial information provided by\nclients or counterparties are incorrect.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business\ncommunity has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state\nregulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive\ninitiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks’ risk\nmanagement practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for\ncredit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to\ncommunities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks\nposed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations;\nhowever, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may\nadversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to\ncover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be\nnegatively impacted by climate change, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may\nnegatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we\noperate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results\nof operations.\n47\nTable of Contents\nA natural disaster could harm our business.\nWe have clients across the United States, but concentrations in California (subject to earthquakes and wildfires), Florida (hurricanes) and Texas\n(hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and flooding). The nature and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted. These natural disasters could harm our\noperations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from\ngathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our\noperational, financial and management information systems. Additionally, natural disasters could negatively impact the values of collateral securing our\nborrowers’ loans and interrupt our borrowers’ abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, either of which could result\nin losses and increased provisions for credit losses for us.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. It is inherently difficult to\nassess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in proceedings or litigation. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted\nagainst us and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual\noutcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance\ncoverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance\ncovering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be\nable to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nThe Company is subject to environmental risks associated with owning real estate or collateral.\nThe cost of cleaning up or paying damages and penalties associated with environmental problems could increase the Company’s operating expenses\nand result in a decline in the underlying collateral. When a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, the Company may purchase the property\nin foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. The Company may also take over the management of commercial properties\nwhose owners have defaulted on loans. The Company also owns and leases premises where banking and other facilities are located. While the\nCompany’s lending, foreclosure and facilities policies and guidelines are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination,\nhazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Company may own, acquire, manage or occupy. Environmental laws could force the\nCompany to clean up the properties at the Company’s expense. It may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth and it may be\ndifficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. The Company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower’s operations if the\nCompany takes a role in managing those operations after a default.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which could constrain our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and\nregulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and\nthe overall financial stability of the banking system in the United States. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital\nrequirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict\nthe ability of institutions to guarantee any debt we may issue and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and\nmay result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance\nwith laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to\ncomply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to\nrestrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price\nof our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. The banking industry remains heavily regulated. Compliance with such regulations may increase\nour costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for additional information regarding the supervisory and regulatory issues facing the Company.\n48\nTable of Contents\nRecent bank failures and the related negative impact on customer confidence in the safety and soundness of the banking industry may adversely\naffect our business, earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to a number of risks when other financial institutions experience financial difficulties, which could result in an adverse\nimpact on the regional banking industry, generally, and the business environment in which the Company operates. Recent bank failures during 2023 have\nresulted in significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and has caused uncertainty in the investor community and bank\ncustomers, generally. While the Company does not believe that the circumstances of the bank failures in 2023 are indicators of broader issues within the\nbanking industry, bank failures may negatively impact customer confidence in the safety and soundness of regional banks and, as a result, customers\nmay choose to maintain deposits with larger financial institutions or invest in higher yielding short-term fixed income securities, all of which could\nmaterially adversely impact our liquidity, cost of funding, loan funding capacity, net interest margin, capital and results of operations.\nMoreover, the FDIC’s sale of one of the institutions resulted in $20 billion in projected losses to the DIF. More losses may result from this institution\nor others. The resultant losses to the DIF will likely result in higher premiums for depository insurance and increased regulatory scrutiny, which will result\nin higher compliance costs and likely greater regulation. Each of these results will reduce the profitability and increase the regulatory costs of the\nCompany. Management continues to monitor the ongoing events concerning the 2023 bank failures as well as any volatility within the financial services\nindustry generally, together with any responsive measures taken by the banking regulators to mitigate or manage potential turmoil in the financial\nservices industry.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth.\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements on a consolidated basis, and at both the Bank and Sanders Morris separately. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could\nhave a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the\nBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet commitments as\ncalculated under these regulations. The failure to meet the established capital requirements under the prompt corrective action framework could result in\none or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new\nactivities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our\nability to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating the Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance. FDIC deposit insurance is critical\nto the continued operation of the Bank. In addition, an inability to meet the capital requirements under the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, would\nprevent us from being able to pay certain discretionary bonuses to our executive officers and dividends to our shareholders.\nMany factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital\nratios. For example, changes in risk weightings of assets relative to capital and other factors may combine to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets\nin the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio. Any increases in our risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase\nin our capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized credit losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments and\nother factors will decrease our capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios.\nOur failure to remain well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes, either under the Basel III regime or the community bank leverage ratio framework,\ncould affect client and investor confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds, our ability to pay competitive rates to attract and retain deposits, FDIC\ninsurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on preferred and common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. In addition, if we cease to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that we pay on deposits and\nour ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted.\n49\nTable of Contents\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our banking business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our\nfailure to comply with any supervisory actions which we are, or may become, subject to as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. As a result of an examination, regulatory agencies may determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset\nconcentrations, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, or other aspects of any of our operations are unsatisfactory, or that\nwe or our management are in violation of any law, regulation or guideline in effect from time to time. Regulatory agencies may take a number of different\nremedial actions, including the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any\nviolation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change\nthe composition of our concentrations in portfolio or balance sheet assets, to assess civil monetary penalties against officers or directors, to remove\nofficers and directors and, if such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, the FDIC may terminate our deposit\ninsurance. A regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws\ncould lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending\nrequirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, the CFPB, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and\nregulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide\nvariety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on\nexpansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair\nlending laws in private class action litigation. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the BSA and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and as further amended by the National Defense Authorization Act, and other laws and\nregulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious\nactivity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer the BSA, is authorized\nto impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the\nindividual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service (the\n“IRS”). There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed\ndeficient or the policies, procedures and systems of any financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deemed deficient, we could be subject\nto liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to\nproceed with certain aspects of our business plan, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although\nwe have not been subject to fines or other penalties, or suffered business or reputational harm, as a result of money laundering activities, failure to\nmaintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for\nus. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAdditional regulations and rule making impacting the transportation industry may have a disproportionate impact on the small-to-mid-sized\ntrucking businesses that comprise our primary transportation factoring clients and adversely affect the factoring business conducted by the Bank’s\nIntegra factoring division.\nOur primary transportation factoring clients are small-sized owner-operators and trucking fleets. Recently implemented federal regulations, and\nregulations proposed to be implemented in the future, may significantly increase the costs and expenses or reduce the ability to generate revenue\nassociated with owning or operating a trucking fleet. These regulations include rule making proposed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\nof the United States Department of Transportation (“FMCSA”) under the Compliance, Safety, Accountability (“CSA”) initiative, maximum hours of\nservice limitations imposed by the FMCSA, electronic log requirements, and regulations proposed by the federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)\nrequiring increased labeling and monitoring by carriers of any commodity transported that is regulated by the FDA. The costs and burdens of compliance\nwith these requirements will have a disproportionate impact on the small-to-mid-sized trucking businesses that comprise our client base and may force\nsome or all of these businesses out of the market. Such an occurrence could impact the returns we realize on the factoring activity conducted by the\nBank’s Integra factoring division or result in a decrease in the overall amount of factoring activity conducted by the Bank’s Integra factoring division and\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to substantial regulation. If we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our business will be\nadversely affected.\nTectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. Sanders Morris is registered as a\nbroker-dealer with the SEC and FINRA; Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris are registered with the SEC as investment advisors. The SEC is the federal\nagency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws. In addition, SROs, principally FINRA and the securities exchanges, are actively\ninvolved in the regulation of broker-dealers. Tectonic Advisors and Sanders Morris are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in\nthose states in which we do business. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of clients and the securities\nmarkets rather than protection of creditors and shareholders of broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the\nsecurities business, including sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure\nof securities firms, record-keeping, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.\nAs investment advisors, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations\non registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. Moreover, the Advisers Act grants broad\nadministrative powers to regulatory agencies such as the SEC to regulate investment advisory businesses. Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are\nalso subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA to the extent that they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients.\nERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain\ntransactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties)\nto such plans. Additionally, like other investment advisory and broker-dealer companies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors face the risks of lawsuits\nby clients. The outcome of regulatory proceedings and lawsuits is uncertain and difficult to predict. An adverse resolution of any regulatory proceeding\nor lawsuit could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to Sanders Morris or Tectonic Advisors and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on\nthe ability to retain key relationship and wealth managers, and to retain existing clients or attract new clients, any of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSanders Morris is subject to periodic examinations by the SEC and FINRA and Tectonic Advisors by the SEC. In these examinations, personnel from\nFINRA or the SEC (as applicable) make a visit to the office(s) of Sanders Morris or Tectonic Advisors and review the files, business practices and\npersonnel. These reviews are often based on a pre-examination checklist or areas of interest, often based on the risks associated with Sanders Morris’ or\nTectonic Advisors’ business. The examiners consult with their home office and, at the end of the examination, often issue a letter setting forth areas\nrequiring attention. However, under certain circumstances, a poor examination or a violation brought to the SEC’s or FINRA’s attention can result in an\nadministrative proceeding.\n51\nTable of Contents\nThe SEC, FINRA, and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in:\n● censure, fines, or civil penalties;\n● issuance of cease-and-desist orders;\n● deregistration, suspension, or expulsion of a broker-dealer or investment advisor;\n● suspension or disqualification of the broker-dealer’s officers or employees;\n● prohibition against engaging in certain lines of business; and\n● other adverse consequences.\nIn the last five years, neither Tectonic Advisors nor Sanders Morris has received what either believes is a poor examination by any of their federal or\nstate regulators, been subject to any material administrative proceeding or been found to be in material violation by their federal or state regulators or\nexperienced an imposition of any material penalties, censure, fines or cease-and-desist orders by such regulators. The imposition of any penalties or\norders on us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The investment banking and brokerage\nindustries have recently come under scrutiny at both the state and federal levels, and the cost of compliance and the potential liability for noncompliance\nhas increased as a result.\nOur ability to comply with laws and regulations relating to our financial services businesses depends in large part upon maintaining a system to\nmonitor compliance and our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. Although we believe we are in material compliance with all\napplicable laws and regulations, we may not be able to comply in the future. Any noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal\ninformation and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and\nwe could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the GLBA, which, among other things: (i) imposes certain\nlimitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our clients with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain\ndisclosures to clients about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clients the right to “opt out” of any information sharing\nby us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information\nsecurity program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of client\ninformation we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states and foreign\ncountries have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement\nnotification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States and other countries are\nincreasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current\nand planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or\nemployee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations\nand could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal\nTrade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification)\naffecting client or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide\ncertain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to\ncomply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or\nactions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe can be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to conduct risk.\nU.S. authorities have been increasingly focused on “conduct risk,” a term that is used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees\nand agents, including third-party vendors, that could harm clients, consumers, investors or the markets, such as failures to safeguard consumers’ and\ninvestors’ personal information, failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest and improperly creating, selling and marketing products and services.\nIn addition to increasing compliance risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings and litigation,\nincluding for practices which historically were acceptable but are now receiving greater scrutiny. Further, while we take numerous steps to prevent and\ndetect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients, investors or the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or\nprevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms. In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural\nchanges that could result from perceived deficiencies in our culture, such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings. Although we have\nnot been subject to any material conduct risk investigations or inquiries in the past eight years, the occurrence of such proceedings, investigations or\ninquiries could damage our reputation, disrupt our business, increase our costs and causes losses in the future.\nRisks Related to an Investment in the Series B Preferred Stock\nThe Series B preferred stock is an equity security and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness, which could adversely impact our\nability to pay dividends on the Series B preferred stock.\nThe shares of Series B preferred stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness of ours. This means that the Series B preferred stock\nranks junior to all our existing and future indebtedness and our other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us,\nincluding claims in the event of our liquidation.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our total liabilities were approximately $570.5 million, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to increase our\ncapital resources or fund strategic acquisitions or other business efforts. Additionally, if our capital ratios or the capital ratios of the Bank fall below\nminimum ratios required by the Federal Reserve, we or the Bank could be required to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt\nsecurities, including senior or subordinated notes, or other applicable securities that could rank senior to the Series B preferred stock. The Series B\npreferred stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to\nthe limited voting rights referred to below. In addition, dividends on the Series B preferred stock are payable only when, as, and if declared by our board\nof directors out of assets legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to\npay obligations on the Series B preferred stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. Accordingly, our existing and future\nindebtedness may restrict the payment of dividends on the Series B preferred stock. Further, if we are unable to or do not pay dividends on the Series B\npreferred stock, the market price of the Series B preferred stock may decline.\nThe Series B preferred stock may be junior in rights and preferences to our future preferred stock.\nThe Series B preferred stock may rank junior to preferred stock issued in the future that by its terms is expressly senior in rights and preferences to\nthe Series B preferred stock, although the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 662∕3% of all outstanding shares of the Series B preferred\nstock is required to authorize or issue any shares of stock senior in rights and preferences to the Series B preferred stock. The terms of any future\npreferred stock expressly senior to the Series B preferred stock may restrict dividend payments on the Series B preferred stock.\nAdditional issuances of preferred stock or securities convertible into preferred stock may further dilute existing holders of the Series B preferred\nstock.\nWe may determine that it is advisable, or we may encounter circumstances where we determine it is necessary, to issue additional shares of preferred\nstock, securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent an interest in preferred stock, or preferred stock-equivalent securities to fund\nstrategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital. Our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue one or more classes or\nseries of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the shareholders, including issuing additional shares of Series B preferred\nstock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may\nbe issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the Series B preferred stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution,\nwinding-up and liquidation and other terms.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAlthough the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 662∕3% of all outstanding shares of the Series B preferred stock is required to\nauthorize or issue any shares of capital stock senior in rights and preferences to the Series B preferred stock, if we issue preferred stock in the future with\nvoting rights that dilute the voting power of the Series B preferred stock, the rights of holders of the Series B preferred stock or the market price of the\nSeries B preferred stock could be adversely affected. The market price of the Series B preferred stock could decline as a result of these other offerings, as\nwell as other sales of a large block of Series B preferred stock or similar securities in the market thereafter, or the perception that such sales could occur.\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nPayment of dividends by the Company on its common stock, corporate spin-offs or other corporate actions may diminish the amount of capital\nand/or earning power of the Company to pay dividends on, or redeem, its Series B preferred stock.\nSubject to regulatory requirements and the terms of the Series B preferred stock, the Company may: (a) and currently intends to, pay dividends on its\ncommon stock and any such payment reduces the capital of the Company available to the Series B preferred stock and (b) undertake certain corporate\nactions, including, without limitation, spinning off subsidiaries and/or businesses to its stockholders, selling businesses to third parties, (c) making\nacquisitions using capital from the Company and (d) borrowing and/or investing its capital to make acquisitions and/or for other purposes (hiring key\npersonnel, etc.). In each of these cases, the holders of the Series B preferred stock may not have the ability to block certain of such actions and, in such\ncase, the capital base and/or earnings of the Company may be negatively impacted. In such case, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on and/or\nredeem the Series B preferred stock may be negatively impacted.\nDividends on the Series B preferred stock are discretionary and non-cumulative, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nAlthough we intend to continue to pay dividends on the Series B preferred stock, dividends on the Series B preferred stock are discretionary and are\nnot mandatory or cumulative. If our board of directors does not declare a dividend on the Series B preferred stock or if our board of directors authorizes\nand we declare less than a full dividend in respect of a Dividend Period, the holders of the Series B preferred stock will have no right to receive any\ndividend or a full dividend, as the case may be, for the Dividend Period, and we will have no obligation to pay a partial or full dividends for that Dividend\nPeriod at any time, whether or not our board of directors declares a dividend on the Series B preferred stock or any other class or series of our capital\nstock for any future Dividend Period. Any declaration and payment of dividends on the Series B preferred stock depends upon, among other factors, our\nearnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt\nobligations senior to the Series B preferred stock, dividend restrictions contained in any credit agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our\nboard of directors.\nThe Bank and Sanders Morris are subject to capital ratios. In addition, the Company is subject to consolidated capital ratios, which take into account\nits underlying subsidiaries’ capital position and the capital position of the Company. To the extent that Sanders Morris and/or the Bank suffer losses\n(including, without limitation, credit losses at the Bank), they may fail to meet their minimum capital requirements necessary for them to pay dividends to\nthe Company, which would impact the Company’s ability to pay dividends on the preferred stock. In addition, to the extent that the Company and/or its\nunderlying subsidiaries (including the Bank) suffer losses that cause the Company to be less than “well capitalized”, then the Company, even if it has\ncash available to it, would not be permitted to pay dividends on the preferred stock without regulatory approval, which may not be granted. Accordingly,\nany losses suffered by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, particularly credit losses at the Bank, might have a material adverse effect on the Company,\nincluding on the ability of the Company to pay dividends on the preferred stock.\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization’s overall\nasset quality, current and prospective earnings and level, composition and quality of capital. The guidance provides that we inform and consult with the\nFederal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in\nan adverse change to our capital structure, including interest on any debt obligations.\nIn addition, the Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid\nby or distributions made from its subsidiaries. These dividends and distributions are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our preferred\nstock and common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends or\ndistributions that our bank and nonbank subsidiaries may pay to the Company. In the event our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make\ndistributions to the Company, the Company may not be able to service debt or pay dividends on the Series B preferred stock. The inability to receive\ndividends and distributions from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and liquidity.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe replacement of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) on our Series B preferred stock could increase our interest payments, may\nadversely affect the value of the Series B preferred stock and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financing Conduct Authority and the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, the administrator\nfor LIBOR, concurrently announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and\nthe most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which identified SOFR as its preferred alternative\nto LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. With the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the preferred alternative to LIBOR, we have transitioned\nand amended our contracts and financial instruments, including the Series B preferred stock, to reference the SOFR rate where required.\nSOFR has a very limited history, and its historical performance is not indicative of future performance. The Federal Reserve began to publish SOFR\nin April 2018; therefore, SOFR has limited performance history and no actual investment based on the performance of SOFR was possible before April\n2018. The level of SOFR during the floating rate period for our Series B preferred stock may bear little or no relation to the historical level of SOFR.\nFurthermore, the future performance of SOFR is impossible to predict and, as a result, no future performance of SOFR or our Series B preferred stock may\nbe inferred from any historical performance data. Changes in the levels of SOFR may affect the return on, and trading price of, our Series B preferred\nstock, but it is impossible to predict whether such levels will rise or fall. Since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion,\nbeen more volatile than daily changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as U.S. dollar LIBOR, during corresponding periods.\nThe composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of U.S. dollar LIBOR and any failure of SOFR to gain market acceptance\ncould adversely affect the Series B preferred stock. SOFR was developed for use in certain U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts as an\nalternative to the U.S. dollar LIBOR in part because it is considered representative of general funding conditions in the overnight Treasury repo market.\nHowever, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does not measure bank-specific credit risk and, as a result, is less likely to\ncorrelate with the unsecured short-term funding costs of banks. In addition, SOFR is an overnight rate, while U.S. dollar LIBOR represents interbank\nfunding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as U.S. dollar LIBOR would have at any\ntime, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic,\nfinancial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. The differences between SOFR and U.S. dollar LIBOR may mean that market participants would not\nconsider SOFR a suitable substitute or successor for all of the purposes for which U.S. dollar LIBOR historically has been used, which may, in turn, lessen\nmarket acceptance of SOFR. If SOFR does not prove to be widely used in securities that are similar or comparable to the Series B preferred stock, the\ntrading price of those securities may be adversely affected.\nDividends on the Series B preferred stock will vary beginning on May 15, 2024 and any dividends declared may be less than the initial fixed annual\nrate in effect prior to May 15, 2024.\nAs described in further detail in the description of the Series B preferred stock attached to this Form 10-K, the annual dividend rate on the Series B\npreferred stock commencing on May 15, 2024 will equal three-month CME Term SOFR, plus a spread of 672 basis points per annum. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, in the event that three-month CME Term SOFR is less than zero, three-month CME Term SOFR shall be deemed to be zero. Therefore, any\ndividends declared on or after May 15, 2024 may vary from period to period and could be more or less than the fixed rate for the initial period. We have no\ncontrol over a number of factors that may affect market interest rates, including geopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory,\njudicial or other events that affect the markets generally and that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of market rate risk.\nThe Series B preferred stock may be redeemed at our option, and you may not be able to reinvest the redemption price you receive in a similar\nsecurity.\nSubject to the approval of the Federal Reserve (if then required), at our option, we may redeem the Series B preferred stock at any time, either in\nwhole or in part, for cash, on any dividend payment date on or after May 15, 2024. We may also redeem the Series B preferred stock at our option, subject\nto the approval of the Federal Reserve (if then required), at any time, in whole, but not in part, within 90 days following the occurrence of a Regulatory\nCapital Treatment Event (as defined in the description of the Series B preferred stock attached to this Form 10-K), such as a proposed change in law or\nregulation with respect to whether the Series B preferred stock qualifies as an “additional Tier 1 capital” instrument.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAlthough the terms of the Series B preferred stock were established at issuance to satisfy the criteria for “additional Tier 1 capital” instruments\nconsistent with Basel III as set forth in the joint final rulemaking issued in July 2013 by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC, it is possible that the\nSeries B preferred stock may not satisfy the criteria set forth in future rulemakings or interpretations. As a result, a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event\ncould occur whereby we would have the right, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve (if then required), to redeem the Series B preferred stock in\naccordance with its terms prior to May 15, 2024, or any date thereafter.\nIf we redeem the Series B preferred stock for any reason, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds you receive in a similar security or\nearn similar rate of return on any investment. See the description of the Series B preferred stock attached to this Form 10-K for more information on\nredemption of the Series B preferred stock.\nInvestors should not expect us to redeem the Series B preferred stock on the date it becomes redeemable or on any particular date after it becomes\nredeemable.\nThe Series B preferred stock is a perpetual equity security. This means that it has no maturity or mandatory redemption date and is not redeemable at\nthe option of the holders of the Series B preferred stock. The Series B preferred stock may be redeemed by us at our option, either in whole or in part, for\ncash, on any dividend payment date on or after May 15, 2024, or in whole, but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital\nTreatment Event. Any decision we may make at any time to propose a redemption of the Series B preferred stock will depend upon, among other things,\nour evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our shareholders’ equity and general market conditions at that time.\nIn addition, our right to redeem the Series B preferred stock is subject to limitations. Under the Federal Reserve’s current risk-based capital guidelines\napplicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Series B preferred stock is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. We cannot\nassure you that the Federal Reserve will approve any redemption of the Series B preferred stock that we may propose. There also can be no assurance\nthat, if we propose to redeem the Series B preferred stock without replacing such capital with common equity Tier 1 capital or additional Tier 1 capital\ninstruments, the Federal Reserve will authorize such redemption. We understand that the factors that the Federal Reserve will consider in evaluating a\nproposed redemption, or a request that we be permitted to redeem the Series B preferred stock without replacing it with common equity Tier 1 capital or\nadditional Tier 1 capital instruments, include its evaluation of the overall level and quality of our capital components, considered in light of our risk\nexposures, earnings and growth strategy, and other supervisory considerations, although the Federal Reserve may change these factors at any time.\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock have limited voting rights.\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of our common shareholders.\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock have voting rights only with respect to (i) authorizing, creating or issuing any capital stock ranking senior to the\nSeries B preferred stock as to dividends and rights (including redemption payments) upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassifying any\nauthorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock or issuing any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to\npurchase any such shares of capital stock, (ii) amending, altering or repealing any provision of our certificate of formation or the designation, including\nby merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the rights, powers or preferences of the Series B preferred stock, (iii) the election of two\ndirectors, if dividends have not been declared or paid in an aggregate amount equal to the equivalent of at least six or more quarterly Dividend Periods,\nwhether or not consecutive, (voting as a class with holders of shares of any other series of preferred stock ranking equally as to the payment of\ndividends and having equivalent voting rights), and (iv) as otherwise required by applicable law. See the description of the Series B preferred stock\nattached to this Form 10-K for more information.\nAn active, liquid market for the Series B preferred stock may not be sustained, which may impair your ability to sell your shares.\nThe Series B preferred stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Market, but an active, liquid trading market for the Series B preferred stock\nmay not exist or, if it exists, may not be sustained over time. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness\ndepends upon the presence in the marketplace and independent decisions of willing buyers and sellers of the Series B preferred stock, over which we\nhave no control. Without an active, liquid trading market for the Series B preferred stock, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume,\nprices and times desired. Moreover, the lack of an established market could materially and adversely affect the value of the Series B preferred stock. The\nmarket price of the Series B preferred stock could decline significantly due to failure to pay dividends, actual or anticipated issuances or sales of the\nSeries B preferred stock or other securities in the future.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of the Series B preferred stock may become subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your\nshares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of the Series B preferred stock may become highly volatile. There are many factors that may affect the market price and trading\nvolume of the Series B preferred stock, including, without limitation:\n●actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n●changes in economic or business conditions;\n●the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n●recommendations by securities analysts;\n●operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n●additional or anticipated sales of the Series B preferred stock or other securities by us or our existing shareholders;\n●additions or departures of key personnel;\n●perceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors or us;\n●significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or\nus;\n●other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and\n●other news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our primary markets or the financial services\nindustry.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in\nmany cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading\nvolume in the Series B preferred stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the\nmarket price of the Series B preferred stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nSecurities analysts may not continue coverage on us, or may publish an unfavorable report.\nThe trading market for the Series B preferred stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our\nbusiness. We do not have any control over these securities analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports\non us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of the Series B preferred stock to decline. If we are\nthe subject of an unfavorable report, the price of the Series B preferred stock may decline.\nThe Series B preferred stock is not rated.\nThe Series B preferred stock is not rated by any rating agency. Unrated securities usually trade at a discount to similar, rated securities. As a result,\nthere is a risk that the Series B preferred stock may trade at a price that is lower than they might otherwise trade if rated by a rating agency. It is possible,\nhowever, that one or more rating agencies might independently determine to assign a rating to the Series B preferred stock. In addition, we may elect to\nissue other securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating. If any ratings are assigned to the Series B preferred stock in the future or if we issue other\nsecurities with a rating, such ratings, if they are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or withdrawn, could adversely affect the\nmarket for or the market value of the Series B preferred stock.\n57\nTable of Contents\nOur management and board of directors have significant control over our business.\nAs of March 27, 2024, our directors, executive officers and affiliates (including partners of Cain Watters) beneficially owned an aggregate of 5,099,935\nshares, or approximately 71.17% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Consequently, our management and board of directors may be able to\nsignificantly affect our affairs and policies, including the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a\nvote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. This influence may also\nhave the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve\ntransactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our Company. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interests of our other\nshareholders, including you.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of NASDAQ, and as such, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate\ngovernance requirements. As a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such\nrequirements.\nWe are a “controlled company” under NASDAQ’s corporate governance listing standards, meaning that more than 50% of the voting power for the\nelection of our board of directors is held by a single person, entity or group. As a controlled company, we are exempt from the obligation to comply with\ncertain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n●that a majority of our board of directors consists of “independent directors,” as defined under NASDAQ rules;\n●that director nominations are selected, or recommended for the board of directors’ selection, by either (i) the independent directors constituting a\nmajority of the board of directors’ independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate, or (ii) a nominating and corporate\ngovernance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n●that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. We intend to avail ourselves of certain of these other\nexemptions for as long as we remain a “controlled company.” Accordingly, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to\nshareholders of companies that are subject to all of NASDAQ’s corporate governance requirements, which could make our stock less attractive to\ninvestors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nWe are controlled by the majority shareholders, whose interests may not coincide with yours and with whose decisions you may disagree.\nA. Haag Sherman, George L. Ball, Darrell W. Cain, Steven B. Clapp, Thomas Sanders, Daniel C. Wicker, other members of management and partners of\nCain Watters, and certain other existing shareholders (collectively, the “Majority Shareholders”) currently own more than 50% of our outstanding shares\nof common stock. So long as the Majority Shareholders continue to control more than 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, they will have the\nability, if they vote in the same manner, to determine the outcome of certain matters requiring only common shareholder approval, including the election of\ndirectors and certain amendments to our certificate of formation, bylaws and other corporate governance documents. In addition, this concentration of\nownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the\nMajority Shareholders. In any of these matters, the interests of the Majority Shareholders may differ from or conflict with our interests as a company or\nthe interests of other shareholders. Accordingly, the Majority Shareholders could influence us to enter into transactions or agreements that other\nshareholders would not approve or make decisions with which other shareholders may disagree.\nOur corporate organizational documents and provisions of federal and state law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have\nan anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition that you may favor or an attempted replacement of\nour board of directors or management.\nOur certificate of formation and our bylaws (each as amended and restated) may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent\nan attempted acquisition or change of control or a replacement of our incumbent board of directors or management. Our governing documents include\nprovisions that:\n●subject to the rights of the holders of the Series B preferred stock, empower our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue our\npreferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are to be set by our board of directors;\n●eliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors;\n●subject to certain exceptions, permit our board of directors to alter, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or to adopt new bylaws;\n58\nTable of Contents\n●require shareholders that wish to bring business before annual or special meetings of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as\ndirectors at our annual meeting of shareholders, to provide timely notice of their intent in writing; and\n●enable our board of directors to increase, between annual meetings, the number of persons serving as directors and to fill the vacancies created as a\nresult of the increase by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of directors at which there is a quorum.\nBanking laws also impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or\nindirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the CIBCA. These laws could\ndelay or prevent an acquisition.\nFurthermore, our bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located in Dallas County, Texas, the county in which the city of Dallas is located, will\nbe the exclusive forum for: (i) any actual or purported derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of\nfiduciary duty by any of our current or former directors or officers; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or our current or former directors or officers\narising pursuant to the TBOC, our certificate of formation, or our bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or our current or former officers or\ndirectors that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties\nnamed as defendants therein. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice\nof and to have consented to this provision of our certificate of formation. The exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim\nin a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which increase our costs of\noperations and may divert focus from our business operations.\nWe incur substantial legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses related to operating as a public company, and these costs may\nbe higher when we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). We are\nsubject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business\nand financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the\nDodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and NASDAQ, each of which imposes additional reporting and other\nobligations on public companies. As a public company, compliance with these reporting requirements and other SEC and NASDAQ rules make certain\noperating activities more time-consuming, and we also incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. Additionally, any failure by us to\nfile our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner could, among other things, harm our reputation, cause our investors and potential investors to\nlose confidence in us, restrict trading in or reduce the market price of the Series B preferred stock, and potentially limit our ability to access the capital\nmarkets. Furthermore, the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our operating\nstrategy, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our strategic initiatives and improving our results of operations. We incur expenses to\nmaintain our internal control and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. We\ncannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in the future in order to continue to comply with these requirements, and these\ncosts may materially increase our general and administrative expenses over time, and such increases would reduce our profitability.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make the Series B\npreferred stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take\nadvantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without\nlimitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting\nrequirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the\nrequirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved. The JOBS Act also permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to\ncomply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to, and expect to continue to, take advantage of\ncertain of these and other exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Further, the JOBS Act allows us to present only two years of\naudited financial statements and only two years of related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this\nForm 10-K.\n59\nTable of Contents\nWe may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years from the date of our initial offering date in May 2019, unless we earlier cease to be an\nemerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nin a three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer,” in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following\nDecember 31. We cannot predict if investors find the Series B preferred stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions, or if we choose to rely\non additional exemptions in the future. If some investors find the Series B preferred stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading\nmarket for the Series B preferred stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nAn investment in the Series B preferred stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nThe Series B preferred stock is not a savings account, deposit or other obligation of any of our bank or nonbank subsidiaries and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Your investment is subject to investment risk, and you must be capable of affording the loss of\nyour entire investment.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity Risk Management\nCybersecurity is critical to supporting our business and protecting our customers in an increasingly complex environment. We face a variety of\ncybersecurity threats including attacks that are common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, as well as attacks from advanced\nand highly organized adversaries targeting financial services companies. Our information systems have from time to time experienced such attacks despite\nour best efforts to prevent them. Our customers, suppliers, and other third parties also face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident\nimpacting any party could have a material impact on our operations, performance, or operating results. None of these threats or incidents have to date\nmaterially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we cannot assure that any future security breaches will\nnot occur or that any such events that have occurred or may occur in the future will not result in material harm to our business, operations, reputation or\nprofitability. These threats and related risks highlight the importance of allocating resources to protect the Company and our customers. For more\ninformation on how cybersecurity risk may materially affect the Company’s business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, please refer to\nItem 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company maintains a formal Information Security Program that includes risk assessments regularly conducted by internal resources as well as\nthird-party experts. These assessments are used to evaluate potential security threats that may have a negative impact on the organization, detect\npotential vulnerabilities and mitigate any identified security risks. Our program leverages industry standards and frameworks and is designed to protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information assets and systems.\nThe Information Security Program is led by the Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), who reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The CISO has\noversight of the Company’s risk management framework, which includes the Information Security Program. The CISO provides program oversight and\ndirection, including adjustments in response to changes in technology, threats, business processes, and regulatory or statutory requirements. The CISO\nworks collaboratively with information technology staff, operational management, counterparts at third-party vendors and functional stakeholders to\nimplement a program designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats and promptly respond to potential cybersecurity incidents.\nThe CISO has over 20 years of experience in the fields of information technology and cybersecurity and maintains multiple professional cybersecurity\ncertifications.\nOur Information Security Program consists of several elements including:\n● Incident Monitoring and Response. We have 24x7 security cybersecurity monitoring, which utilizes both third-party cybersecurity experts and\nleading tools to monitor activity in our information systems. We also maintain an incident response plan and playbooks that define our response\nto a cybersecurity incident, including a cross-functional incident response process that includes key stakeholders such as senior leaders and\nlegal, and leverages our technological resources and third-party service providers. Through ongoing communication with these teams, the CISO\nmonitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents in real time, and reports such incidents to leadership\nwhen appropriate pursuant to internal guidelines governing the reporting of such events.\n60\nTable of Contents\n● Threat and Vulnerability Management. We maintain a threat and vulnerability management program that leverages multiple data sources to\nproactively identify, assess, and mitigate changing cybersecurity risks. This program incorporates vulnerability scanning and threat intelligence\ncapabilities, which are in place to help safeguard information assets. We also share and receive threat intelligence with government agencies, the\nFinancial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (\"FS-ISAC\") and cybersecurity vendors and leaders in the cybersecurity industry.\n● Infrastructure and Data Protection. We have technical and organizational safeguards that are designed to protect our networks, systems, and\ndata from cybersecurity threats, including: firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, network and endpoint anti-malware protections,\nand access controls such as privileged access management. Our information security and information technology teams collaborate regularly to\nassess the security of current and future infrastructure changes.\n● Third-Party Risk Management. We run a third-party risk management program designed to identify and manage risks, including cybersecurity\nrisks, involving our third-party providers. This includes performing due diligence and assessment of each provider’s cybersecurity posture as\nwell as periodic re-assessments.\n● Security Training and Awareness. We provide ongoing education and training to employees regarding cybersecurity threats and the role they\nplay in helping prevent and detect these threats. This includes regular phishing simulations, with training provided for any failures, as well as\nperiodic communications via the internal company portal concerning threats, best practices, and technology changes to improve security. We\nalso work with the Company marketing department to periodically publish articles on our website to raise security awareness with our customers.\nWhile we maintain teams that specialize in cybersecurity and information technology, we also leverage third-party experts to provide objective\nfeedback on our program and posture. These are accomplished via penetration tests, security posture assessments, and technology consulting. These\nindependent evaluations help validate existing controls, identify potential focus areas, and aid in securely deploying technology in an increasingly\ncomplex environment.\nOur Information Security Program is evaluated regularly by both the internal audit function as well as third-party audit firms. These audits help\nensure our program is appropriate to address the changing threat landscape and aligns to industry standards such as the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology Cybersecurity Framework, as well as other legal and regulatory guidance including the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\nCybersecurity Assessment Tool, the Bankers Electronic Crimes Taskforce Ransomware Self-Assessment Tool, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Controls\nare reviewed for adequacy and design at least annually, and both internal and third-party audits aid in identifying areas for continued focus, providing\nassurance that controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively. Additionally, we meet regularly with examiners from the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency to review our cybersecurity program and discuss the changing threat landscape.\nOur cybersecurity personnel maintain current knowledge through training, obtaining professional certifications, and participation in industry groups\nsuch as FS-ISAC, American Bankers Association, and the Texas Bankers Association. Company cybersecurity personnel expand and test their\nknowledge of cyber threats and countermeasures through additional on-the-job training and periodic simulated exercises to practice their response to\nreal-life threats. We maintain a training budget, and personnel are encouraged to obtain formal training and industry-approved certifications as\nappropriate for their roles and responsibilities.\nThe Technology Committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our information security and technology programs, including\nmanagement’s actions to identify, assess, mitigate, and remediate or prevent material cybersecurity issues and risks. Our Chief Information Security\nOfficer provides quarterly reports to the Technology Committee of our board of directors regarding the information security program and the technology\nprogram, key enterprise cybersecurity initiatives, and other matters relating to cybersecurity processes. The Technology Committee of our board of\ndirectors reviews and approves our information security and technology budgets and strategies at least annually. Additionally, the Technology\nCommittee of our board of directors reviews our cyber security risk profile on at least an annual basis.\n61\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Legal Proceedings.\nWe are involved, from time to time, as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of its business. Based on the\ninformation presently available, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse\neffect on the business’s financial condition or results of operations of the Company on a consolidated basis. However, changes in circumstances or\nadditional information could result in additional accruals or resolution of these matters in excess of established accruals, which could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows, potentially materially.\nItem 4.

If\nour board of directors does not declare a dividend on the Series B preferred stock or if our board of directors authorizes and we declare less than a full\ndividend in respect of any dividend period, the holders of the Series B preferred stock will have no right to receive any dividend or a full dividend and we\nwill have no obligation to pay a dividend or to pay full dividends for that dividend period at any time, whether or not dividends on the Series B preferred\nstock or any other class or series of our preferred stock or common stock are declared for any future dividend period.\nIt is the policy of our board of directors to reinvest earnings for such period of time as is necessary to ensure our successful operations. During the\nyear ended 2023, and after declaring and paying dividends on our Series B preferred stock, our board of directors declared and paid certain quarterly\ndividends on our common stock, which is not registered with the SEC, and does not trade publicly. As a financial holding company, our ability to pay\ncash dividends is dependent upon the ability of our bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay cash dividends. Future dividends will depend on our\nconsolidated earnings, capital and regulatory requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve\nrisks and uncertainties. Please see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and\nassumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be\nread in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our\nactual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,\nincluding those discussed in the section of this Form 10-K captioned “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. We provide a wide array of financial products and services including banking,\ntrust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, factoring, third-party administration, qualified plan recordkeeping and insurance services to individuals,\nsmall businesses and institutions across the United States.\nWe operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas on\nDecember 23, 2002 to serve as the bank holding company for the Bank, (ii) Sanders Morris, a registered broker-dealer with FINRA, and registered\ninvestment advisor with the SEC, (iii) Tectonic Advisors a registered investment advisor registered with the SEC focused generally on managing money\nfor relatively large, affiliated institutions and investment advisors, as well as for their clients, and (iv) HWG, an insurance agency registered with the TDI.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services primarily to small- to medium-sized businesses and their\nemployees, and other institutions. The Bank’s traditional fiduciary services clients primarily consist of clients of Cain Watters. The Bank also offers\nlending services, including commercial loans to small-to medium-sized businesses and professional concerns, as well as consumers, Nolan, operating\nfrom its office in Overland Park, Kansas as a division within the Bank, offers third party administration (“TPA”) services, and Integra, operating from its\nFort Worth, Texas office as a division within the Bank, offers factoring services.\nThe Bank’s technological capabilities, including worldwide free ATM withdrawals, sophisticated on-line banking capabilities, electronic funds\ntransfer capabilities, and economical remote deposit solutions, allow most customers to be served regardless of their geographic location. The Bank\nserves its local geographic market which includes Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, Collin and Rockwall counties which encompass an area commonly referred to\nas the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The Bank also provides focused services to the dental and other health professional industries through a centralized\nloan and deposit platform that operates out of its main office in Dallas, Texas. In addition, the Bank serves the small business community by offering\nloans guaranteed by the SBA and the USDA.\nSanders Morris provides brokerage, advisory, and wealth management services to high and ultra-high net worth individuals in a broad geographic\narea that includes Texas, with a concentration of clients in the Houston, Texas metroplex area, as well as clients across the United States. Tectonic\nAdvisors provides advisory and wealth management services primarily to affiliated institutions and their clients, including the Bank, Cain Watters, and\ntheir clients, under long-standing advisory and due diligence agreements.\nWe have three operating segments: Banking, Other Financial Services and HoldCo. Our banking operating segment encompasses both commercial\nand consumer banking services, as well as factoring services. Our Other Financial Services segment includes the activities of Tectonic Advisors, Sanders\nMorris, the Bank’s Trust Division, which includes Nolan, and HWG. Our HoldCo operating segment includes the Bank’s immediate parent, T Bancshares,\nand related subordinated debt, as well as operations of the financial holding company that serves as parent for the group overall. See the section entitled\nSegment Reporting, below, for more information.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, T Bancshares, the Bank, Tectonic\nAdvisors, Sanders Morris, and through Sanders Morris, HWG. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\n64\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare consolidated financial statements based on GAAP and customary practices within the financial services industry. These policies, in\ncertain areas, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying\nnotes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions\nabout matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have\nused for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period,\ncould have a material impact on the financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n(Topic 326) (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective on January 1, 2023, pursuant to the delayed adoption\nallowable for smaller reporting companies, replacing allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables, and allowance\nallocations calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies discussed in the 2022 Form 10-K. Upon adoption of the current expected\ncredit loss (“CECL”) methodology, the Company recorded an increase of $1.4 million to the allowance for credit losses for loans and $237,505 to the\nallowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments. In addition, the Company recognized a cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling\n$1.3 million, net of a recorded deferred tax asset of $341,662. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account,\ncalculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the\ncase of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a\ncomponent of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of\ncurrent expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing\nexposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit\nlosses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions\nor other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is\ndependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view\nof the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion as well\nas Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for more details on the impact of the\nCompany’s adoption of the CECL methodology, including related accounting policies.\nPerformance Summary\nNet income available to common shareholders decreased by $1.8 million, or 11.6%, to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $15.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Earnings per diluted common share were $1.87 and $2.11 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The decrease in net income for 2023 over 2022 included a $120,000 decrease in net interest income, a $236,000 decrease in non-interest\nincome, a $2.0 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $24,000 increase in the provision for credit losses, partly offset by a $586,000 decrease in\nincome tax expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses was lower in the current year mainly due to increased funding costs on our\ndeposit products due to federal funds rate increases over the last year offset to a lesser extent by increased earnings on interest earning assets, primarily\nloans and interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB. For the year ended December 31, 2023, annual return on average assets was 2.38%, compared to\n2.89% for the prior year, and annual return on average equity was 15.04%, compared to 18.88% for the prior year.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, this Form 10-K contains\nfinancial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, which includes return on average tangible common equity. We\ncalculate return on average tangible common equity as net income available to common shareholders (net income less dividends paid on preferred stock)\ndivided by average tangible common equity. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity is average total\nshareholders’ equity. We believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide\nmeaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures and ratios in\nassessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios\nshould be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, measures and ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n65\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles net income to income available to common shareholders and presents the calculation of return on average tangible\ncommon equity:\nAs of and for the As of and for the\nYear Ended Year Ended\n(In thousands, except percentages) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nIncome available to common shareholders $ 13,667 $ 15,478\nAverage shareholders’ equity $ 101,176 $ 90,194\nLess: average goodwill 21,440 21,440\nLess: average core deposit intangible 472 681\nLess: average preferred stock 17,250 17,250\nAverage tangible common equity $ 62,014 $ 50,823\nReturn on average tangible common equity 22.04% 30.45%\nTotal assets grew by $64.8 million, or 10.6%, to $677.3 million as of December 31, 2023, from $612.5 million as of December 31, 2022. This increase was\nprimarily due to increases of $49.0 million in loans held for investment, $16.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.9 million in investments, partly\noffset by a decrease of $7.3 million in loans held for sale.\nShareholders’ equity increased $10.4 million, or 10.8%, to $106.9 million as of December 31, 2023, from $96.5 million as of December 31, 2022. See\nanalysis of shareholders’ equity in the section captioned “Capital Resources and Regulatory Capital Requirements” included elsewhere in this\ndiscussion.\nResults of Operations\nDetails of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing\ncash, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume\nand spread, and are reflected in the net interest margin, as well as changes in average interest rates. Volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate\npaid on interest-bearing liabilities. Margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, and is influenced by the level and\nrelative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the\ninfluence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other\ngovernmental regulatory authorities. As of December 31, 2023, the target range for the federal funds rate was 5.25% to 5.50%.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the changes in net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of interest-\nearning assets and interest–bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in\nnet interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average\ninterest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each.\n2023 vs 2022\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to Change in\nAverage\n(In thousands) Rate Volume Total\nInterest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold $ 1,256 $ 895 $ 2,151\nSecurities 27 177 204\nLoans, net of unearned discount (1) 7,978 2,749 10,727\nTotal earning assets 9,261 3,821 13,082\nSavings and interest-bearing demand 27 (20) 7\nMoney market deposit accounts 4,398 116 4,514\nTime deposits 5,803 2,485 8,288\nFHLB and other borrowings 423 (315) 108\nSubordinated notes 285 - 285\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 10,936 2,266 13,202\nChanges in net interest income $ (1,675) $ 1,555 $ (120)\n(1) Include non-accrual loans.\nNet interest income decreased $120,000, or 0.4% from $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to $27.4 million for year ended December 31,\n2023. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 4.58% and 5.06%, respectively, a decrease of 48 basis points. The decrease\nin net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities as a result of the continued interest\nrate increases, and increases in the average volume of time deposits, partly offset by an increase in the average yield and average volume of loans and\ninterest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the FRB), and to a lesser extent an increase in the average volume of\nsecurities.\nThe average volume of interest-earning assets increased $54.5 million, or 10.0%, from $542.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to $597.1\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase during 2023 included a $32.5 million, or 7.1%, increase in the average volume of loans, a $17.7\nmillion, or 47.9%, increase in average volume interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), and\na $4.3 million, or 9.2%, increase in the average volume of securities.\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets increased 163 basis points from 6.15% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 7.78% for the year\nended December 31, 2023, due to the increasing rate environment, and changes in the mix of interest-earning assets. The average yield for loans increased\n174 basis points from 6.73% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 8.47% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The average yield on interest-bearing\ndeposits increased 339 basis points from 1.66% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 5.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The average yield\non securities increased 6 basis points from 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 4.11% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe average volume of interest-bearing liabilities increased $51.8 million, or 13.5%, from $383.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to\n$435.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase during 2023 included a $57.6 million, or 15.9%, increase in average volume of interest-\nbearing deposits, partly offset by a $5.8 million, or 66.2%, decrease in average volume of FHLB and other borrowings. The average interest rate paid on\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased 285 basis points from 1.54% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 4.39% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 287 basis points from 1.36% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 4.23% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The average cost of FHLB and other borrowings increased 485 basis points from 0.61% for the year ended December 31,\n2022, to 5.46% for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the average cost of subordinated notes increased 238 basis points from 7.59% for the year\nended December 31, 2022, to 9.97% for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the aforementioned significant increases in the market interest rates.\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth our average balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, in addition to the major components of net interest\nincome and our net interest margin, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAverage Average Average Average\n(In thousands, except percentages) Balance Interest Yield Balance Interest Yield\nAssets\nInterest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold $ 54,770 $ 2,764 5.05% $ 37,032 $ 613 1.66%\nSecurities 50,874 2,091 4.11 46,576 1,887 4.05\nLoans, net of unearned discount (1) 491,448 41,612 8.47 458,980 30,885 6.73\nTotal earning assets 597,092 46,467 7.78 542,588 33,385 6.15\nCash and other assets 48,320 49,995\nAllowance for credit losses (5,743) (4,192)\nTotal assets $ 639,669 $ 588,391\nLiabilities and Shareholders’ Equity\nSavings and interest-bearing demand $ 12,041 56 0.47% $ 16,287 49 0.30%\nMoney market deposit accounts 132,471 6,153 4.64 129,972 1,639 1.26\nTime deposits 275,540 11,540 4.19 216,196 3,252 1.50\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 420,052 17,749 4.23 362,455 4,940 1.36\nFHLB and other borrowings 2,951 161 5.46 8,730 53 0.61\nSubordinated notes 12,000 1,196 9.97 12,000 911 7.59\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 435,003 19,106 4.39 383,185 5,904 1.54\nNon-interest-bearing deposits 92,230 104,170\nOther liabilities 11,260 10,842\nTotal liabilities 538,493 498,197\nShareholders’ equity 101,176 90,194\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 639,669 $ 588,391\nNet interest income $ 27,361 $ 27,481\nNet interest spread 3.39% 4.61%\nNet interest margin 4.58% 5.06%\n(1) Includes non-accrual loans.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nAs discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany adopted the CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2023. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology\nis applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as off-balance sheet credit\nexposures. Provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types\nof financial instruments to bring the allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the\nrespective financial instruments. Management actively monitors the Company’s asset quality and provides appropriate provisions based on such factors\nas historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nFinancial instruments are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best\ninformation available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, forecasted economic conditions continue to remain uncertain\ndue to the rising interest rate environment and persistent high inflation levels in the United States. Accordingly, future adjustments may be necessary if\neconomic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the determination.\nThe following table presents the components of provision for credit losses:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nProvision for credit losses related to:\nLoans $ 1,333 $ 1,264\nHeld to maturity securities - -\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures (45) -\nTotal $ 1,288 $ 1,264\n68\nTable of Contents\nProvision expense for loans is generally reflective of change in loan volume and mix as well as charge-offs or specific reserves taken during the\nrespective period. Provision expense is also impacted by the economic outlook and changes in macroeconomic variables. The provision expense recorded\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 driven by the loss rate and charge-offs. See “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion\nfor further analysis of our provision for credit losses related to loans.\nChanges in the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures are generally driven by the remaining unfunded loan commitments expected to fund\nloans and to changes in the assumptions to project loss rates. The credit provision for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to decreased\noutstanding loan commitments to fund.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe components of non-interest income were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nTrust income $ 6,442 $ 6,098\nGain on sale of loans 581 -\nAdvisory income 14,910 13,549\nBrokerage income 7,527 11,754\nService fees and other income 10,037 8,293\nRental income 307 346\nTotal $ 39,804 $ 40,040\nTotal non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased $236,000, or 0.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nChanges in the various components of non-interest income are discussed below.\nTrust Income. Trust income is earned from trust services provided by the Bank on the value of managed and non-managed assets held in custody.\nChanges in asset values and the volatility of the bond and equity markets impact the market value of trust assets and the related fees. Trust income for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, increased $344,000, or 5.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The fee income increased between the\ntwo years due to an increase in the average market value of the trust assets over the year ended December 31, 2023, from an increase in asset values of\n$326.2 million between the two periods from net asset inflows to the Bank’s Trust Division of $71.8 million and asset appreciation of $254.4 million.\nGain on sale of loans. The gain on sale of loans primarily reflects the gain from the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) and USDA loans\noriginated by the Bank’s SBA lending group. Gain on sale of loans increased $581,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023, during which there was a\ngain on sale of loans resulting from the sale of $5.8 million of USDA loans.\nAdvisory income. Advisory fees are typically based on a percentage of the underlying average asset value for a given period, where each\npercentage point represents 100 basis points. These revenues are of a recurring nature but are directly affected by increases and decreases in the values\nof the underlying assets. In addition to fees based on a percentage of underlying assets, payments under certain advisory agreements at Sanders Morris\nare based on the performance of the respective account, measured as a percentage of the increase achieved in the asset values in the respective account.\nPerformance-based fees, though the agreements may remain in place from year to year, are far less predictable, given the uncertainty of the ability to\nachieve an increase of the same level as in prior periods, or at all. For the year ended December 31, 2023, advisory income increased $1.4 million, or 10%,\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase during the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due an increase in advisory fees\nbased on a percentage of the underlying assets at Tectonic Advisors totaling $1.1 million and an increase in advisory fees based on a percentage of\nunderlying assets at Sanders Morris totaling $261,000.\nBrokerage income. Brokerage revenues are generally based on a per share fee or commission to trade a share of a particular stock, bond or other\nsecurity. In addition, brokerage revenues in this context include private placements, participation in syndication of public offerings, and certain other\nbrokerage revenues, including interest earned on margin lending. Brokerage revenue is dependent on the volume of trading, cash held in brokerage\naccounts which funds margin lending, and on private placement and syndication activity during the period. Brokerage income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, decreased $4.2 million, or 36.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in private\nplacement activity of $3.1 million, offset by a slight increase in syndicate deals of $292,000, and a decline in traditional brokerage activity of $1.6 million. In\naddition, revenue from margin lending declined $468,000 and insurance commissions fell by $104,000. These decreases were offset by an increase in\nfederated rebates of $819,000.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe table below reflects a rollforward of our client assets, which includes both advisory and brokerage assets, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the inflows and outflows and market appreciation during the years then ended. Our brokerage and advisory assets experienced an increase of\napproximately $1.7 billion, or 33.5%, and an increase of $409.8 million, or 7.3%, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nincrease for the year ended December 31, 2023 was related to market appreciation of $821 million, or 15.8%, and positive net flows of $869 million, or\n16.7%.\n(In thousands) Tectonic Advisors Sanders Morris Total\nAs of January 1, 2022 $ 2,852,980 $ 2,756,332 $ 5,609,312\nClient inflows 857,461 1,545,368 2,402,829\nClient outflows (492,064) (1,350,240) (1,842,304)\nNet flows 365,397 195,128 560,525\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) (494,912) (475,454) (970,366)\nAs of December 31, 2022 2,723,465 $ 2,476,006 $ 5,199,471\nClient inflows 956,123 1,459,223 2,415,346\nClient outflows (477,325) (1,068,957) (1,546,282)\nNet flows 478,798 390,266 869,064\nMarket appreciation 446,142 375,015 821,157\nAs of December 31, 2023 $ 3,648,405 $ 3,241,287 $ 6,889,692\nService fees and other income. Service fees include fees for deposit-related services and third-party administrative fees from the Bank’s Nolan\ndivision. Service fees and other income for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased $1.7 million, or 21.0%, compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022. The increase was primarily the result of increases in pension administration fees of $1.4 million and an increase in other income from the recovery of\nunclaimed funds at Sanders Morris of $264,000, and other material fluctuations netting to an increase of $59,000. The increases in pension administration\nfees are the result of increases in plans administration clients in 2023 and an increase in fees related to plan terminations, for which two years of\nadministration must be prepared. In addition, loan service fees increased $165,000 and bank service fees increased $121,000. These increases were offset\nby a loss on the disposition of not readily marketable securities of $100,000 in our HoldCo segment, and by an allowance of $217,000 related to not readily\nmarketable securities in our Other Financial Services segment.\nRental income. The Company receives monthly rental income from tenants leasing space in the bank building. Rental income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, decreased $39,000, or 11.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a decrease in occupancy in 2023 compared to\n2022.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe components of non-interest expense were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 31,288 $ 31,093\nOccupancy and equipment 1,984 1,707\nTrust expenses 2,265 2,243\nBrokerage and advisory direct costs 1,936 2,015\nProfessional fees 1,813 1,480\nData processing 941 794\nOther expense 6,594 5,473\nTotal $ 46,821 $ 44,805\nTotal non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased $2.0 million, or 4.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nChanges in the various components of non-interest income are discussed below.\n70\nTable of Contents\nSalaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits include employee salaries and related payroll expense, incentive compensation,\nhealth insurance, benefit plans and payroll taxes. Salaries and employee benefits for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased $195,000, or 0.6%,\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. In our Other Financial Services segment, salaries and employee benefits decreased $2.2 million. The\ndecrease was primarily from a decrease in incentive bonuses at Sanders Morris related to decreases in traditional brokerage, private placement, and\nsyndicated offerings activity of $2.4 million, offset by an increase in commission salaries of $64,000, and an increase in salaries, payroll taxes, and other\nbenefits of $196,000. Salaries, bonuses and payroll taxes at Tectonic Advisors decreased $614,000, due to the move of the technology and accounting\nstaff to the HoldCo segment, where salaries, bonuses and payroll taxes increased $1.4 million. Salaries, bonuses and payroll taxes at the Bank’s Nolan\ndivision increased $347,000 related to staff increases and overtime pay to accommodate the increase in the number of plans administered and merit\nincreases. Salaries, taxes and other benefits in our trust group within our Other Financial Services segment increased $222,000 related to staffing additions\nto accommodate additional recordkeeping clients and duplication of personnel during staff changes as well as retention bonuses. Salaries and employee\nbenefits in our Banking segment increased $947,000, primarily driven by increases in staff and merit increases of $1.6 million, $571,000 of which was within\nthe Bank’s Integra division. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bonuses of $697,000, which decrease was primarily related to a decrease\nin lending activity in the Bank’s SBA team.\nOccupancy and equipment expense. Occupancy and equipment expenses include building, furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation and\nmaintenance costs. Occupancy and equipment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased $277,000, or 16.2%, compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase is primarily due to an increase in occupancy and equipment expense in our Other Financial Services and HoldCo\nsegments of $222,000 led by an increase in rent of $219,000 from Sanders Morris’ and Tectonic Advisors’ new lease agreements. Occupancy and\nequipment expense in our Banking segment increased $55,000, primarily from an increase of $43,000 in facilities expense at the bank facility, offset by a\ndecrease in rent expense of $14,000 at Integra. Depreciation expense increased $19,000, due to increases in furniture, fixtures and equipment and building\nimprovements across all segments. The remaining variances in our occupancy and equipment expense were individually immaterial.\nTrust expenses. Trust expenses are incurred in our Other Financial Services segment, and include advisory fees paid on the common trust funds\nmanaged by the Company based on the value of the assets held in custody. Changes in asset values and the volatility of the bond and equity markets\nimpacts the market value of trust assets and the related expenses. The monthly advisory fees are assessed based on the market value of assets at month-\nend. Trust expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $22,000, or 1.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, based on\nincreases in asset values of the Bank’s common trust funds.\nBrokerage and advisory direct costs. Brokerage and advisory direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased $79,000, or 3.9%,\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Brokerage and advisory direct costs are incurred primarily in our Other Financial Services segment and\ninclude the cost of clearing firm services and fees on advisory assets from custodians and certain referral fees, as well as information services related to\nour advisory and trading activity. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in brokerage and advisory direct costs at Sanders Morris and HWG of\n$73,000, related to a decrease in exchange clearing fees, advisory clearing fees and referral fees of $177,000, offset by an increase in clearing firm service\nfees, execution charges, information services and service fees of $104,000. Tectonic Advisors’ brokerage and advisory direct costs decreased $7,000, due\nto decreases in service and referral fees of $14,000, offset by an increase in information services of $7,000.\nProfessional fees. Professional fees, which include legal, consulting, audit and tax fees, for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased $333,000, or\n22.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was the result of increases in our HoldCo segment of $210,000, primarily due to\nprofessional consulting fees for projects involving robotic process automation, and increases in professional fees in our Banking segment of $152,000,\nprimarily related to collections efforts on past due loans and various other matters, including our regulatory filings. These increases were offset by a\ndecrease in our Other Financial Services segment of $29,000, due to a decrease in professional fees at Sanders Morris, and in consulting, actuarial, and\nauditing fees at the Bank’s Nolan division and other individually immaterial fluctuations elsewhere in this segment.\nData processing. Data processing includes costs related to the Company’s operating systems. Data processing expenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, increased $147,000, or 18.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to increases in data processing\nexpenses within the Banking segment of $125,000 and an increase of $22,000 in our Other Financial Services segment. The increase in our Banking\nsegment was related to discounts the Bank was receiving from the core system vendor from the conversion in 2021 that were exhausted during 2023,\nalong with general increases in other data processing services. The increase in our Other Financial Services segment was related to an increase in costs at\nthe Bank’s Trust Division of $18,000 and immaterial increases at the Bank’s Nolan division.\n71\nTable of Contents\nOther expense. Other expenses include costs for insurance, FDIC and OCC assessments, director fees, and regulatory filing fees related to our\nbrokerage business, business travel, management fees, and other operational expenses.

Revenue from margin lending declined $468,000 and insurance commissions fell\nby $104,000. These decreases were offset by an increase in federated rebates of $819,000. The decrease in brokerage income was partially offset by\nincreases in trust and advisory income of $1.7 million from net inflows and appreciation, and an increase in service fees and other income of $1.6 million,\nprimarily from increased plan administration revenue at the Bank’s Nolan division. See the analysis of non-interest income included in the section\ncaptioned “Non-Interest Income” above in this discussion.\n73\nTable of Contents\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased $2.0 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily from a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $2.2 million. In addition, brokerage and advisory direct costs decreased\n$79,000, and professional fees decreased $29,000.

Non-interest income decreased $114,000 which was primarily due to a loss on the disposition of not readily\nmarketable securities of $100,000. Non-interest expense increased $2.0 million, which included an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.4 million,\nprimarily related to the movement of accounting and technology staff from Tectonic Advisors to Tectonic Financial, Inc., to allow for more accurate\nallocation of costs given that these personnel frequently work on matters across the business.

In managing the portfolio, the Company seeks to attain the objectives of safety of\nprincipal, liquidity, diversification, and maximized return on investment. Securities are classified as available for sale when we intend to hold for an\nindefinite period of time but might be sold before maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses\nreported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

PACE assessments are created to fund the purchase and installation of energy saving improvements to the\nproperty such as solar panels. PID/TIRZ assessments are used to pay for the development costs of a residential subdivision. Generally, as a property\nassessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32 years by the then current property owner(s). Each installment is\ncollected by the County or City Tax Collector where the property is located. The assessments are an obligation of the property.\nRestricted securities consisted of FRB stock, having an amortized cost and fair value of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and FHLB\nstock, having an amortized cost and fair value of $2.0 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSecurities not readily marketable consists of an income interest in a private investment.

The increase includes $10.6 million for SBA loans, $48.3 million for real estate loans and $2.6 million increase in factored receivables.\nThe increases were partly offset by a $10.5 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans. SBA loans comprise the largest group of loans in our\nportfolio totaling $268.9 million, or 53.7% of the total loans at December 31, 2023, compared to $258.3 million, or 57.4%, of the total loans at December 31,\n2022. Commercial and industrial loans totaled $82.5 million, or 16.5%, of the total loans at December 31, 2023, compared to $92.9 million, or 20.6%, of the\ntotal loans at December 31, 2022.

Loans held\nfor sale totaled $26.6 million and $33.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company elected\nto reclassify $52.6 million of the SBA loans held for sale to held for investment. The Company determined that holding these loans provides better long-\nterm risk adjusted returns than selling the loans.\nLoan Origination/Risk Management. The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income\nwith an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on an annual basis and makes changes as appropriate.\nManagement receives and reviews monthly reports related to loan originations, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and\nnonperforming and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic\nconditions, both by type of loan and geographic location.\nCommercial and industrial loans, which are predominantly loans to dentists, are underwritten based on historical and projected income of the\nbusiness and individual borrowers and guarantors. The Company utilizes a comprehensive global debt service coverage analysis to determine debt\nservice coverage ratios. This analysis compares global cash flow of the borrowers and guarantors on an individual credit to existing and proposed debt\nafter consideration of personal and business related other expenses. Collateral is generally a lien on all available assets of the business borrower\nincluding intangible assets. Credit worthiness of individual borrowers and guarantors is established through the use of credit reports and credit scores.\nConsumer loans are evaluated on the basis of credit worthiness as established through the use of credit reports and credit scores. Additional credit\nquality indicators include borrower debt to income ratios based on verifiable income sources.\nReal estate mortgage loans are evaluated based on collateral value as well as global debt service coverage ratios based on historical and projected\nincome from all related sources including the collateral property, the borrower, and all guarantors where applicable.\nThe Company originates SBA loans which are sometimes sold into the secondary market. The Company continues to service these loans after sale\nand is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts. The two primary SBA loan programs that the Company offers are the basic SBA 7(a)\nllooaann gguuaarraannttyy pprrooggrraamm aanndd tthhee SSBBAA 550044 llooaann pprrooggrraamm iinn ccoonnjjuunnccttiioonn wwiitthh jjuunniioorr lliieenn ffiinnaanncciinngg ffrroomm aa CCeerrttiiffiieedd DDeevveellooppmmeenntt CCoommppaannyy ((““CCDDCC””))..\nThe SBA 7(a) program serves as the SBA’s primary business loan program to help qualified small businesses obtain financing when they might not\nbe eligible for business loans through normal lending channels. Loan proceeds under this program can be used for most business purposes including\nworking capital, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, land and building (including purchase, renovation and new construction), leasehold\nimprovements and debt refinancing. Loan maturity is generally up to 10 years for non-real estate collateral and up to 25 years for real estate collateral. The\nSBA 7(a) loan is approved and funded by a qualified lender, partially guaranteed by the SBA and subject to applicable regulations. In general, the SBA\nguarantees up to 75% of the loan amount depending on loan size. The Company is required by the SBA to service the loan and retain a contractual\nminimum of 5% on all SBA 7(a) loans, but generally retains 25% (the unguaranteed portion). The servicing spread is 1% of the guaranteed portion of the\nloan that is sold in the secondary market.\nThe SBA 504 program is an economic development-financing program providing long-term, low down payment loans to businesses. Typically, an\nSBA 504 project includes a loan secured from a private-sector lender with a senior lien, a loan secured from a CDC (funded by a 100% SBA-guaranteed\ndebenture) with a junior lien covering up to 40% of the total cost, and a contribution of at least 10% equity from the borrower. Debenture limits are $5.0\nmillion for regular 504 loans and $5.5 million for those SBA 504 loans that meet a public policy goal.\nThe SBA has designated the Bank as a “Preferred Lender”. As a Preferred Lender, the Bank has been delegated loan approval, closing and most\nservicing and liquidation authority from the SBA.\nThe Company also offers Business & Industry (“B&I”) program loans through the USDA. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they\nare guaranteed by the USDA. The guaranteed amount is generally 80%. B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally\nlarger loans to larger businesses than the SBA 7(a) loans. Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market. These loans can be\nutilized for rural commercial real estate and equipment. The loans can have maturities up to 30 years and the rates can be fixed or variable.\nConstruction and land development loans are evaluated based on the borrower’s and guarantor’s credit worthiness, past experience in the industry,\ntrack record and experience with the type of project being considered, and other factors. Collateral value is determined generally by independent appraisal\nutilizing multiple approaches to determine value based on property type.\n77\nTable of Contents\nFor all loan types, the Company establishes guidelines for its underwriting criteria including collateral coverage ratios, global debt service coverage\nratios, and maximum amortization or loan maturity terms.\nLoan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause\nthem to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. As of December 31, 2023, our loan portfolio included $78.2 million of loans, approximately\n15.6% of our total funded loans to the dental industry, as compared to $83.9 million of loans, approximately 18.6% of our total funded loans December 31,\n2022. We believe that these loans are to credit worthy borrowers and are diversified geographically.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 65.8% of the loan portfolio, or $329.5 million, matured or re-priced within one year or less. The following table presents the\ncontractual maturity ranges for loans outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and also presents portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or floating\nadjustable interest rates over the life of the loan in accordance with changes in the interest rate environment:\nMaturity Distribution of Loan Portfolio\nOver One Over Five\nYear Years\nOne Year Through Through Over Fifteen Total Loans\n(In thousands) or Less Five Years Fifteen Years Years Receivable\nCommercial and industrial $ 5,786 $ 12,405 $ 64,292 $ - $ 82,483\nConsumer installment 350 550 - - 900\nReal estate – residential 203 7,847 - 131 8,181\nReal estate – commercial 28,924 34,821 3,461 1,586 68,792\nReal estate – construction and land 43,533 1,130 - - 44,663\nSBA 7(a) guaranteed 142,799 17,147 1,318 880 162,144\nSBA 7(a) unguaranteed 56,722 7,276 324 536 64,858\nSBA 504 24,042 15,361 2,503 - 41,906\nUSDA 2,124 - - - 2,124\nFactored Receivables 25,044 - - - 25,044\nTotal $ 329,527 $ 96,537 $ 71,898 $ 3,133 $ 501,095\nLoans Due After One Year\nFloating or\n(In thousands) Fixed Rate Adjustable Rate Total\nCommercial and industrial $ 74,196 $ 2,501 $ 76,697\nConsumer installment 550 - 550\nReal estate – residential 6,512 1,466 7,978\nReal estate – commercial 7,471 32,397 39,868\nReal estate – construction and land 922 208 1,130\nSBA 7(a) guaranteed 4,164 15,181 19,345\nSBA 7(a) unguaranteed 1,635 6,501 8,136\nSBA 504 - 17,864 17,864\nUSDA - - -\nFactored Receivables - - -\nTotal $ 95,450 $ 76,118 $ 171,568\nScheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans is less than their average\ncontractual terms due to prepayments.\nLoans acquired in acquisitions are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. The fair value of the\nloans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be\ncollected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Under the accounting model for acquired loans, the\nexcess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of the loans, referred to as the “accretable yield,” is accreted into interest income\nover the life of the loans.\n78\nTable of Contents\nNon-performing Assets\nOur primary business segments are banking and other financial services, and as outlined above, the banking segment’s primary business is lending.\nThat activity entails potential credit losses, the magnitude of which depends on a variety of economic factors affecting borrowers which are beyond our\ncontrol. While we have instituted underwriting guidelines and policies and credit review procedures to protect us from avoidable credit losses, some\nlosses will inevitably occur.\nNon-performing assets include non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets\ntotaled $2.6 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $2.8 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, non-performing assets consisted\nof SBA non-accrual loans totaling $2.4 million, of which all except $251,000 was guaranteed by the SBA, and commercial real estate loans totaling\n$221,000.\nLoans are considered past due when principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments are contractually due.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan interest and generally when such loans\nare 90 days or more past due. Accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued. Subsequent payments received on non-accrual loans are\nrecorded as reductions of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. A loan is considered impaired\nwhen it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the original loan contract. Loans past due 90 days or more and\nstill accruing interest totaled $147,000 in factored receivables as of December 31, 2023, compared to $206,000 in residential real estate and $132,000 in\nfactored receivables as of December 31, 2022.\nForeclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value,\nless estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible credit losses.\nOn an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs are provided for subsequent\ndeclines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. There were no foreclosed\nassets as of December 31, 2023, and 2022.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding non-performing assets by type, including ratios of such loans to total assets as of the\ndates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022\nNon-accrual loans:\nCommercial and industrial $ 93 $ -\nReal estate – commercial 128 138\nSBA guaranteed 1,951 2,221\nSBA unguaranteed 251 107\nTotal non-accrual loans 2,423 2,466\nReal estate – residential past due 90 days - 206\nFactored receivables past due 90 days 147 132\nForeclosed assets - -\nTotal non-performing assets $ 2,570 $ 2,804\nAs a % of total loans 0.51% 0.65%\nAs a % of total assets 0.38 0.48\n79\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAs discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, our policies\nand procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on January 1, 2023, in connection with the adoption of the CECL methodology as codified\nin ASC 326. In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with ASC 326,\nthat are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When management deems all or a\nportion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is charged-off against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the\nallowance. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326,\nreported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management’s best\nestimate of CECL on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to\ncredit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments\nto historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant\nfactors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a\nvariety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory\nauthorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected\nin order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, except that the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools. For dental and SBA 7(a) loans, the Company adjusts\nthe pool life for expected prepayment speeds.\nFor all loan pools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss\nrate over two years on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss\ndriver forecasts over the two year forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when\ndeveloping the forecast metrics.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit\nlosses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics. See the discussion of Q-Factors\ndescribed below.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The allowance\nfor credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the open pool method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an\nindividual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an\nallowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value\nof that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual\nterm excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt\nrestructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the\nreporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors (“Q-Factor”) that are not considered within our modeling processes but are\nnonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or\ndecrease management’s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks\nthat may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies,\nprocedures and strategies; (ii) staff experience; (iii) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (iv) concentration\nrisk; (v) trends in underlying collateral values; (vi) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; and (vii) economic conditions.\n80\nTable of Contents\nUpon the adoption of ASC 326 effective on January 1, 2023, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated using the CECL\nmethodology increased $1.4 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated as of December 31, 2022 using the\nprior incurred loss model under GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses, the percentage of loans in each category to total gross loans and the\nratio of allowance allocated to loans in each category as of the date indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAllocated % of Loan Allocated % of Loan\n(In thousands, except percentages) Allowance Portfolio ACL to Loans Allowance Portfolio ACL to Loans\nCommercial and industrial $ 2,495 16.5% 3.0% $ 1,301 20.6% 1.4%\nConsumer installment 18 0.2 2.0 14 0.2 1.3\nReal estate – residential 71 1.6 0.9 79 1.2 1.4\nReal estate – commercial 616 13.7 0.9 899 14.2 1.4\nReal estate – construction and land 143 8.9 0.3 55 0.9 1.4\nSBA 2,484 53.7 0.9 1,505 57.4 0.6\nUSDA 19 0.4 0.9 52 0.5 2.3\nFactored receivables 462 5.0 1.8 608 5.0 2.7\nTotal Loans $ 6,308 100.0% 1.3% $ 4,513 100.0% 1.0%\nThe table below presents a summary of the Company’s net loan credit experience and provisions to the allowance for credit losses for the period\nindicated:\nAs of and for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022\nAverage loans outstanding $ 491,448 $ 458,980\nGross loans held for investment outstanding at end of period $ 501,095 $ 450,332\nAllowance for credit losses at beginning of period $ 4,513 $ 4,152\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 1,390 -\nProvision for credit losses 1,333 1,264\nCharge offs:\nCommercial and industrial (214) (337)\nSBA 7(a) (329) (43)\nFactored Receivables (637) (617)\nTotal charge-offs (1,180) (997)\nRecoveries:\nCommercial and industrial 14 31\nSBA 7(a) 69 22\nFactored Receivables 169 41\nTotal recoveries 252 94\nNet charge-offs (928) (903)\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period $ 6,308 $ 4,513\nRatio of allowance to end of period loans 1.26% 1.00%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans 0.19% 0.20%\nDeposits\nDeposits are attracted principally from our primary geographic market area with the exception of time deposits, which, due to the Company’s\nattractive rates, are attracted from across the nation. The Company offers a broad selection of deposit products, including demand deposit accounts,\nNOW accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans (such as IRAs). Deposit\naccount terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the\nassociated interest rates. Management sets the deposit interest rates periodically based on a review of deposit flows and a survey of rates among\ncompetitors and other financial institutions. The Company relies on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain\ndeposits, and also on CD listing services.\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe Company participates in the One-Way Buy Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) service, which provides for one-way buy transactions among banks for\nthe purpose of purchasing cost-effective floating-rate funding without collateralization or stock purchase requirements. Management believes these\nsources represent a reliable and cost-efficient alternative funding source for the Company. However, to the extent that our condition or reputation\ndeteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which we do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of\nbrokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding. As of December 31, 2023, total deposits included $50.0\nmillion of ICS brokered deposits.\nTotal deposits increased $33.9 million, or 10.7%, to $526.9 million as of December 31, 2023, from $493.0 million as of December 31, 2022.

The Company determines its\nborrowing needs and renews the advances accordingly at varying terms. The Company had no borrowings with FHLB as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company also has a credit line with the FRB with borrowing capacity of $43.5 million, which is secured by commercial loans. The company had\nno borrowings from the FRB at December 31, 2023 and 2022 under this credit line. During 2023, the FRB offered loans of up to one year in length under the\nBTFP to banks and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S treasures, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets\nas collateral, which are assessed at par value. The Bank pledged available for sale securities with par value of $23.3 million to provide additional liquidity\nto meet the needs of depositors as of December 31, 2023. The Company had $21.0 million of borrowings related to the BTFP as of December 31, 2023.\n82\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, T Bancshares had subordinated notes totaling $12.0 million, consisting of $8.0 million issued in 2017 bearing an\ninterest rate of three month LIBOR plus 5.125%, with interest payable quarterly and maturing on July 20, 2027, at which all principal is due, and $4.0 million\nissued in 2018 bearing interest rate of 7.125% payable semi-annually up to July 17, 2023, after which it converted to three month LIBOR plus 5.125%, with\ninterest payable quarterly and maturing on March 31, 2028, at which all principal is due. The subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated in right\nof payment to the payment of our existing and future senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of our\nsubsidiaries. Beginning July 1, 2023, in accordance with the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and the rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve\nthereunder, T Bancshares’ outstanding subordinated notes transitioned to SOFR index.\nCapital Resources and Regulatory Capital Requirements\nShareholders’ equity increased $10.4 million, or 10.7%, to $106.9 million as of December 31, 2023, from $96.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The\nincrease included net income of $15.2 million, $302,000 related to stock compensation expense, $548,000 net after-tax other comprehensive income, along\nwith $250,000 related to the reduction in note receivable utilized to exercise stock options. The increases were partly offset by the repurchase of common\nstock in the amount of $1.1 million and dividends paid on the Series B preferred stock and on the common stock in the amounts of $1.6 million and $2.0\nmillion, respectively, and a $1.3 million reduction in retained earnings related to the adoption of ASC326 on January 1, 2023.\nTogether with the Bank, the Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could\nhave a direct material effect on the Bank’s and, accordingly, the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are\nalso subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of December 31, 2023, the Company and\nthe Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under the\nprompt corrective action regulations of Basel III and the OCC.\nQuantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in\nthe table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), common equity Tier 1\ncapital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the\nregulations).\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios, as well as those of the Bank, as of the dates indicated:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTectonic Financial, Inc.\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 86,847 13.97% $ 76,805 13.27%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk Weighted Assets) 69,597 15.74 59,555 14.80\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 86,847 19.65 76,805 19.09\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 92,385 20.90 81,317 20.21\nT Bank, N.A.\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 87,488 13.97% $ 76,767 13.47%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk Weighted Assets) 87,488 20.04 76,767 19.29\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 87,488 20.04 76,767 19.29\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 92,957 21.29 81,279 20.42\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris is subject to the regulatory framework applicable to\nregistered investment advisors under the SEC’s Division of Investment Management. Sanders Morris is also regulated by FINRA, which, among other\nrequirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2023, Sanders Morris is in compliance with FINRA’s net regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n83\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity relates to our ability to maintain a steady flow of funds to support our ongoing operating, investing and financing activities. Our board\nof directors establishes policies and analyzes and manages liquidity to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet normal operating requirements in\naddition to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable\nsupply of core deposits and funds. Ultimately, public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital\nposition. Liquidity management is viewed from a long-term and a short-term perspective as well as from an asset and liability perspective. We monitor\nliquidity through a regular review of loan and deposit maturities and forecasts, incorporating this information into a detailed projected cash flow model.\nThe Bank’s liquidity is monitored by its management, the Asset-Liability Committee and its board of directors who review historical funding\nrequirements, current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated\nfuture funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments.\nThe Company’s primary sources of funds are retail, small business, custodial, commercial deposits, loan repayments, maturity of investment\nsecurities, other short-term borrowings, and other funds provided by operations. Our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional\nfunds as needed in the wholesale markets. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and loan\nprepayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions, and competition. The Company will maintain investments in liquid assets\nbased upon management’s assessment of (1) the need for funds, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on short-term liquid assets, and (4)\nobjectives of the asset/liability management program.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $58.8 million, or 8.7% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. In addition to the on balance sheet\nliquidity available, the Company has lines of credit with the FHLB and the FRB, which provide the Company with a source of off-balance sheet liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $56.8 million, or 8.4% of assets, none of which was utilized, and\nborrowing capacity with the FRB was $43.5 million, or 6.4% of assets. During March 2023, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP, which was made\navailable to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system. The BTFP allows the whole par value of available for sale\nsecurities to be included as the collateral value. As of December 31, 2023, securities with a par value of $23.3 million were pledged to the Federal Reserve\nunder this program, of which $21.0 million was borrowed against. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $160.3 million of\nSBA guaranteed loans held for investment that could be sold to investors.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers.\nThese financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements\nof credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the\nother party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those\ninstruments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of credit extended is\nbased on management’s credit evaluation of the customer and, if deemed necessary, may require collateral.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents future contractual obligations to make future payments, excluding interest, for the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2023\nOver Three\nLess than One to to Over Five\n(In thousands) One Year Three Years Five Years Years Total\nFHLB borrowings $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nFRB borrowings 21,000 - - - 21,000\nSubordinated notes - - - 12,000 12,000\nTime deposits 250,876 54,287 3,272 - 308,435\nMinimum lease payments 682 1,278 407 524 2,891\nTotal $ 272,558 $ 55,565 $ 3,679 $ 12,524 $ 344,326\nThe following table presents contractual financial commitments for the periods indicated, however some of these commitments may expire unused or\nonly partially used, so the total amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2023\nOver Three\nLess than One to to Over Five\n(In thousands) One Year Three Years Five Years Years Total\nUndisbursed loan commitments $ 8,411 $ 2,041 $ 111 $ 35,180 $ 45,743\nStandby letters of credit 162 - - - 162\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is\ncalculated under the CECL model, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk\nresulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit detailed above. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by\nloan segment at each balance sheet date using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur\nbased on historical utilization rates. Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the impact of adoption was $238,000 to the allowance for credit losses\nfor off-balance-sheet credit exposure, and subsequent to adoption we recognized a credit loss benefit related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures\ntotaling $45,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, leaving a balance of $193,000 in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit\nexposures as of December 31, 2023. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses for off-\nbalance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial\nstatements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nAs a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability management policy provides management\nwith guidelines for effective funds management and we have established a measurement system for monitoring the net interest rate sensitivity position.\nFluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the\nmarket value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the\npotential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a\nloss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent\nrisk while at the same time maximizing income.\nWe manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We use no off-balance-sheet financial\ninstruments to manage interest rate risk.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank’s Asset Liability Committee in accordance with policies approved by the Bank’s board of\ndirectors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the\ncommittee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, liquidity, business\nstrategies and other factors.\n85\nTable of Contents\nThe Asset Liability Committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the\nbook and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the\nmaturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and\ncommercial deposit activity. We employ methodologies to manage interest rate risk which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning\nassets and interest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model.\nWe use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the impact of changes in\ninterest rates on other financial metrics. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net\ninterest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model’s\nsimulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing\nof various management strategies.\nOn at least an annual basis, we run various stress tests to measure the impact on net interest income from changes in market interest rates under\nvarious scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a twelve-month horizon based upon parallel\nyield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario.\nAdditionally, we run non-parallel simulation involving analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve.\nThe Company’s asset liability management model indicated that it was in an asset sensitive position in terms of its income simulation as of December\n31, 2023. The following table summarizes the impact of an instantaneous, sustained simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\n% Change in Net\nChange in Interest Rates (basis points) Interest Income\n+200 20.71\n+100 15.97\n-100 6.83\n-200 2.82\nWe have found that, historically, interest rates on deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This\nassumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis, meaning that process by which we measure the\ngap between interest rate sensitive assets verses interest rate sensitive liabilities. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain\nand, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on\nnet interest income. Actual results will differ from the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as\nchanges in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.\n86\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nTectonic Financial, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tectonic Financial, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required\nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\n/s/ Whitley Penn LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nPlano, Texas\nApril 1, 2024\n87\nTable of Contents\nTECTONIC FINANCIAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nASSETS\nCash and due from banks $ 5,016 $ 8,549\nInterest-bearing deposits 52,481 32,562\nFederal funds sold 1,270 1,044\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 58,767 42,155\nSecurities available for sale 22,977 20,633\nSecurities held to maturity 24,194 25,262\nSecurities, restricted at cost 4,176 3,496\nSecurities, not readily marketable -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Nature of Operations\nTectonic Financial, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a financial holding company that offers, through its subsidiaries, banking and other\nfinancial services including trust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, factoring, third-party administration, qualified plan recordkeeping and\ninsurance services to individuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States.\nWe operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. (“T Bancshares”), which was incorporated under the laws of the\nState of Texas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the bank holding company for T Bank, N.A., a national association (the “Bank”), (ii) Sanders Morris LLC\n(“Sanders Morris”), a registered broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and registered investment advisor with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), (iii) Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic Advisors”) a registered investment advisor registered with the SEC\nfocused generally on managing money for relatively large, affiliated institutions as well as for their clients, which include individuals, businesses, and\nqualified plans and (iv) HWG Insurance Agency LLC (“HWG”), an insurance agency registered with the Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”).\nWe are headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Bank operates through a main office located at 16200 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas. Our other\nsubsidiaries operate from offices in Houston, Dallas, and Plano, Texas. Our Houston office is located at 600 Travis Street, 59th Floor, Houston, Texas, and\nincludes the home offices of Sanders Morris and HWG, as well as Tectonic Advisors’ family office services team. Our Dallas office, which is a branch\noffice of Sanders Morris, is at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 470, Dallas, Texas. Our main office for Tectonic Advisors is located at 17 Cowboys Way, Suite 250,\nFrisco, Texas, and also includes a branch office of HWG.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services primarily to small- to medium-sized businesses and their\nemployees, and other institutions. The Nolan Company (“Nolan”), operating from its office in Overland Park, Kansas as a division within the bank, offers\nthird party administration (“TPA”) services, and Integra Funding Solutions, LLC (“Integra”), also operating as a division within the Bank from Integra’s\noffice in Fort Worth, Texas, offers factoring services. The Bank’s technological capabilities, including worldwide free ATM withdrawals, sophisticated on-\nline banking capabilities, electronic funds transfer capabilities, and economical remote deposit solutions, allow most customers to be served regardless of\ntheir geographic location. The Bank serves its local geographic market which includes Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, Collin and Rockwall counties in Texas\nwhich encompass an area commonly referred to as the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The Bank also serves the dental and other health professional\nindustries through a centralized loan and deposit platform that operates out of its main office in Dallas, Texas. In addition, the Bank serves the small\nbusiness community by offering loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).\nThe Bank offers a wide range of deposit services including demand deposits, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, individual\nretirement accounts, and certificates of deposit with fixed rates and a range of maturity options. Lending services include commercial loans to small- to\nmedium-sized businesses and professional concerns as well as consumers. The Bank also offers wealth management and trust services. The Bank’s\ntraditional fiduciary services clients primarily consist of clients of Cain Watters & Associates L.L.C. (“Cain Watters”). The Bank, Cain Watters and\nTectonic Advisors entered into an advisory services agreement related to the trust operations in April 2006, which has been amended from time to time,\nmost recently in July 2016. See Note 13, Related Parties, to these consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, the Nolan division\nof the Bank offers TPA services and provides clients with retirement plan design and administrative services, specializing in ministerial recordkeeping,\nadministration, actuarial and design services for retirement plans of small businesses and professional practices. We believe offering TPA services allows\nus to serve our clients more fully and to attract new clients to our trust platform.\nBasis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, T\nBancshares, the Bank, Tectonic Advisors, Sanders Morris, and through Sanders Morris, HWG. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated\nin consolidation.\n93\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period, as well as the disclosures provided. Changes in\nassumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates. The determination of the allowance for credit losses, the fair value of stock\noptions, the fair values of financial instruments and other real estate owned, and the status of contingencies are particularly susceptible to significant\nchange in recorded amounts.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced\nany losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits with other financial\ninstitutions, and federal funds sold. Net cash flows are reported for customer loan and deposit transactions.\nTrust Assets\nProperty held for customers in a fiduciary capacity, other than trust cash on deposit at the Bank, is not included in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements since such items are not assets of the Company.\nSecurities\nSecurities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them until\nmaturity. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains\nand losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. Securities held for resale are classified as trading and are carried at fair\nvalue, with changes in unrealized holding gains and losses included in income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the\ntime of purchase. Securities with limited marketability, such as stock in the FRB and the FHLB are carried at cost. Securities not readily marketable are\ncarried at cost.\nInterest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are\ngenerally amortized on the interest method with a constant effective yield without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where\nprepayments are anticipated. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date. Gains and losses are recorded on the trade date and\ndetermined using the basis of the cost of specific securities sold.\nFactored Receivables\nIntegra, operating as a division of the Bank, purchases invoices on completed work from its factoring clients. Integra also makes, from time to time,\nshort-term advances to its clients on transportation contracts for upcoming loads or, to a much lesser extent, makes over-advances on the existing\npurchased invoices. Funds are advanced to the client based on the applicable advance rate, less fees, as agreed to in each individual factoring agreement.\nThe gross amount (face value) of the invoices purchased are recorded by Integra as factored receivables, and the unadvanced portions of the invoices\npurchased, less discount and origination fees, are considered deferred client reserves and recorded as other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets. The deferred client reserves are held to settle any payment disputes or collection short payments, and become reserves due to client\nwhen the receivables are collected. Reserves due to client may be used to pay clients’ obligations to various third parties as directed by the client, are\nperiodically withdrawn by clients, and are reported as deposits in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nUnearned factoring fees and unearned net origination fees are deferred revenue and recognized as interest income in the Company’s consolidated\nincome statements over the weighted average collection period for the entire portfolio of factored receivables. Subsequent factoring fees are recognized\nin interest income as incurred by the client and deducted from the clients’ reserve balances.\nOther factoring-related fees, which include ACH and wire transfer fees, fuel card funding fees, carrier payment fees, fuel advance fees, and other\nsimilar fees, are recognized as incurred and are reported by the Company as non-interest income.\n94\nTable of Contents\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans which are originated or purchased and are intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value\ndetermined on an aggregate basis. Valuation adjustments, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to non-interest income and\ndirect loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in non-interest income upon sale of the loan. Loans held\nfor sale are comprised of the guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans. The Company did not incur a lower of cost or market valuation provision in the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company elected to reclassify $52.6 million and $55.4 million of the SBA 7(a) loans held for sale to loans\nheld for investment during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoans\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance\noutstanding, net of unearned interest, unearned discount, deferred loan fees, and allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid\nprincipal balance. Discount on acquired loans and net loan origination fees are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method\nwithout anticipating prepayments.\nInterest income on commercial business and commercial real estate loans is discontinued when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent unless the\ncredit is well secured and in process of collection. Unsecured consumer loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes 90 days past due.\nConsumer loans secured by collateral other than real estate are charged off after a review of all factors affecting the ability to collect on the loan, including\nthe borrower’s history, overall financial condition, resources, guarantor support, and the realizable value of any collateral. However, any consumer loan\npast due 180 days is charged off. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off\nat an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is\naccounted for on a cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual basis. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the\nprincipal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”), effective on January 1, 2023. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss\nmethodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. The CECL model requires the measurement of all expected\ncredit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures based on historical experience, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in\nestimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13 permits the use of estimation\ntechniques that are practical and relevant to the Company’s circumstances, as long as they are applied consistently over time and faithfully estimate\nexpected credit losses in accordance with the standard. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available for sale debt securities. One\nsuch change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does\nnot intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required to sell. Management has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest\nreceivable on available for sale securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately in other assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet (“OBS”) credit exposures. Results for\nreporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023, are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with\npreviously applicable incurred loss model under GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses\nof $1.4 million which was recognized through a $1.1 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of\nthe allowance for credit losses to $5.9 million as of January 1, 2023. In addition, the Company recorded a $237,505 reserve on unfunded commitments\nwhich is recorded in other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and was recognized through a $188,000 adjustment to retained\nearnings, net of tax.\n95\nTable of Contents\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been\nrecognized prior to January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities.\nTherefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses for debt securities was not required.\nASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), eliminates\nthe accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings in ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables -Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while\nenhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nAdditionally, ASU 2022-02 requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net\ninvestments in leases within the scope of ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost. The Company\nadopted ASU 2022-02 on a modified retrospective basis effective on January 1, 2023. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAs further discussed below under “New Accounting Pronouncements” the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,\n“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” on January 1, 2023. Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) Topic 326 (“ASC 326”) replaces the previous “incurred loss” methodology with an “expected loss” methodology which\nencompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. The new current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model requires\nthe measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures based on\nhistorical experience, adjusted for qualitative factors and current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company adopted ASC 326\nusing the modified retrospective method for loans and OBS credit exposures.\nAllowance for credit losses – loans: In accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present management's best estimate of the net amount\nexpected to be collected. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that collectability\nof the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is increased (decreased) by provisions (or reversals\nof) reported in the income statement as a component of provision for credit losses. Management has made the accounting policy election to exclude\naccrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses and reports accrued interest separately in other assets in the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective on January 1, 2023. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss\nmethodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The new CECL model requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and OBS credit exposures. Results for reporting\nperiods beginning after January 1, 2023, are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with the\npreviously applicable incurred loss model under GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses\nof $1.4 million which was recognized through a $1.1 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of\nthe allowance for credit losses to $5.9 million as of January 1, 2023. In addition, the Company recorded a $237,505 reserve on unfunded commitments\nwhich is recorded in other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and was recognized through a $188,000 adjustment to retained\nearnings, net of tax.\nAllowance for credit losses - available for sale securities: For available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses\nwhether it intends to sell or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of\nthese criteria is met, the securities amortized cost basis is written down to fair value as a current period expense. If either of the above criteria is not met,\nthe Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management may\nconsider various factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency,\nperformance of any underlying collateral and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that\na credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security and any excess of the\namortized cost basis over the present value of expected cash flows is recorded as an allowance for credit loss, limited to the amount by which the fair\nvalue is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome as a non credit-related impairment.\n96\nTable of Contents\nThe Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors based upon our analysis of the underlying\nrisk characteristics, including credit ratings, such as bond ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and in\nconsideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash\nflows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount\nthat the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in\nother comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are\ncharged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or\nrequirement to sell is met.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Available for sale securities are charged-off\nagainst the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the\naforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nAllowance for credit losses - held to maturity securities: The allowance for credit losses on held to maturity securities is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from the amortized cost basis of held to maturity securities to present management's best estimate of the net amount expected to be collected.\nHeld to maturity securities are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Adjustments to the allowance are reported\nin the income statement as a component of provision for credit losses. Management measures expected credit losses on held to maturity securities on a\ncollective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts along with payment and delinquency history.\nManagement has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on available for sale and held to maturity securities from\nthe estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that were deemed\nto be other than temporary were reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses prior to January 1, 2023,\nmanagement considered, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value had been less than cost, (ii) the financial\ncondition and near-term prospects of the issuer and (iii) the intent and our ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to\nallow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures: The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability\naccount, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to\ncredit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation.\nThe allowance is reported as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in the income\nstatement as a component of provision for credit losses. Further information regarding Company policies and methodology used to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies.\nPremises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings and related components are depreciated\nusing the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 5 to 39 years. Furniture and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method with\nuseful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Land improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term or estimated life, whichever is shorter. Repair and maintenance\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nWe lease certain office facilities and office equipment under operating leases. We also own certain office facilities which we lease to outside parties\nunder operating lessor leases. Under the lease standards, for operating leases other than those considered to be short-term, we recognize lease right-of-\nuse assets and related lease liabilities. Such amounts are reported as components of other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheet. We do not recognize short-term operating leases on our balance sheet. A short-term operating lease has an original term of 12\nmonths or less and does not have a purchase option that is likely to be exercised.\n97\nTable of Contents\nIn recognizing lease right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities, we account for lease and non-lease components (such as taxes, insurance, and\ncommon area maintenance costs) separately as such amounts are generally readily determinable under our lease contracts. Lease payments over the\nexpected term are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate referenced to the Federal Home Loan Bank Secure Connect advance rates for\nborrowings of similar term. We also consider renewal and termination options in the determination of the term of the lease. If it is reasonably certain that a\nrenewal or termination option will be exercised, the effects of such options are included in the determination of the expected lease term. Generally, we\ncannot be reasonably certain about whether or not we will renew a lease until such time the lease is within the last two years of the existing lease term.\nHowever, renewal options related to our regional headquarters facilities or operations centers are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, typically in advance\nof such time frame. When we are reasonably certain that a renewal option will be exercised, we measure/remeasure the right-of-use asset and related lease\nliability using the lease payments specified for the renewal period or, if such amounts are unspecified, we generally assume an increase (evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis in light of prevailing market conditions) in the lease payment over the final period of the existing lease term.\nForeclosed Assets\nAssets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs when\nacquired, establishing a new cost basis. Costs after acquisition are generally expensed. If the fair value of the asset declines, a write-down is recorded\nthrough expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic\nconditions. The Company had no foreclosed assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 reported in other real estate in the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets.\nServicing Rights\nThe guaranteed portion of certain SBA and USDA loans can be sold into the secondary market. Servicing rights are recognized as separate assets\nwhen loans are sold with servicing retained. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated future net servicing income.\nThe Company uses industry prepayment statistics in estimating the expected life of the loans. Management evaluates its servicing rights for impairment\nquarterly. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Fair value is determined\nusing discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and aggregated by predominant risk characteristics. The initial servicing rights and\nresulting gain on sale are calculated based on the difference between the actual par and bids on an individual loan basis.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets\nacquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as\ndetermined by valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 58 to 100 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not\namortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. The\nCompany performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles during 2023 and 2022, as required by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles\n—Goodwill and Other. The 2023 and 2022 tests indicated no impairment of the Company’s goodwill or core deposit intangibles.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company has a share-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 11. The Company accounts for it stock-based\ncompensation in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for share-based payments. This guidance requires all share-based payments to be\nrecognized on the consolidated statements of income based on their fair values. Compensation costs for awards with graded vesting are recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the vesting period.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs totaled $558,000 and $475,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and are included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income.\n98\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized\nfor future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized\nin income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with current accounting guidance which prescribes a recognition threshold\nand a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nBenefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained\nupon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-\nthan-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of cumulative benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon\nultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first\nsubsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. No uncertain tax\npositions have been recognized.\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return with our subsidiaries. Federal income tax expense or benefit has been allocated to subsidiaries\non a separate return basis.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes net unrealized\ngains and losses on available for sale securities, which are recognized as a separate component of equity. Comprehensive income for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nTransfer of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is\ndeemed to be surrendered when (i) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (ii) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain\nit from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (iii) the Company does not maintain effective control over the\ntransferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. Transfer of financial assets are comprised of the guaranteed portion of\nSBA and USDA loans which have been sold.\nLoss Contingencies\nLoss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of\nloss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 16. Fair\nvalue estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in\nthe absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Topic 606 establishes\nprinciples for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to\nprovide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\n99\nTable of Contents\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenue from loan and investment income which are specifically excluded from the scope of this standard. Of\nthe Company’s remaining sources of income, substantially all sources of banking revenue are recognized either by transaction (ATM, interchange, wire\ntransfer, etc.) or when the Company charges a customer for a service that has already been rendered (monthly service charges, account fees, monthly\ntrust management fees, monthly premise rental income, etc.). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance\nobligations are satisfied. Other non-interest income primarily includes items such as gains on the sale of loans held for sale and servicing fees, none of\nwhich are subject to the requirements of Topic 606.\nThe scope of ASC 606 focuses on revenue from contracts with customers, which includes fees from asset management services and commission\nincome and fees and commissions from investment banking services, as well as fees earned by the Bank’s Nolan division for their third party\nadministration services. These items make up the majority of the non-interest income on our income statement. Under Topic 606, the recognition and\nmeasurement of revenue is based on the assessment of individual contract terms. Significant judgment is required to determine whether performance\nobligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time; how to allocate transaction prices where multiple performance obligations are identified; when to\nrecognize revenue based on the appropriate measure of the Company’s progress under the related agreement; and whether constraints on variable\nconsideration should be applied due to uncertain future events.\nAdvisory Fees\nInvestment advisory fees: The Company provides investment advisory services on a daily basis. The Company believes the performance obligation\nfor providing advisory services is satisfied over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the\nCompany. For the majority of accounts, fee arrangements are based on a percentage applied to the customer’s assets under management. Fees calculated\nin this manner are generally received monthly or quarterly and are recognized as revenue ratably over the period as they relate specifically to the services\nprovided in that period, which are distinct from the services provided in other periods.\nPerformance fees: The Company receives fees under certain of its agreements which vary based on specified performance measures, for example,\nwhen a separate account exceeds a specified benchmark or contractual hurdle over a contractual performance period. These performance fees may be paid\nin addition to standard investment advisory fees. Currently, most of the Company’s contracts of this nature specify an annual performance period. These\nfees are earned once account returns have exceeded these specified performance measures for the performance period, and are calculated as a percentage\nof account returns. These performance fees are considered variable consideration as the uncertainty is dependent on the value of the assets at future\npoints in time as well as meeting a specified hurdle rate, both of which are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence. Revenues are\nrecognized in the last period of the performance period specified in the respective contract since this is the point at which the Company can conclude that\na significant reversal will not occur.\nOther advisory fees: The Company provides general advisory services on an ongoing basis, which may include: operational advice, advice to\nmanagement on strategic and other initiatives and/or advice on prospective mergers and acquisitions. Revenue is recognized over time for these advisory\narrangements, given that under the relevant agreements, the performance obligations are simultaneously provided by the Company and consumed by the\ncustomer.\nCommissions\nBrokerage commissions: The Company buys and sells securities on behalf of its customers through its arrangements with its clearing firm. Each time\na customer enters into a buy or sell transaction, the Company charges a commission. Commissions and clearing expenses are recorded each month based\nupon the trade date, which is the date that the Company fills the trade order by finding and contracting with a counterparty and confirms the trade with\nthe customer. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial\ninstrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer.\nSyndication and private placement commissions: The Company participates in the syndication of public securities offerings and in private\nplacement offerings for business entities that want to raise funds through a sale of securities. With respect to public securities offerings, the Company\nmay make a commitment to acquire securities from the issuer, or the Company may participate in the syndication group on a best efforts, non-committed\nbasis. With respect to private placement offerings, the performance obligation is the consummation of the sale of securities of the issuer, typically on a\n“best efforts” basis. Revenues are earned from fees arising from these securities offerings, and are recognized when the performance obligation is\nsatisfied, generally the trade date. The Company believes that the trade date is the appropriate point in time to recognize revenue for these securities\ntransactions as there are no significant actions which the Company needs to take subsequent to this date and the issuer obtains the control and benefit\nof the capital markets offering at that point.\n100\nTable of Contents\nAccounting Changes, Reclassifications and Restatements\nCertain items in prior financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation but have no effect on the reported results of\noperations.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share is\ncomputed using the weighted-average shares and all potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth the\ncomputation of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the following periods:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 13,667 $ 15,478\nWeighted average shares outstanding 7,057 7,062\nEffect of dilutive shares 236 274\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding 7,293 7,336\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.94 $ 2.19\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.87 $ 2.11\nAs of December 31, 2023, options to purchase 167,500 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $5.51, were included in the\ncomputation of diluted net earnings per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, 170,000 shares of restricted stock grants with a grant date fair value of\n$4.81 per share which vest from 2023 through 2025 were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.\nNote 2.

These investment contracts or bonds located in Texas, California and Florida, originate under a contractual obligation between\nthe property owners, the local county or city administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. PACE assessments are created to fund the\npurchase and installation of energy saving improvements to the property such as solar panels. PID/TIRZ assessments are used to pay for the\ndevelopment costs of a residential subdivision. Generally, as a property assessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32\nyears by the then current property owner(s). Each installment is collected by the County or City Tax Collector where the property is located. The\nassessments are an obligation of the property. Securities, restricted consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (“FRB”) and Federal Home Loan Bank of\nDallas (“FHLB”) stock, which are carried at cost.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, securities available for sale with a fair value of $988,000 and $94,000, respectively, were pledged against trust\ndeposit balances held at the Bank. During March 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) created the Bank\nTerm Funding Program (“BTFP”), which was made available to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system. The BTFP\nallows the whole par value of available for sale securities to be included as the collateral value. As of December 31, 2023, securities with a par value of\n$23.3 million were pledged to the Federal Reserve under the BTFP, which $21.0 million was borrowed against. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there\nwere no securities pledged to secure borrowings at the FHLB.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank held FRB stock in the amount of $2.2 million. The Bank held FHLB stock in the amount of $2.0 million\nand $1.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, all of which were classified as restricted securities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company held an income interest in a private investment, which was not readily marketable, accounted for under the\ncost less impairment method in the amount $100,000. The interest terminated under the terms of the private investment during the last quarter of 2023, and\nthe Company recorded a $100,000 loss on disposition of securities not readily marketable. No allowance for impairment was recorded during 2023 or 2022.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe table below indicates the length of time individual investment securities have been in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2023:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(In thousands) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ 988 $ 3 $ 990 $ 9 $ 1,978 $ 12\nU.S. government agencies - - 13,627 2,017 13,627 2,017\nMortgage-backed securities 1,022 4 4,434 271 5,456 275\nTotal $ 2,010 $ 7 $ 19,051 $ 2,297 $ 21,061 $ 2,304\nBeginning January 1, 2023, the Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any debt securities in a loss position require an allowance\nfor credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company had a total of twenty-three (23) investment positions in the unrealized loss position as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available for sale and held to maturity securities in an unrealized loss\nposition as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the\nunderlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our securities and in consideration of our historical credit\nloss experience and internal forecasts, along with current payment history and no delinquent payments as of December 31, 2023. The issuers of these\nsecurities are U.S. government agencies who continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities.\nFurthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale in the table above and believes that it is\nmore likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market\ninterest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased.

The Bank believes that these loans are to credit\nworthy borrowers and are diversified geographically.\nAccrued interest receivable on loans totaled $3.1 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in other assets\nin the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company serves the small business community by offering loans promulgated under the SBA’s 7(a) and 504 loan programs, and loans\nguaranteed by the USDA. SBA 7(a) and USDA loans are typically guaranteed by each agency in amounts ranging from 75% to 80% of the principal\nbalance. For SBA construction loans, the Company records the guaranteed funded portion of the loans as held for sale. When the SBA loans are fully\nfunded, the Company may sell the guaranteed portion into the secondary market, on a servicing-retained basis, or reclassify from loans held for sale to\nloans held for investment if the Company determines that holding these loans provide better long-term risk adjusted returns than selling the loans. In\ncalculating gain on the sale of loans, the Company performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portion of the\nloan. The Company’s assumptions are validated by reference to external market information.\nThe Company had $26.6 million and $33.9 million of SBA/USDA loans held for sale as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The\nCompany sold the guaranteed portion of one USDA loan totaling $5.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale loans of $581,000 for the year ended December\n31, 2023. There were no loans sold for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company elected to reclassify $52.6 million and $55.4 million, respectively,\nof the SBA 7(a) loans held for sale to loans held for investment during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLoan Origination/Risk Management.\nThe Company maintains written loan origination policies, procedures, and processes which address credit quality at several levels including\nindividual loan level, loan type, and loan portfolio levels.\nCommercial and industrial loans, which are predominantly loans to dentists, are underwritten based on historical and projected income of the\nbusiness and individual borrowers and guarantors. The Company utilizes a comprehensive global debt service coverage analysis to determine debt\nservice coverage ratios. This analysis compares global cash flow of the borrowers and guarantors on an individual credit to existing and proposed debt\nafter consideration of personal and business related other expenses. Collateral is generally a lien on all available assets of the business borrower\nincluding intangible assets. Credit worthiness of individual borrowers and guarantors is established through the use of credit reports and credit scores.\nConsumer loans are evaluated on the basis of credit worthiness as established through the use of credit reports and credit scores. Additional credit\nquality indicators include borrower debt to income ratios based on verifiable income sources.\n104\nTable of Contents\nReal estate mortgage loans are evaluated based on collateral value as well as global debt service coverage ratios based on historical and projected\nincome from all related sources including the collateral property, the borrower, and all guarantors where applicable.\nThe Company originates SBA loans which are sometimes sold into the secondary market. The Company continues to service these loans after sale\nand is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts. The two primary SBA loan programs that the Company offers are the basic 7(a) loan\nguaranty program and the 504 loan program in conjunction with junior lien financing from a Certified Development Company (“CDC”). The SBA has\ndesignated the Bank as a “Preferred Lender.” As an SBA Preferred Lender, the Bank has been delegated loan approval, closing and most servicing and\nliquidation authority from the SBA.\nThe 7(a) program serves as the SBA’s primary business loan program to help qualified small businesses obtain financing when they might not be\neligible for business loans through normal lending channels. Loan proceeds under this program can be used for most business purposes including\nworking capital, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, land and building (including purchase, renovation and new construction), leasehold\nimprovements and debt refinancing. Loan maturity is generally up to 10 years for non-real estate collateral and up to 25 years for real estate collateral. The\n7(a) loan is approved and funded by a qualified lender, partially guaranteed by the SBA and subject to applicable regulations. In general, the SBA\nguarantees up to 75% of the loan amount depending on loan size. The Company is required by the SBA to service the loan and retain a contractual\nminimum of 5% on all SBA 7(a) loans, but generally retains 25% (the unguaranteed portion). The servicing spread is 1% of the guaranteed portion of the\nloan that is sold in the secondary market.\nThe 504 program is an economic development-financing program providing long-term, low down payment loans to businesses. Typically, a 504\nproject includes a loan secured from a private-sector lender with a senior lien, a loan secured from a CDC (funded by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture)\nwith a junior lien covering up to 40% of the total cost, and a contribution of at least 10% equity from the borrower. Debenture limits are $5.0 million for\nregular 504 loans and $5.5 million for those 504 loans that meet a public policy goal.\nThe Company also offers Business & Industry (“B&I”) program loans through the USDA. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they\nare guaranteed by the USDA. The guaranteed amount is generally 80%. B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally\nlarger loans to larger businesses than the SBA 7(a) loans. Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market. These loans can be\nutilized for rural commercial real estate and equipment. The loans can have maturities up to 30 years and the rates can be fixed or variable.\nConstruction and land development loans are evaluated based on the borrower’s and guarantor’s credit worthiness, past experience in the industry,\ntrack record and experience with the type of project being considered, and other factors. Collateral value is determined generally by independent appraisal\nutilizing multiple approaches to determine value based on property type.\nThe Bank engages in third-party factoring of certain business’ accounts receivable invoices. The Bank’s factoring clients are primarily in the\ntransportation industry. Each account debtor is credit qualified, confirming credit worthiness and stability, because the underlying debtor represents the\nsubstantive underlying credit risk. Some factored receivables are full recourse to and personally guaranteed by the factoring client. In such cases, the\nclient is credit qualified under specific policy guidelines. Concentration limits are set and monitored for aggregate factored receivables, account debtors,\nand individual factoring clients. In addition, we consider the overall state of each specific industry, primarily over-the-road trucking, in our evaluation of\nthe credit worthiness of the factoring client and the underlying debtor.\nFor all loan types, the Company establishes guidelines for its underwriting criteria including collateral coverage ratios, global debt service coverage\nratios, and maximum amortization or loan maturity terms.\nAt the portfolio level, the Company monitors concentrations of loans based on several criteria including loan type, collateral type, industry,\ngeography, and other factors. The Company also performs periodic market research and economic analysis at a local geographic and national level. Based\non this research, the Company may from time to time change the minimum or benchmark underwriting criteria applied to the above loan types.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become\ndue, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are\nconsidered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the\nprincipal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured,\nwhich is typically evidenced by a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower.\n105\nTable of Contents\nYear-end non-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNon-Accrual\nTotal with No Credit Total\n(In thousands) Non-Accrual Loss Allowance Non-Accrual\nReal estate - commercial $ 221 $ 221 $ 138\nSBA guaranteed 1,951 1,951 2,221\nSBA unguaranteed 251 251 107\nTotal $ 2,423 $ 2,423 $ 2,466\nThe Company recognized $19,000 of interest income on non-accrual loans during the year ended December 31, 2023, and did not recognize any\ninterest income on non-accrual loans during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFrom time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result\nin new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of a principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a combination thereof, among other things. As of December 31, 2023, the period-end\nbalance of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty included a SBA loan with an outstanding balance of $1.1 million to temporarily\nreduce the interest rate and a SBA loan with an outstanding balance of $2.4 million to temporarily lower the monthly payment amounts. These loans were\ncurrent as of December 31, 2023, and there were no commitments to lend additional funds to these borrowers at December 31, 2023.\nUnder ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net\namount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. The\nCompany’s allowance for credit losses for loans consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically\nidentified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical credit loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk\nfactors both internal and external to the Company.\nThe Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected\nin order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. In setting the\nspecific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to\neach loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans, which along with the delinquency list of loans,\nhelps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified\nas impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company\nallocates a specific reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the loan or when the discounted cash flows for the loan is lower than\nthe carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit\nlosses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the\nsale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis.\nIn determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical lifetime credit loss experience,\nconcentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company’s loan portfolio, current economic conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower’s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the\nCompany’s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and\nexternal to the Company and other relevant factors in accordance with ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.” Historical lifetime credit\nloss experience is determined by utilizing an open-pool (“cumulative loss rate”) methodology. Adjustments to the historical lifetime credit loss experience\nare made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations, delinquency, non-accrual, and watch list levels, as well\nas changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates, property and collateral values, and other indices relating to\neconomic activity. The utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates. For all loan\npools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over two years\non a straight-line basis. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance\nof each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not\npreclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.\n106\nTable of Contents\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit\nlosses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans by class of loans as of December 31, 2023:\nResidential Real\n(In thousands) Estate\nReal estate – residential $ 221\nSBA unguaranteed 251\nTotal $ 472\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 326, loans were considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will be\nunable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest\npayments. If a loan is impaired, a specific valuation allowance was allocated, if necessary, so that the loan was reported net, at the present value of\nestimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Interest\npayments on impaired loans are typically applied to principal unless collectability of the principal amount is reasonably assured, in which case interest is\nrecognized on a cash basis. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.\nThe Company’s impaired loans and related allowance is summarized in the following table as of December 31, 2022:\nUnpaid Recorded Recorded\nContractual Investment Investment Total Average Interest\nPrincipal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Income\n(In thousands) Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment Recognized\nYear Ended December\n31, 2022\nCommercial and industrial $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 181 $ -\nSBA 2,759 2,126 - 2,126 - 2,287 -\nTotal $ 2,759 $ 2,126 $ - $ 2,126 $ - $ 2,468 $ -\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due.

Loans are graded in one of six categories: (i) pass, (ii)\npass-watch, (iii) special mention, (iv) substandard, (v) doubtful, or (vi) loss. Loans graded as loss are charged-off.\nThe classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. The Company reviews the ratings on\ncredits quarterly. No significant changes were made to the loan risk grading system definitions and allowance for credit loss methodology during the past\nyear. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be inherent in each credit. The Company’s methodology is structured so that\nspecific allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in\naccordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss).\nCredits rated pass are acceptable loans, appropriately underwritten, bearing an ordinary risk of loss to the Company. Loans in this category are loans\nto highly credit worthy borrowers with financial statements presenting a good primary source as well as an adequate secondary source of repayment.\nCredits rated pass-watch loans have been determined to require enhanced monitoring for potential weaknesses which require further investigation.\nThey have no significant delinquency in the past twelve months. This rating causes the loan to be actively monitored with greater frequency than pass\nloans and allows appropriate downgrade transition if verifiable adverse events are confirmed. This category may also include loans that have improved in\ncredit quality from special mention but are not yet considered pass loans.\nCredits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness; however, such concerns are not so\npronounced that the Company generally expects to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform\nwithin standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits rated more harshly.\nCredits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse\ntrends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these\ncredits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to strengthen the Company’s position, and/or to reduce exposure and to\nassure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the\nsecondary support to the credit is performed. Guaranteed portions of SBA loans graded substandard are generally on non-accrual due to the limited\namount of interest covered by the guarantee, usually 60 days maximum. However, there typically will be no exposure to loss on the principal amount of\nthese guaranteed portions of the loan.\nCredits rated doubtful are those in which full collection of principal appears highly questionable, and which some degree of loss is anticipated, even\nthough the ultimate amount of loss may not yet be certain and/or other factors exist which could affect collection of debt. Based upon available\ninformation, positive action by the Company is required to avert or minimize loss.\nLoans classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This\nclassification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off\nthis asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of loans by year of origination, internal ratings, and gross write-offs by year of origination\nas of December 31, 2023:\nTerm Loans by Origination Year\nRevolving\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans Total\nCommercial and industrial\nPass $ 14,632 $ 23,938 $ 16,625 $ 7,769 $ 5,229 $ 9,289 $ 1,847 $ 79,329\nPass-watch -

In assessing the realization rate of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more\nlikely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance for deferred tax\nassets was recorded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized\nagainst deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income.\nNote 11. Stock Compensation Plans\nThe board of directors and shareholders adopted the Amended and Restated Tectonic Financial, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“Plan”). The Plan\nis administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors and authorizes the granting of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants in order to promote the success of the Company’s business. Incentive stock\noptions may be granted only to employees of the Company, or a parent or subsidiary of the Company. The Company reserved 750,000 authorized shares\nof common stock for the Plan. The term of each option is no longer than 10 years from the date of the grant. At December 31, 2023, the Company had\n340,000 shares of common stock remaining available for future grants.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation plans using the fair value-based method of accounting. The fair value of each\noption award is estimated on the date of grant by a third party using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model. The fair value of each grant\naward is estimated on the date of grant by a third party using the market approach based on the application of latest 12-month Company metrics to\nguideline public company multiples.\nOn September 27, 2021, 40,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company with an exercise price of $10.00 and an intrinsic value of $6.92 were granted\nwith a contract life through December 31, 2021. Sanders Morris issued a full recourse secured promissory note at the time of the grant. These shares of\nrestricted stock vested immediately, and were exercised on October 29, 2021, with the grantees utilizing the proceeds of the promissory note from Sanders\nMorris to fund the exercise price. This note receivable is recognized within a contra-equity account, with payments by the grantees reducing this balance\nas they occur. Once exercised, the shares were subject to a right of repurchase by the Company under certain circumstances which right expired on\nDecember 31, 2023.\nNo stock options were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, options on 22,500 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock were exercised at $4.30 per share for a total exercise price of $96,750. There were no stock options granted or forfeited during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nThe number of option shares outstanding was 167,500 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the weighted average exercise price was $5.51. The\nweighted average contractual life of the stock awards as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 3.37 years and 4.37 years, respectively. Stock options\noutstanding at the end of the period had immaterial aggregate intrinsic values. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.98. Under Topic 805, the grant date fair value has been restated as though the Tectonic Merger, under which Tectonic Holdings,\nLLC merged with and into Tectonic Financial, Inc., had occurred upon the date at which the entities came under common control.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all 167,500 stock options outstanding were vested, and there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost. The\nCompany recorded compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, and for the 40,000 shares of restricted stock granted\nSeptember 27, 2021, over the right of repurchase period. The Company recorded salaries and employee benefits expense on our consolidated statements\nof income in connection with the options issued and restricted stock issued under the plan of $81,000 and $78,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company granted restricted stock units totaling 210,000 shares of common stock. The fair value of each unit award was\nestimated on the date of grant by a third party using the market approach based on the application of latest 12-month Company metrics to guideline\npublic company multiples. The vesting schedules vary by award, with all of the units awarded vesting over a three year period from 2023 through 2025.\nThe restricted stock units are subject to accelerated vesting due to death, total disability, or change in control of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 78,000 awarded units of restricted stock were outstanding, and the grant date fair value was $4.81. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 92,000 units awarded became vested and shares were issued. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 10,000 units awarded became\nvested and shares were issued, and 30,000 restricted stock units were forfeited with a grant date fair value of $4.81 per share. The weighted average\ncontractual life as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 1.18 years and 1.54 years, respectively. The Company is recording compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the respective vesting periods. There was a $78,000 reversal in compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwhich was related to the forfeiture of 30,000 unvested restricted stock awards. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded\nsalaries and employee benefits expense on our consolidated statements of income of $221,000 and $193,000, respectively, related to the restricted stock\nawards. As of December 31, 2023, there was $98,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 78,000 and 170,000 restricted units awarded were outstanding, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair\nvalue of the awards as of December 31, 2023, was $4.81.\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the\nevent of non-performance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by\nthe contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does\nfor on-balance sheet instruments.\n116\nTable of Contents\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe following table summarizes loan commitments:\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 2022\nUndisbursed loan commitments $ 45,743 $ 43,427\nStandby letters of credit 162 161\n$ 45,905 $ 43,588\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a\nliability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to\ncredit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation.\nOff-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in the table\nabove. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur, and the amount expected to\nbe funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are\nbased on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments\nexpected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same\nmethodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded.\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet commitments.\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ - $ -\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 238 -\nProvision for off-balance sheet credit exposure (45) -\nEnding balance $ 193 $ -\nThe Company is involved in various regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to\ntime in the ordinary course of business. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that\nan unfavorable resolution of these matters, will adversely affect the Company, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The\nCompany’s regular practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal matters, and to accrue for liabilities when payment is\nprobable.\nThe Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sanders Morris, has uncommitted financing arrangements with clearing brokers that finance its\ncustomer accounts, certain broker-dealer balances, and firm trading positions. Although these customer accounts and broker-dealer balances are not\nreflected on the consolidated balance sheets for financial reporting purposes, Sanders Morris has generally agreed to indemnify these clearing brokers for\nlosses they may sustain in connection with the accounts, and therefore, retains risk on these accounts. Sanders Morris is required to maintain certain\ncash or securities on deposit with its clearing brokers. Deposits with clearing organizations were $250,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company is party to amended and restated employment agreements with Patrick Howard, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company,\nand Ken Bramlage, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In addition, the Company entered into an employment agreement\nwith A. Haag Sherman, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, in connection with the Company’s merger with Tectonic Holdings and its initial public\noffering. Messrs. Sherman and Howard’s employment agreements had a four year term and now is year to year, and Mr. Bramlage’s employment\nagreement had a three year term and now is year to year.\n117\nTable of Contents\nNote 13. Related Parties\nAdvisors’ service agreements: In January 2006, the Company entered into a services agreement (the “Tectonic Advisors-CWA Services\nAgreement”) with Cain Watters. The owners of Cain Watters together hold approximately 29.5% ownership in the Company. Under the Tectonic\nAdvisors-CWA Services Agreement, Cain Watters pays the Company for due diligence and research services on investment alternatives available to Cain\nWatters’ clients. The Company earned $257,000 and $291,000 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, under the Tectonic\nAdvisors-CWA Services Agreement. These fees are included in investment advisory and other related services in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of income. The Company had $95,000 in fees payable and $21,000 in fees receivable, respectively, related to these services at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in other liabilities and other assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCWA Fee Allocation Agreement: In January 2006, Tectonic Advisors entered into an agreement (the “Fee Allocation Agreement”) with Cain\nWatters with reference to its advisory agreement with the Bank. Tectonic Advisors had $215,000 and $193,000 payable to Cain Watters related to this\nagreement at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain officers, directors and their affiliated companies had depository accounts with the Bank as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaling\napproximately $7.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively. None of those deposit accounts have terms more favorable than those available to any other\ndepositor. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no loans outstanding to directors of the Bank or their affiliated companies.\nNote 14. Regulatory Matters\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material effect on the Bank’s and, accordingly, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of\nthe Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under GAAP, regulatory reporting requirements, and regulatory capital\nstandards. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings\nand other factors. Furthermore, the Bank’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in these financial statements.\nQuantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and\nratios (set forth in the table below) of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital to total risk-weighted assets,\nand of tier 1 capital to average assets. To be categorized as “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework, the Bank must maintain (i) a\nTotal risk-based capital ratio of 10%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%; and (iv) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of\n6.5%.\nIn addition, the Basel III regulatory capital reforms (“Basel III”) implemented a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The Basel III minimum capital\nratio requirements as applicable to the Bank are summarized in the table below.\nBASEL III\nMinimum for BASEL III\nCapital Additional Capital BASEL III Ratio with\nAdequacy Conservation Capital Conservation\nRequirements Buffer Buffer\nTotal Risk Based Capital (total capital to risk weighted assets) 8.0% 2.5% 10.5%\nTier 1 Risk Based Capital (tier 1 to risk weighted assets) 6.0% 2.5% 8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk Based ( CET1 to risk weighted assets) 4.5% 2.5% 7.0%\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio (tier 1 to average assets) 4.0% -% 4.0%\nAccordingly, a financial institution may be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework, but not satisfy the Basel III\ncapital ratios. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios are in excess of the capital conservation buffer and the levels established for\n“well capitalized” institutions under the Basel III rules.\n118\nTable of Contents\nThe regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank are as follows:\nMinimum Capital Required - Required to be Considered\nActual Basel III Well Capitalized\n(In thousands, except percentages) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets)\nTectonic Financial, Inc.

Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the\neffect of dividends declared (including those on the Series A preferred stock) would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank and/or the Company to fall\nbelow specified minimum levels. Approval is also required if dividends declared exceed the net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits\nfor the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $16.6 million was available for the declaration of dividends by the Bank to the\nCompany without prior approval of regulatory agencies and still maintain its “well capitalized” status. In addition, as a Texas corporation, we are restricted\nunder the Texas Business Organizations Code from paying dividends under certain conditions. Under Texas law, we cannot pay dividends to\nshareholders if the dividends exceed our surplus or if after giving effect to the dividends, we would be insolvent.\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the regulatory\nframework applicable to registered investment advisors under the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, and additionally, Sanders Morris is\nregulated by FINRA, which, among other requirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital.\nNote 15. Operating Segments\nThe Company’s reportable segments consist of Banking, Other Financial Services, and HoldCo operations.\nThe Banking segment consists of operations relative to the Company’s full service banking operations, including providing depository and lending\nservices to individual and business customers, and other related banking services, as well as operations of the Bank’s Integra factoring division.\nThe Other Financial Services segment includes managed and directed brokerage, investment advisory services, including related trust company\noperations, third party administration, and insurance brokerage services to both individuals and businesses.\n119\nTable of Contents\nThe HoldCo operations include the operations and subordinated debt held at the Bank’s immediate parent, as well as the activities of the financial\nholding company which serves as T Bancshares’s parent.\nThe tables below present the financial information for each segment that is specifically identifiable, or based on allocations using internal methods,\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 46,467 $ - $ - $ 46,467\nTotal interest expense 17,909 - 1,197 19,106\nProvision for credit losses 1,288 - - 1,288\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 27,270 - (1,197) 26,073\nNon-interest income 2,050 37,854 (100) 39,804\nDepreciation and amortization expense 403 52 2 457\nAll other non-interest expense 16,997 25,529 3,838 46,364\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 11,920 $ 12,273 $ (5,137) $ 19,056\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,449 $ 2,350 $ - $ 21,799\nTotal assets $ 663,001 $ 12,661 $ 1,684 $ 677,346\nOther\nFinancial\n(In thousands) Banking Services HoldCo Consolidated\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nIncome Statement\nTotal interest income $ 33,385 $ - $ - $ 33,385\nTotal interest expense 4,993 - 911 5,904\nProvision for credit losses 1,264 - - 1,264\nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses 27,128 - (911) 26,217\nNon-interest income 1,238 38,788 14 40,040\nDepreciation and amortization expense 381 55 - 436\nAll other non-interest expense 14,879 27,569 1,921 44,369\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 13,106 $ 11,164 $ (2,818) $ 21,452\nGoodwill and other intangibles $ 19,659 $ 2,350 $ - $ 22,009\nTotal assets $ 599,305 $ 12,316 $ 915 $ 612,536\nNote 16. Fair Value of Financials Instruments\nThe fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction\noccurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. In estimating fair value, the\nCompany utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. Such valuation\ntechniques are consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n● Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at\nthe measurement date.\n● Level 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nThese might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in\nmarkets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.\n● Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\n120\nTable of Contents\nWhere quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market\nprices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing\nservices and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves,\ninterest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation\nhierarchy. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company has no\nsecurities in the Level 1 or Level 3 inputs.\nThe following table summarizes securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated by the level of the valuation\ninputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In thousands) Inputs Inputs Inputs Fair Value\nAs of December 31, 2023\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasuries $ - $ 3,894 $ - $ 3,894\nU.S. government agencies - 13,627 - 13,627\nMortgage-backed securities - 5,456 - 5,456\nAs of December 31, 2022\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. government agencies $ - $ 1,953 $ - $ 1,953\nU.S. government agencies - 13,088 - 13,088\nMortgage-backed securities - 5,592 - 5,592\nMarket valuations of our investment securities which are classified as Level 2 are provided by an independent third party. The fair values are\ndetermined by using several sources for valuing fixed income securities. Their techniques include pricing models that vary based on the type of asset\nbeing valued and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, the market valuation sources\ninclude observable market inputs and are therefore considered Level 2 inputs for purposes of determining the fair values.\nThe Company considers transfers between the levels of the hierarchy to be recognized at the end of related reporting periods. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, no assets for which fair value is measured on a recurring basis transferred between any levels of the hierarchy.\nCertain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair\nvalue on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\nFinancial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the reported periods include impaired loans and loans held for sale.\nImpaired loans. As of December 31, 2022, there were no impaired loans that were reduced by specific valuation allowances.\nThe significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent impaired loans primarily relate\nto the specialized discounting criteria applied to the borrower’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount depends upon the\ncondition and marketability of the collateral, as well as other factors which may affect the collectability of the loan. As the Company’s primary objective in\nthe event of default would be to liquidate the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, collateral that is less marketable would receive a\nlarger discount. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no discounts for collateral-dependent impaired loans.\nThe valuation of our not readily marketable investment securities which are classified as Level 3 are based on the Company’s own assumptions and\ninputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement, and are unobservable.\nOur assessment of the significance of a particular input to the Level 3 fair value measurements in their entirety requires judgment and considers\nfactors specific to the assets. It is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated fair value for instruments measured using Level 3 inputs could occur\nin the future.\n121\nTable of Contents\nLoans held for sale. Loans held for sale include the guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans and are reported at the lower of cost or estimated\nfair value. Fair value for SBA and USDA loans is based on market indications available in the market. There were no impairments reported for the periods\npresented.\nNon-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the reported periods include other real estate owned which, upon initial\nrecognition, was re-measured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, foreclosed assets which,\nsubsequent to their initial recognition, are re-measured at fair value through a write-down included in other non-interest expense. Regulatory guidelines\nrequire the Company to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. The fair value of foreclosed assets, upon initial\nrecognition and impairment, are re-measured using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data. Estimated fair value of other real estate is based on\nappraisals. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no\nforeclosed assets. There were no foreclosed assets re-measured during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value\non a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are described as follows:\nCarrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, restricted securities, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest\npayable. The estimated fair value of demand and savings deposits is the carrying amount since rates are regularly adjusted to market rates and amounts\nare payable on demand. For borrowed funds and variable rate loans or deposits that re-price frequently and fully, the estimated fair value is the carrying\namount. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent re-pricing, fair value is based on discounted cash flows\nusing current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. For loans held for sale, the estimated fair value is based on market indications for\nsimilar assets in the active market. The estimated fair value of other financial instruments and off-balance-sheet loan commitments approximate cost and\nare not considered significant to this presentation.\nThe Company adds a servicing asset when loans are sold and the servicing is retained, and uses the amortization method for the treatment of the\nservicing asset. The servicing asset is carried at lower of cost or fair value. Loan servicing assets do not trade in an active, open market with readily\nobservable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model having significant inputs of discount rate, prepayment speed\nand default rate. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. During the year ended December\n31, 2023, the Company added servicing assets totaling $38,000 in connection with the sale of a $5.8 million USDA loan. There was no sale of loans during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company amortized $56,000 and $168,000, respectively, using the\namortization method for the treatment of servicing loans. The Company reversed $35,000 of the servicing assets allowance for the year ended December\n31, 2023, and recorded an allowance provision of $10,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial\nassets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The estimated fair value\napproximates carrying value for cash and cash equivalents and accrued interest. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities that\nare not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis are discussed below:\nSecurities held to maturity. The securities in this category are PACE and PID/TIRZ investments. These investment contracts or bonds originate\nunder a contractual obligation between the property owners, the local county administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. The fair value\nof these investments are estimated using observable market inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis.\nLoans. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit\nrisk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the\ncurrent interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality.\nDeposits. The fair values of demand deposits, savings deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand and, therefore,\napproximate their carrying amounts. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that utilizes interest rates\ncurrently being offered on time deposits with similar contractual maturities.\n122\nTable of Contents\nBorrowed Funds. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for short-term borrowings. The fair value of long-term fixed-rate borrowings\nis estimated using quoted market prices, if available, or by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments. The\nestimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that reprice quarterly.\nLoan Commitments, Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit. Our lending commitments have variable interest rates and “escape” clauses if the\ncustomer’s credit quality deteriorates.

Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, “Disclosure Controls”) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Our\nmanagement, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls will prevent all error and\nall fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that\njudgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls also\nis based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving\nits stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nBased on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by\nthis Form 10-K, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial\nreporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that\npermit the Company to provide only management’s report in this Form 10-K.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting system is designed to provide reasonable assurance\nto management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of published financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for\neffective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nWhitley Penn LLP, Dallas, Texas, (U.S. PCAOB Auditor Firm I.D.: 726) an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Their report is\nincluded in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” This Annual Report on Form 10‑K does not include an attestation report of the\nCompany’s registered public accounting firm on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting due to the Company’s status as a Smaller\nReporting Company.\n126\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the\nquarter ended December 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting. The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There\ncan be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of the directors or officers of the Company adopted or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement\" or a \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,\" as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C.

Our board of directors believes the executive compensation packages that we provide to our executives, including the named\nexecutive officers, should reward performance. Each element of compensation is designed to achieve a specific purpose and to contribute to a total\npackage that is competitive with similar packages provided by other institutions that compete for the services of individuals like our named executive\nofficers.\nBase Salary\nWe provide each of our named executive officers with a competitive fixed annual base salary. The base salaries for our named executive officers are\nreviewed annually by the board of directors by taking into account the results achieved by each executive, his or her future potential, scope of\nresponsibilities and experience and competitive pay practices. Based upon the comprehensive review, the board of directors has determined the base\nsalaries to be equitable and competitive for our market.\nBonuses\nOur named executive officers receive incentive and/or bonus payments based on their employment agreements, as described below.\n132\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation Awards\nStock-based compensation awards may consist of options to acquire shares of our common stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or\nperformance stock units issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated T Acquisition, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Amended and Restated\nEquity Plan”), which, as described more fully below, allows the Compensation Committee to establish the terms and conditions of the awards, subject to\nthe terms of the Amended and Restated Equity Plan.\nOther Benefits and Perquisites\nThe named executive officers participate in our broad-based employee welfare benefit plans, such as medical, dental, vision, supplemental disability\nand term life insurance. The named executive officers also participate in our 401(k) plans. Under the T Bank, N.A. Employees Savings Plan, in which Mr.\nHoward is a participant, we match 100% of an employee’s contribution up to the first 1% and 50% up to next 5% of such employee’s salary up to the\n401(k) limit. Under the Tectonic Retirement Plan and Trust, in which Mr. Sherman and Mr. Clifford are participants, we match 100% of an employee’s\ncontribution up to the first 1% and 50% up to next 5% of such employee’s salary up to the 401(k) limit, identical to the T Bank, N.A. Employees Savings\nPlan. The named executive officers are provided the same benefits, and participate in the cost at the same rate, as all other employees.\nWe provide our named executive officers with certain perquisites that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation\nprogram to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The Compensation Committee will review the levels of perquisites\nand other personal benefits provided to named executive officers. Based on this periodic review, perquisites will be awarded or adjusted on an individual\nbasis. The perquisites received by our named executive officers in 2023 and 2022 included $2,839 for each year paid by the Company on behalf of Mr.\nHoward toward a $3,000,000 key man life insurance policy for Mr. Howard. In accordance with his employment agreement, 50% of the death benefit of this\npolicy is payable to Mr. Howard’s named beneficiaries.\nEmployment Agreements and Arrangements\nWe have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Sherman and amended and restated the employment agreement with Mr. Howard. The\nfollowing is a summary of the material terms of each such agreement. The Company has not entered into any material plan, contract or arrangement to\nwhich Mr. Clifford is a party.\nHaag Sherman. Mr. Sherman’s employment agreement has an initial term of four years and automatic one-year renewals thereafter unless either\nparty provides written notice of its intent not to renew at least 90 days prior to the renewal date. Under Mr. Sherman’s employment agreement, he is\nentitled to an annual base salary that is currently $375,000 and is eligible to receive an annual performance-based bonus payment to the extent the\napplicable performance criteria are satisfied.\nMr. Sherman is also eligible to receive certain other employee benefits and perquisites in accordance with our established policies, as described\nabove. In addition, Mr. Sherman’s employment agreement provides for certain restrictive covenants and severance benefits in the event of a qualifying\ntermination of employment and certain payments in connection with a “change in control” of the Company. See “—Potential Payments upon a\nTermination of Employment or a Change in Control.”\nPatrick Howard. As amended and restated, the employment agreement is for a term expiring on May 14, 2024 and automatic one-year renewals\nthereafter unless either party provides written notice of its intent not to renew at least 90 days prior to the renewal date. Under Mr. Howard’s amended\nand restated employment agreement, he is entitled to an annual base salary that is currently $350,000 and is eligible to receive an annual performance-\nbased bonus payment to the extent the applicable performance criteria are satisfied.\n133\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the execution of his original employment agreement, Mr. Howard received options to purchase 50,000 shares of our common\nstock with an exercise price equal to $2.15, which vested on May 15, 2020 (the “3-Year Tectonic Financial Options”), and options to purchase 50,000\nshares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to $2.15, which vested on May 15, 2021 (the “4-Year Tectonic Financial Options”). In addition,\nMr. Howard entered into a unit option agreement with Tectonic Holdings and received options to purchase 50,000 membership units of Tectonic Holdings\nwith an exercise price equal to $3.55, which vested on May 15, 2020 (the “3-Year Tectonic Holdings Options”), and he received options to purchase 50,000\nmembership units of Tectonic Holdings with an exercise price equal to $3.55, which vested on May 15, 2021 (the “4-Year Tectonic Holdings Options”). As\na result of the Tectonic Holdings Merger and the 1-for-2 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock, the 3-Year Tectonic Holding Options were\nconverted into options to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.70, which is the sum of the exercise prices of\nthe 3-Year Tectonic Holdings Options and the 3-Year Tectonic Financial Options, and the 4-Year Tectonic Holding Options were converted into options to\npurchase 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.70, which is the sum of the exercise prices of the 4-Year Tectonic\nHoldings Options and the 4-Year Tectonic Financial Options. Additionally, as a result of the Tectonic Holdings Merger and the 1-for-2 reverse stock split\nof the Company’s common stock, the 3-Year Tectonic Financial Options became exercisable for 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an\nexercise price of $5.70 and the 4-Year Tectonic Financial Options became exercisable for 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price\nof $5.70.\nMr. Howard is also eligible to receive certain other employee benefits and perquisites in accordance with our established policies, as described\nabove. In addition, Mr. Howard’s amended and restated employment agreement provides for certain restrictive covenants and severance benefits in the\nevent of a qualifying termination of employment and certain payments in connection with a “change in control” of the Company. See “—Potential\nPayments upon a Termination of Employment or a Change in Control.”\nDavid Clifford. Under Mr. Clifford’s employment arrangement, he is entitled to an annual base salary that is currently $375,000 and is eligible to\nreceive an annual performance-based bonus payment to the extent the applicable performance criteria are satisfied.\nMr. Clifford is also eligible to receive certain other employee benefits and perquisites in accordance with our established policies, as described\nabove.\nAmended and Restated T Acquisition, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe board of directors and Company shareholders have adopted the Amended and Restated Equity Plan. The Amended and Restated Equity Plan is\nintended to enable the Company to remain competitive and innovative in its ability to attract, motivate, reward, and retain the services of key employees\nand outside directors. The Amended and Restated Equity Plan allows for the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock\nappreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights, and other awards which may be\ngranted singly, in combination, or in tandem. The Amended and Restated Equity Plan is expected to provide flexibility to the Company’s compensation\nmethods in order to adapt the compensation of key employees and outside directors to a changing business environment (after giving due consideration\nto competitive conditions and the impact of accounting rules and federal tax laws).\nThe following is a brief description of the Amended and Restated Equity Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and\nRestated Equity Plan that is filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.\nPurpose. The purpose of our Amended and Restated Equity Plan is to attract, motivate, reward, and retain the services of key employees and outside\ndirectors by providing them with additional incentives, and to promote the success of our Company’s business.\nAdministration. Our board of directors or one or more committees appointed by our board of directors will administer the Amended and Restated\nEquity Plan.\nEligibility. Persons eligible to receive awards under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan include our officers, employees, consultants and\nmembers of our board of directors. Our board of directors or one or more committees appointed by our board of directors will determine from time to time\nthe participants to whom awards will be granted.\n134\nTable of Contents\nAuthorized Shares; Limits on Awards. The maximum number of common shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the\nAmended and Restated Equity Plan equals 750,000 shares, all of which may be subject to incentive stock option treatment. The Current Plan reserves\n750,000 shares of our common stock, of which 230,000 stock options and 210,000 restricted stock grants have been awarded, however 30,000 were\nforfeited and thus returned to the reserve under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan, leaving 340,000 remaining available for issuance.\nThe maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to all awards under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan shall\nincrease annually on the first day of each fiscal year following the adoption of the Amended and Restated Equity Plan by the number of common shares\nequal to the lesser of (i) three percent of the total issued and outstanding common shares on the first day of such fiscal year, or (ii) such lesser amount\ndetermined by our board of directors.\nAdjustments or Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any change in the outstanding common shares by reason of a stock split, stock dividend\nor other non-recurring dividends or distributions, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of stock,\nreorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction that affects our common stock, the aggregate number of shares of common\nstock available under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan or subject to outstanding awards (including the exercise price of any awards) shall be\nadjusted as our board of directors deems necessary or appropriate.\nIncentive Awards. The Amended and Restated Equity Plan authorizes stock options, SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance-\nbased awards, as well as other awards (described in the Amended and Restated Equity Plan) that are responsive to changing developments in\nmanagement compensation. The Amended and Restated Equity Plan retains the flexibility to offer competitive incentives and to tailor benefits to specific\nneeds and circumstances. Any award may be paid or settled in cash. An option or SAR will expire, or other award will vest, in accordance with the\nschedule set forth in the applicable award agreement.\nStock Option. A stock option is the right to purchase common shares at a future date at a specified price per share generally equal to, but no less\nthan, the fair market value of a share on the date of grant. An option may either be an Incentive Stock Option, or ISO, or a nonstatutory stock option, or\nNSO. ISO benefits are taxed differently from NSOs, and are subject to more restrictive terms and are limited in amount by the Code and the Amended and\nRestated Equity Plan. Full payment for shares purchased on the exercise of any option must be made at the time of such exercise in a manner approved by\nour board of directors.\nSARs. A SAR is the right to receive payment of an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a common share on the date of exercise of\nthe SAR over the base price of the SAR. The base price will be established by our board of directors at the time of grant of the SAR but will not be less\nthan the fair market value of a share on the date of grant. SARs may be granted in connection with other awards or independently.\nRestricted Stock. A restricted stock award is typically for a fixed number of common shares subject to restrictions. Our board of directors specifies\nthe price, if any, the participant must pay for such shares and the restrictions (which may include, for example, continued service and/or performance\nstandards) imposed on such shares. A stock bonus may be granted by our board of directors to any eligible person to reward exceptional or special\nservices, contributions or achievements in the manner and on such terms and conditions (including any restrictions on such shares) as determined from\ntime to time by our board of directors. The number of shares so awarded shall be determined by our board of directors and may be granted independently\nor in lieu of a cash bonus.\nRestricted Stock Units. A restricted stock unit is similar to a SAR except that it entitles the recipient to receive an amount equal to the fair market\nvalue of a common share.\n135\nTable of Contents\nPerformance-Based Awards. Our board of directors may designate any award, the exercisability or settlement of which is subject to the achievement\nof performance conditions, as a performance-based award. In order to qualify as performance-based compensation, the performance objective(s) used for\nthe performance-based award must be from the list of performance objectives set forth in the Amended and Restated Equity Plan. The performance\nobjectives set forth in the Amended and Restated Equity Plan are: interest income and expense; net earnings or net income; net interest margin; efficiency\nratio; reduction in non-accrual loans and non-interest expense; growth in non-interest income and ratios to earnings assets; net revenue growth and ratio\nto earning assets; capital ratios; asset or liability interest rate sensitivity and gap; effective tax rate; deposit growth and composition; liquidity\nmanagement; securities portfolio (value, yield, spread, maturity, or duration); asset growth and composition (loans, securities); non-interest income (e.g.,\nfees, premiums and commissions, loans, wealth management, treasury management, insurance, funds management) and expense; overhead ratios,\nproductivity ratios; credit quality measures; return on assets; return on equity; economic value of equity; compliance and CAMELS or other regulatory\nratings; internal controls; enterprise risk measures (e.g., interest rate, loan concentrations, portfolio composition, credit quality, operational measures,\ncompliance ratings, balance sheet, liquidity, insurance); volume in production or loans; non-performing asset or non-performing loan levels or ratios or\nloan delinquency levels; provision for credit losses or net charge-offs; cash flow; cost; revenues; sales; ratio of debt to debt plus equity; net borrowing,\ncredit quality or debt ratings; profit before tax; economic profit; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization; gross margin; profit margin; earnings per share; operating earnings; capital expenditures; expenses or expense levels; economic value\nadded; ratio of operating earnings to capital spending or any other operating ratios; free cash flow; net profit; net sales; net asset value per share; the\naccomplishment of mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, public offerings or similar extraordinary business transactions; sales growth; price of the\nCompany’s stock; return on investment; equity or shareholders’ equity; market share; inventory levels, inventory turn or shrinkage; customer\nsatisfaction; or total shareholder return. Our board of directors may select any number of performance objectives from this list of performance objectives\nwhen establishing the performance measures of a performance-based award, but such objectives must be set no later than 90 days after the beginning of\nthe applicable performance period. The Amended and Restated Equity Plan allows performance objectives to be described in terms of objectives that are\nrelated to an individual participant or objectives that are company-wide or related to a subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit\nand may be measured on an absolute or cumulative basis or on the basis of percentage of improvement over time, and may be measured in terms of\ncompany performance (or performance of the applicable subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit) or measured relative to\nselected peer companies or a market index.\nAcceleration of Awards; Possible Early Termination of Awards. Upon a change in control of our Company, outstanding awards under the\nAmended and Restated Equity Plan will be assumed or substituted on the same terms. However, if the successor corporation does not assume or\nsubstitute the outstanding awards, then vesting of these awards will fully accelerate, and in the case of options or SARs, will become immediately\nexercisable. For this purpose, a change in control is defined to include certain changes in the majority of our board of directors, the sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our Company’s assets, and the consummation of certain mergers or consolidations.\nTransfer Restrictions. Subject to certain exceptions, awards under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan are not transferable by the recipient other\nthan by will or the laws of descent and distribution and are generally exercisable, during the recipient’s lifetime, only by him or her.\nTermination of or Changes to the Amended and Restated Equity Plan. Our board of directors may amend or terminate the Amended and Restated\nEquity Plan at any time and in any manner. Unless required by applicable law or listing agency rule, stockholder approval for any amendment will not be\nrequired. Unless previously terminated by our board of directors, the Amended and Restated Equity Plan will terminate on March 27, 2029. Generally\nspeaking, outstanding awards may be amended, subject, however, to the consent of the holder if the amendment materially and adversely affects the\nholder.\n136\nTable of Contents\nFederal Income Tax Treatment of Awards under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan\nFederal income tax consequences (subject to change) relating to awards under the Amended and Restated Equity Plan are summarized in the\nfollowing discussion. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and, among other considerations, does not describe the deferred compensation\nprovisions of Section 409A of the Code to the extent an award is subject to and does not satisfy those rules, nor does it describe state, local, or\ninternational tax consequences.\nFor NSOs, the Company is generally entitled to deduct (and the optionee recognizes taxable income in) an amount equal to the difference between\nthe option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. For ISOs, our Company is generally not entitled to a deduction nor\ndoes the participant recognize income at the time of exercise. The current federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the\nAmended and Restated Equity Plan generally follow certain basic patterns: SARs are taxed and deductible in substantially the same manner as NSOs;\nnontransferable restricted stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture results in income recognition equal to the excess of the fair market value over the\nprice paid (if any) only at the time the restrictions lapse (unless the recipient elects to accelerate recognition as of the date of grant); bonuses and\nperformance share awards are generally subject to tax at the time of payment; cash-based awards are generally subject to tax at the time of payment; and\ncompensation otherwise effectively deferred is taxed when paid. Our Company will generally have a corresponding deduction at the time the participant\nrecognizes income. However, as for those awards subject to ISO treatment, our Company would generally have no corresponding compensation\ndeduction.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2023:\nOption Awards Stock Awards\nNumber of Number of Market\nSecurities Securities Number of Value of\nUnderlying Underlying Shares or Shares or\nUnexercised Unexercised Units of Stock Units of Stock\nOptions Options Option Option That Have That Have\nExercisable Unexercisable Exercise Expiration Not Vested Not Vested\nName (#) (#) Price Date (#) ($)\nA.

All of the amounts and benefits described\nabove are conditioned upon the executive executing a general release and waiver of claims in a form provided by us at the time of termination.\nChange in Control. Subject to the terms of the respective employment agreements, in the event of a change in control (as defined in the employment\nagreement of Mr. Howard, Mr. Howard will be eligible to receive a cash lump sum payment equal to 2.99 times his base amount (as defined in Section\n280G(b)(3) of the Code) payable by us within 30 days upon a change in control or under such other terms as may be mutually agreed. In the event that Mr.\nHoward is also entitled to any of the severance payments and benefits discussed above, any change in control will be offset by such amount.\nDirector Compensation\nThe following table shows compensation paid to members of our board of directors and the board of directors of the Company and the Bank during\n2023.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters\nThe following table provides information regarding the beneficial ownership of our capital stock as of March 27, 2023 for:\n●each of our directors;\n●each of our named executive officers;\n●all of our directors and executive officers as a group; and\n●each shareholder who beneficially owns more than 5% of our common stock.\nWe have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial\nowner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities, or\nhas the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. Shares of common stock that may be acquired by an individual or group within sixty days of March\n27, 2024, pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or other rights, are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage\nownership of such individual or group, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other\nperson shown in the table. The table below calculates the percentage of beneficial ownership of our common stock based on 7,102,680 shares of voting\ncommon stock and 1,725,000 shares of non-voting Series B preferred stock outstanding as of March 27, 2024. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this\ntable and subject to applicable community property laws, we believe that each person identified in the table has sole voting and investment power over all\nof the shares shown opposite such person’s name.\nExcept as indicated below, the address for each shareholder listed in the table below is: 16200 Dallas Parkway, Suite 190, Dallas, Texas 75248.\nCommon Stock Series B Preferred Stock\nBeneficially Owned Beneficially Owned\nNumber(7) Percentage Number Percentage\nName of Beneficial Owner\nDirectors and Named Executive Officers:\nGeorge L.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\nControlled Company\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NASDAQ corporate governance standards. As a result, although the members of our\nAudit Committee are required to be independent, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to\nhave a compensation committee or an independent nominating function under the NASDAQ rules. We intend to avail ourselves of the controlled\ncompany exemptions while we remain a controlled company.\nDirector Independence\nOur Series B preferred stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market and, consequently, we are required to comply with the rules of the NASDAQ\nStock Market with respect to the independence of directors who serve on our board of directors and its committees. Under the rules of NASDAQ, a\nmajority of the members of the board of directors must be “independent directors” by the one-year anniversary of the time we cease to be a controlled\ncompany. The rules of NASDAQ, as well as those of the SEC, impose several other requirements with respect to the independence of our directors.\nApplying these standards, our board of directors has determined that each of Eric Langford, Thomas McDougal and Barb Bomersbach is an\n“independent director” as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ rules. The board of directors has also determined that the members of\nthe Audit Committee are independent under the heightened standards of independence required by Section 5605(c)(2)(A) of the NASDAQ rules. In\nmaking these determinations, the board of directors considered the banking relationships with directors and their related interests which we enter into in\nthe ordinary course of our business, the arrangements which are disclosed below in this Item 13 and the compensation arrangements described in Item 12\nof this Form 10-K.\nCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\nPolicies and Procedures Regarding Related Person Transactions\nTransactions by us or the Bank with related persons are subject to regulatory requirements and restrictions. These requirements and restrictions\ninclude the Affiliates Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W (which governs certain transactions by the Bank with its affiliates) and the Federal\nReserve’s Regulation O (which governs certain loans by the Bank to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders). We have adopted\npolicies to comply with these regulatory requirements and restrictions.\nIn addition, our board of directors has adopted a written policy governing the approval of related person transactions that complies with all\napplicable requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ concerning related person transactions. Related person transactions are transactions in which we are a\nparticipant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related persons of the\nCompany include directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive officers, beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock and\nthe immediate family members of these persons. Our executive management team, in consultation with outside counsel, as appropriate, will review\npotential related person transactions to determine if they are subject to the policy. In determining whether to approve a related person transaction, that\ncommittee will consider, among other factors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or indirect nature of the related person’s interest in the\ntransaction, the appearance of an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer taking into account the size of the transaction and the\nfinancial position of the related person, whether the transaction would impair an outside director’s independence, the acceptability of the transaction to\nour regulators and the potential violations of other corporate policies.\nIn addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described in “Executive Compensation” above, the following is a\ndescription of each transaction since January 1, 2022, and each proposed transaction in which:\n● we have been or are to be a participant;\n● the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000; and\n● any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than five percent of our capital stock, or any immediate family member, of or\nperson sharing the household with, any of these individuals (other than tenants or employees), had or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest.\n140\nTable of Contents\nOther Transactions\nThe Company. The following are related party agreements and transactions to which the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries are a party and\nwhich are discussed in the next section.\nCain Watters Services Agreement. Darrell W. Cain, the founder of Cain Watters, was a co-founder of T Bancshares, the predecessor, and served on\nthe board of directors of T Bancshares when it was founded in 2003. At his request, the Bank established the trust department to serve clients of Cain\nWatters, which was accomplished in 2006. Since that time, the Bank has served as a fiduciary and custodian on behalf of clients referred by Cain Watters\nand, given the importance of this strategic relationship for both parties, partners of Cain Watters currently occupy four board seats of the Company and\nown approximately 31.20% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Cain Watters\nhave sought to have their relationship, as it relates to the trust services provided by the Bank, to be defined by an agreement.

Under this\nagreement, each party agrees to preserve one another’s business relationships with their respective clients, including mutual clients, and agrees not to\nsolicit or otherwise encourage clients to change service providers with respect to the services provided to such clients by one another. This provision\nincludes Cain Watters’ best efforts to preserve the Bank’s business relationships with clients of Cain Watters with respect to the Bank CIFs. This\nagreement provided for automatic one-year renewals, and was amended effective January 31, 2023 such that the termination clause coincides with the\nSupport Services Agreement (see below).

During the year ended December 31, 2023, Tectonic\nAdvisors earned $257,000 under the Support Services Agreement. These fees are included in investment advisory and other related services in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations.

This agreement was amended effective January 31, 2023 such that the\ntermination clause coincides with the Support Services Agreement (see below).\nOther Related Transactions. Other miscellaneous related party transactions resulted in other amounts due from related parties of less than $1,000,\nincluded within accounts receivable, related parties on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n141\nTable of Contents\nOrdinary Banking Relationships\nCertain of our officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates, are customers of, or have or\nhave had transactions with us or the Bank in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include deposits, loans, wealth management products\nand other financial services related transactions. Related party transactions are made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms,\nincluding interest rates and collateral (where applicable), as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to us, and do\nnot involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other features unfavorable to us. Any loans we originate with officers, directors and\nprincipal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates, are approved by our board of directors in accordance with the Bank’s\nregulatory requirements.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, no related party loans were categorized as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problem loans. We expect\nto continue to enter into transactions in the ordinary course of business on similar terms with our officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as\ntheir immediate family members and affiliates.\nItem 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nAudit Committee Pre-Approval\nThe Audit Committee’s charter authorizes the Audit Committee to approve, in advance, all auditing services and non-audit services that are\notherwise permitted by law that are provided to the Company by its independent auditors.

Definitions. Except as otherwise provided above, terminology used in this Policy shall have the following meanings:\n(a) \"Accounting Restatement\" means a requirement that the Company prepare an accounting restatement due to the material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, including any required accounting\nrestatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result\nin a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. Changes to the Company's financial\nstatements that do not represent error corrections are not an Accounting Restatement, including: (i) retrospective application of a change in accounting\nprinciple; (ii) retrospective revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company's internal organization; (iii)\nretrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (iv) retrospective application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization\nof entities under common control; and (v) retrospective revision for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in capital\nstructure.\n(b) \"Covered Individual\" shall mean, whether former or current, the (i) named executive officers of our Company; (ii) each\n\"executive officer\" of our Company (as such term is defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act); and (iii) any officer of our Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries that is designated by the Board as being subject to this Policy.\n(c) \"Erroneously Awarded Compensation\" means the amount of Incentive Compensation that was Received that exceeds the\namount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had the amount of Incentive Compensation been determined based on the\nrestated Financial Reporting Measures, computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Individual or by the Company on the Covered\nIndividual's behalf. For Incentive Compensation based on total shareholder return or Company stock price, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement, the amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation will be based on a reasonable estimate by the Board of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was Received. The Company will maintain documentation of the determination of that\nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq as required.\n(d) \"Financial Reporting Measures\" means (i) measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures (whether or not\nsuch measures are presented within the Company's financial statements or included in a filing made with the SEC), (ii) Company stock price and (iii)\nCompany total shareholder return.\n(e) \"Incentive Compensation\" shall mean a Covered Individual's cash bonus awarded under our Company's annual incentive plan\nand any equity-based awards granted pursuant to our Company's long-term incentive plans that are earned, paid/granted or vested wholly (or in part)\nupon the attainment of any Financial Reporting Measure of our Company.\n(f) \"Look-Back Period\" shall mean the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a\ncommittee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably\nshould have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized\nbody directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. In addition, if there is a change in the Company's fiscal year end, the Look-Back Period\nwill also include any transition period to the extent required by Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Listing Standards.\n(g) \"Received\" means Incentive Compensation that is actually or deemed received by the Covered Individual in the fiscal year to\nwhich the Financial Reporting Measure is attained, irrespective of whether the Incentive Compensation is subject to additional time or non-financial\nperformance vesting conditions.\n2. Recoupment of Incentive Compensation – Restatement of Financial Statements. Subject to the terms of this Policy and the requirements\nof Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Listing Standards, if the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, then the Company shall recover,\nreasonably promptly from each Covered Individual as set forth in Section 5, below, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Received by such\nCovered Individual during the Look-Back Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Policy shall be deemed automatically and\nunilaterally amended to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the applicable the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the\nCompany's securities are listed.\n3. Board Discretion. The Board may, in determining appropriate remedial action, take into account the financial cost of penalties or\npunishments imposed by third parties, such as law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities; however, such determinations shall not mitigate\nor eliminate the Company's obligations to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to Section 2 of this Policy.\n4. Amendment, Termination and Interpretation. The Board may at any time suspend, amend or terminate this Policy to the minimum extent\nnecessary to comply with applicable laws. Pursuant to Section 5, below, the Board shall have the sole discretion to interpret and enforce this Policy.\n5. Enforcement and Impracticability. The Board shall recover any Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such\nrecovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Board in accordance with Rule 10D-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act and Rule\n5608 of the Nasdaq Listing Standards. To the extent the Board determines to enforce recoupment, (i) the Board shall provide the Covered Individual\nwritten notice of its intent to recoup Incentive Compensation under this Policy, along with the timeline within which the Covered Individual must respond,\n(ii) to the extent the Covered Individual does not intend to comply with such recoupment efforts, he or she must respond to the Board in writing detailing\nthe reasons why non-compliance is warranted and such response must be provided to the Board within fifteen (15) business days from the Covered\nIndividual receiving the Board's initial notice, and (iii) if the Board disagrees with the Covered Individual's assertions, then the Board must respond to the\nCovered Individual in writing detailing such reasons within the fifteen (15) business days immediately following its receipt of the Covered Individual's\nwritten response.\n6. Determination of Means of Recovery. With respect to recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and subject to the requirement\nthat recovery be made reasonably promptly, the Board will determine the appropriate means of recovery, which may vary, without limitation, between\nCovered Individuals or based on the nature of the applicable Incentive Compensation, and which may involve, without limitation, establishing a deferred\nrepayment plan or set off against current or future compensation otherwise payable to the Covered Individual. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation will be made without regard to income taxes paid by the Covered Individual or by the Company on the Covered Individual's behalf in\nconnection with such Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n7. Compensation Not Subject to this Policy. Section 2 of this Policy does not apply to Incentive Compensation that was Received before\nOctober 2, 2023, and does not apply to Incentive Compensation that was Received by a Covered Individual before beginning service as an executive\nofficer.\n8. No Indemnification or Company-Paid Insurance. The Company will not indemnify or reimburse any Covered Individual against or for the\nloss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and will not pay or reimburse any Covered Individual for the purchase of a third-party insurance policy to\nfund potential recovery obligations.\n9. Effective Date. This Policy shall apply to all Covered Individuals from and after the Effective Date."
