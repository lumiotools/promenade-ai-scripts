(“RenovoRx” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RNXT)** , a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies and offering **RenovoCath****®** , a novel, FDA-cleared local drug-delivery platform, announced today that the Northwell Health Cancer Institute (“NHCI”) in New Hyde Park, NY is enrolling patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) in the Company’s ongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. NHCI joins esteemed clinical sites throughout the United States participating in the study.\n\n“We are pleased to be part of this pivotal study that holds the potential to transform the way we treat pancreatic cancer,” said Dr. Daniel King, MD, PhD of Medical Oncology at NHCI. “TAMP represents a novel approach to targeted chemotherapy delivery near the tumor site, which may improve efficacy while reducing systemic side effects. This study underscores our deep commitment to advancing cancer treatment and offering our patients access to the latest in therapeutic innovations.”\n\nThe TIGeR-PaC study is using RenovoRx’s TAMP (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform, to evaluate the Company’s first drug-device combination product candidate (intra-arterial infusion of gemcitabine via RenovoRx’s FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system). TAMP utilizes pressure-mediated delivery of gemcitabine to the target tumor. The study is comparing treatment with TAMP in LAPC to the current standard-of-care (systemic intravenous chemotherapy).\n\n“NHCI is a highly recognized cancer center in the United States and is dedicated to providing patients with access to the latest advances in oncology treatment. Dr. King and his team make an ideal partner for evaluating the potential benefits of our innovative TAMP therapy platform,” said Leesa Gentry, Chief Clinical Officer of RenovoRx. “Working with New York’s largest healthcare system is a major win for RenovoRx. We believe this collaboration will assist the Company in both accelerating patient enrollment in our pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial and driving the study towards its expected enrollment completion in the first half of 2025.”\n\n**About Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC)** According to the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts & Figures 2024 and PanCAN, respectively, pancreatic cancer has a 5-year all stages combined relative survival rate of 13% (Stages I-IV) and is on track to be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths before 2030. LAPC is diagnosed when the disease has not spread far beyond the pancreas, however, has advanced to the point where it cannot be surgically removed. LAPC is typically associated with patients in Stage 3 of the disease as determined by the TNM (tumor, nodes and metastasis) grading system.\n\n**About RenovoCath** Based on its FDA clearance, **RenovoCath****®** is intended for the isolation of blood flow and delivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the peripheral vascular system. RenovoCath is also indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion.

RenovoRx’s first product candidate using the TAMP technology, is a novel investigational oncology drug-delivery combination utilizing the Company’s FDA-cleared **RenovoCath****®** device for the intra-arterial administration of chemotherapy, gemcitabine.\n\nThe first interim analysis in the Phase III clinical trial was completed in March 2023, with the Data Monitoring Committee recommending a continuation of the study. The TIGeR-PaC study is investigating TAMP in LAPC. The study's primary endpoint is an Overall Survival benefit with secondary endpoints including reduced side effects versus standard of care. The second interim analysis for this study will be triggered by the 52nd event (i.e., patient death), which is estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025. The second interim data readout would follow thereafter, with the timing for such readout depending on customary factors such as time needed for analysis. RenovoRx is also aiming to complete patient enrollment in the TIGeR-PaC study in the first half of 2025.\n\n**About RenovoRx, Inc.** RenovoRx is a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies and offering **RenovoCath®** , a novel, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared local drug-delivery platform, targeting high unmet medical needs. RenovoRx’s patented **Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP™)** therapy platform is designed to ensure precise therapeutic delivery across the arterial wall near the tumor site to bathe the target tumor, while potentially minimizing a therapy’s toxicities versus systemic intravenous therapy. RenovoRx’s novel approach to targeted treatment offers the potential for increased safety, tolerance, and improved efficacy, and its mission is to transform the lives of cancer patients by providing innovative solutions to enable targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.\n\nThe Company’s Phase III lead product candidate is a novel oncology drug-device combination product.

(“RenovoRx” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RNXT), a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies and offering **RenovoCath** , a novel, FDA-cleared local drug-delivery platform, today announced its financial results and operational highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We made significant progress in the third quarter of 2024 towards our goal of patient enrollment completion of our pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is expected in the first half of 2025,” said Shaun Bagai, CEO of RenovoRx. “In parallel, we have made important headway on commercialization plans for our FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system, creating the potential for near-term revenue generation.”\n\nMr. Bagai added, “As part of our evolving commercialization strategy plans, we have increased production of RenovoCath supplies, and if we hit our targets (including developing or partnering for sales and marketing capabilities), we see the potential for near-term revenue in 2025. Importantly, with $9.6 million in cash as of September 30, we have sufficient cash on hand to achieve our next interim TIGeR-PaC analysis, which will be triggered by the 52nd event, estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025, and fund our current RenovoCath commercialization efforts.”\n\n**Key Business Third Quarter and Recent Highlights:**\n\n  * Commercialization efforts for the RenovoCath delivery system progressed in response to increasing demand from oncology and interventional radiology physicians indicating a need for improved, targeted delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents.Notably, RenovoRx signed a new work order with its manufacturing partner Medical Murray to increase production of RenovoCath devices. With manufacturing arrangements in place, RenovoRx is presently considering its best course for RenovoCath marketing and sales activities, which could be done directly or via a commercial partner. RenovoCath is indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. \n  * RenovoRx expects its RenovoCath commercial strategy to potentially generate revenue in 2025. \n  * Promoted Robert Strasser to Vice President of R&D and Operations. Strasser is a highly experienced, results-oriented, strategic business leader with a proven track record in operations and product commercialization management with prior roles at Cordis (Johnson & Johnson) and Boston Scientific. Strasser has served as RenovoRx’s Senior Director of R&D and Operations since October 2022, the same year he started managing RenovoRx’s relationship with Medical Murray. \n  * Enrolled the first patient at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) for the ongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. UNMC is the most recent clinical site to join TIGeR-PaC clinical study. UNMC is expected to drive enrollment of the TIGeR-PaC trial to completion in 2025 due to the large number of pancreatic patients they treat. \n  * Announced the publication of positive early-stage clinical data in an international peer-reviewed journal, The Oncologist®. The article titled “Treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC) Using Localized Trans-Arterial Micro Perfusion (TAMP) of Gemcitabine: Combined Analysis of RR1 and RR2,” is a publication of early-stage clinical data, primarily procedure safety, overall survival (OS), and evaluation of factors associated with OS, in LAPC patients undergoing TAMP from the foundational studies conducted by RenovoRx.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights for Third Quarter ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited):**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $9.6 million. \n  * **R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, remaining flat compared to the same period last year. Employee and related benefit costs increased $0.1 million including additional increase in clinical conferences and trade shows of $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by lower regulatory and clinical consulting costs and manufacturing for our proprietary catheter delivery device. We anticipate research and development expenses to increase as we increase manufacturing costs for our device and continue advancing our Phase III clinical trial study throughout the remainder of the year. \n  * **G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were approximately $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million compared to approximately $1.4 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $0.2 million in professional and consulting fees, and legal fees, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million in investor and public relations costs. We anticipate general and administrative expenses increasing moderately throughout the remaining year as we progress our commercialization activities for our RenovoCath device. \n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $1.3 million in the fair value of common warrants issued under our Registered Direct Offering in April 2023 and an increase in interest and dividend income of $0.1 million. \n  * **Shares Outstanding:** Shares of common stock outstanding, as of November 7, 2024, were 24,001,339.\n\n\n\n**About RenovoCath** Based on its FDA clearance, RenovoCath® is intended for the isolation of blood flow and delivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the peripheral vascular system.

(“RenovoRx” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RNXT)** , a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies based on a local drug-delivery platform, today announced that it is increasing the production of its FDA-cleared **RenovoCath** catheter-based delivery system due to increased demand for targeted delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents from oncologists and interventional radiologists.\n\nRenovoRx has signed a new project work order with its principal manufacturing partner, Medical Murray of North Barrington, IL, providing for an expanded relationship and as RenovoRx continues its exploration of commercial opportunities for RenovoCath beyond RenovoRx’s currently ongoing clinical programs. To create performance incentives for Medical Murray, RenovoRx will issue Medical Murray a warrant to purchase up to 709,500 shares of RenovoRx common stock. This warrant vests over time and only if Medical Murray achieves certain manufacturing milestones.\n\nIn parallel, RenovoRx remains fully engaged and committed to its ongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). As recently announced, additional well known clinical sites are now participating in the study with the goal of accelerating patient enrollment. TIGeR-PaC is using the TAMP™ (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform to evaluate RenovoRx’s first drug-device combination product candidate (intra-arterial infusion of chemotherapy, gemcitabine HCl) to target the tumor in LAPC. The study is comparing treatments with TAMP to the current standard of care (systemic intravenous chemotherapy).\n\nLeesa Gentry, Chief Clinical Officer of RenovoRx, commented, “As we continue to make steady progress with our pivotal Phase III trial in LAPC, we have received feedback from oncology and interventional radiology physicians and key opinion leaders expressing the desire to purchase RenovoCath as a standalone device to be used in clinical practice. RenovoCath has been used in over 500 procedures by interventionalists over the past several years. We have published data from completed early-stage clinical trials that highlight the potential benefits to patients receiving targeted therapy with RenovoCath, including less toxicity and better outcomes, over the current standard of care.”\n\nShaun Bagai, Chief Executive Officer of RenovoRx, commented, “We announced in our most recent SEC quarterly report that we are actively exploring commercial opportunities to meet what we see as growing demand for our proprietary RenovoCath technology. Beyond LAPC, we believe there are many clinical applications for RenovoCath to improve targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Securing the manufacturing capacity for this strategy with our partner Medical Murray is a great first step. We are also in active discussions with many interested customers to purchase supplies of RenovoCath as well as potential distribution partners. When launched, we expect our commercial strategy to accelerate our path to revenue generation, which we hope will occur during 2025. At the same time, even without incremental revenues from this commercial strategy, we maintain sufficient cash on hand from our successful fundraisings earlier this year to achieve both our next interim read-out on TIGeR-PaC, which will be triggered by the 52nd event (i.e., patient death), estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025, and fund our current efforts for our RenovoCath go to market activities.”\n\nMr. Bagai continued, “In preparation for commercialization of RenovoCath as a stand-alone device, and in addition to accelerating our manufacturing capacity with Medical Murray, we are pleased to have promoted Robert Strasser to Vice President of R&D and Operations. Bob has been an important part of our interface with Medical Murray and with our commercial strategy plans, and we look forward to his continued contributions in this new role.”\n\nRobert Strasser is a highly experienced, results-oriented, strategic business leader with a proven track record in operations and product commercialization management with prior roles at Cordis (Johnson & Johnson) and Boston Scientific. Mr. Strasser has served as RenovoRx’s Senior Director of R&D and Operations since October 2022, the same year he started managing the Company’s relationship with Medical Murray.\n\n**About RenovoCath** Based on its FDA clearance, **RenovoCath****®** is intended for the isolation of blood flow and delivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the peripheral vascular system. RenovoCath is also indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. RenovoCath is intended for general intravascular and peripheral vascular in arteries for vessel entry and occlusion ranging between 3mm and 11mm in diameter. The diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents are to be used in accordance with specifications outlined by the respective agent manufacturer.\n\n**About the TIGeR-PaC Clinical Trial** TIGeR-PaC is an ongoing Phase III randomized multi-center study evaluating the proprietary **TAMP™** (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform for the treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC.) RenovoRx’s first product candidate using the TAMP technology, is a novel investigational oncology drug-delivery combination utilizing the Company’s FDA-cleared **RenovoCath****®** device for the intra-arterial administration of chemotherapy, gemcitabine HCl.\n\nThe first interim analysis in the Phase III clinical trial was completed in March 2023, with the Data Monitoring Committee recommending a continuation of the study. The TIGeR-PaC study is investigating TAMP in LAPC. The study's primary endpoint is a 6-month Overall Survival benefit with secondary endpoints including reduced side effects versus standard of care. The second interim analysis for this study will be triggered by the 52nd event, which is estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n**About RenovoRx, Inc.** RenovoRx is a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies based on a local drug delivery platform for high unmet medical need with a goal to improve therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients undergoing treatment. RenovoRx’s patented **Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP™)** therapy platform is designed to ensure precise therapeutic delivery across the arterial wall near the tumor site to bathe the target tumor, while potentially minimizing a therapy’s toxicities versus systemic intravenous therapy. RenovoRx’s novel approach to targeted treatment offers the potential for increased safety, tolerance, and improved efficacy. Our Phase III lead product candidate is a novel oncology drug-device combination product. It is being investigated under a U.S. investigational new drug application that is regulated by the FDA’s 21 CFR 312 pathway. The investigational drug-device combination candidate utilizes **RenovoCath****®****,** the Company’s FDA-cleared drug-delivery device, indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. The intra-arterial infusion of gemcitabine HCl by the RenovoCath catheter is currently being evaluated for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (the drug division of FDA).\n\nRenovoRx is also actively exploring other commercialization strategies utilizing its TAMP technology and FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system as a stand-alone device. The intra-arterial infusion of gemcitabine HCl by the RenovoCath catheter is currently under investigation and has not been approved for commercial sale.\n\nRenovoRx is committed to transforming the lives of patients by providing innovative solutions to enable targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.\n\nFor more information, visit [www.renovorx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=V8GSRlYaDZwzWrR1wKWFUtt-Du21QlEosOXBV4_zxMORKMx-KHhXQpXLwAUtWtPdTAreMUMM8520oGX3BiFG5Q== \"Opens in a new window\").

(“RenovoRx” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RNXT), a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies and offering **RenovoCath** , a novel, FDA-cleared local drug-delivery platform, today announced its financial results and operational highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We made significant progress in the third quarter of 2024 towards our goal of patient enrollment completion of our pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is expected in the first half of 2025,” said Shaun Bagai, CEO of RenovoRx. “In parallel, we have made important headway on commercialization plans for our FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system, creating the potential for near-term revenue generation.”\n\nMr. Bagai added, “As part of our evolving commercialization strategy plans, we have increased production of RenovoCath supplies, and if we hit our targets (including developing or partnering for sales and marketing capabilities), we see the potential for near-term revenue in 2025. Importantly, with $9.6 million in cash as of September 30, we have sufficient cash on hand to achieve our next interim TIGeR-PaC analysis, which will be triggered by the 52nd event, estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025, and fund our current RenovoCath commercialization efforts.”\n\n**Key Business Third Quarter and Recent Highlights:**\n\n  * Commercialization efforts for the RenovoCath delivery system progressed in response to increasing demand from oncology and interventional radiology physicians indicating a need for improved, targeted delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents.Notably, RenovoRx signed a new work order with its manufacturing partner Medical Murray to increase production of RenovoCath devices. With manufacturing arrangements in place, RenovoRx is presently considering its best course for RenovoCath marketing and sales activities, which could be done directly or via a commercial partner. RenovoCath is indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. \n  * RenovoRx expects its RenovoCath commercial strategy to potentially generate revenue in 2025. \n  * Promoted Robert Strasser to Vice President of R&D and Operations. Strasser is a highly experienced, results-oriented, strategic business leader with a proven track record in operations and product commercialization management with prior roles at Cordis (Johnson & Johnson) and Boston Scientific. Strasser has served as RenovoRx’s Senior Director of R&D and Operations since October 2022, the same year he started managing RenovoRx’s relationship with Medical Murray. \n  * Enrolled the first patient at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) for the ongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. UNMC is the most recent clinical site to join TIGeR-PaC clinical study. UNMC is expected to drive enrollment of the TIGeR-PaC trial to completion in 2025 due to the large number of pancreatic patients they treat. \n  * Announced the publication of positive early-stage clinical data in an international peer-reviewed journal, The Oncologist®. The article titled “Treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC) Using Localized Trans-Arterial Micro Perfusion (TAMP) of Gemcitabine: Combined Analysis of RR1 and RR2,” is a publication of early-stage clinical data, primarily procedure safety, overall survival (OS), and evaluation of factors associated with OS, in LAPC patients undergoing TAMP from the foundational studies conducted by RenovoRx.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights for Third Quarter ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited):**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $9.6 million. \n  * **R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, remaining flat compared to the same period last year. Employee and related benefit costs increased $0.1 million including additional increase in clinical conferences and trade shows of $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by lower regulatory and clinical consulting costs and manufacturing for our proprietary catheter delivery device. We anticipate research and development expenses to increase as we increase manufacturing costs for our device and continue advancing our Phase III clinical trial study throughout the remainder of the year. \n  * **G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were approximately $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million compared to approximately $1.4 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $0.2 million in professional and consulting fees, and legal fees, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million in investor and public relations costs. We anticipate general and administrative expenses increasing moderately throughout the remaining year as we progress our commercialization activities for our RenovoCath device. \n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $1.3 million in the fair value of common warrants issued under our Registered Direct Offering in April 2023 and an increase in interest and dividend income of $0.1 million. \n  * **Shares Outstanding:** Shares of common stock outstanding, as of November 7, 2024, were 24,001,339.\n\n\n\n**About RenovoCath** Based on its FDA clearance, RenovoCath® is intended for the isolation of blood flow and delivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the peripheral vascular system.

RenovoRx’s first product candidate using TAMP technology, is a novel investigational oncology drug-delivery combination utilizing the Company’s FDA-cleared RenovoCath® device for the intra-arterial administration of chemotherapy, gemcitabine.\n\nThe first interim analysis in the Phase III clinical trial was completed in March 2023, with the Data Monitoring Committee recommending a continuation of the study. The TIGeR-PaC study is investigating TAMP in LAPC. The study's primary endpoint is an overall survival benefit with secondary endpoints including reduced side effects versus standard of care. The second interim analysis for this study will be triggered by the 52nd event (i.e., patient death), which is estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025. The second interim data readout would follow thereafter, with the timing for such readout depending on customary factors such as time needed for analysis. RenovoRx is also aiming to complete patient enrollment in the TIGeR-PaC study in the first half of 2025.\n\n**About RenovoRx, Inc.** RenovoRx is a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies and offering **RenovoCath®** , a novel, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared local drug-delivery platform, targeting high unmet medical needs.

(“RenovoRx” or\nthe “Company”) (Nasdaq: RNXT), a life sciences company developing novel targeted\noncology therapies and offering RenovoCath, a novel, FDA-cleared local drug-delivery\nplatform, today announced its financial results and operational highlights for the third quarter\nended September 30, 2024.\n“We made significant progress in the third quarter of 2024 towards our goal of patient\nenrollment completion of our pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial in locally advanced\npancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is expected in the first half of 2025,” said Shaun Bagai,\nCEO of RenovoRx. “In parallel, we have made important headway on commercialization\nplans for our FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system, creating the potential for near-term\nrevenue generation.”\nMr. Bagai added, “As part of our evolving commercialization strategy plans, we have\nincreased production of RenovoCath supplies, and if we hit our targets (including developing\nor partnering for sales and marketing capabilities), we see the potential for near-term\nrevenue in 2025. Importantly, with $9.6 million in cash as of September 30, we have\nsufficient cash on hand to achieve our next interim TIGeR-PaC analysis, which will be\ntriggered by the 52nd event, estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025, and fund our\ncurrent RenovoCath commercialization efforts.”\nKey Business Third Quarter and Recent Highlights:\nCommercialization efforts for the RenovoCath delivery system progressed in response\nto increasing demand from oncology and interventional radiology physicians indicating\na need for improved, targeted delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents.\nNotably, RenovoRx signed a new work order with its manufacturing partner Medical\nMurray to increase production of RenovoCath devices. With manufacturing\narrangements in place, RenovoRx is presently considering its best course for\nRenovoCath marketing and sales activities, which could be done directly or via a\ncommercial partner. RenovoCath is indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in\napplications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic\ndrug infusion.\nRenovoRx expects its RenovoCath commercial strategy to potentially generate\nrevenue in 2025.\nPromoted Robert Strasser to Vice President of R&D and Operations. Strasser is a\nhighly experienced, results-oriented, strategic business leader with a proven track\nrecord in operations and product commercialization management with prior roles at\nCordis (Johnson & Johnson) and Boston Scientific. Strasser has served as\nRenovoRx’s Senior Director of R&D and Operations since October 2022, the same\nyear he started managing RenovoRx’s relationship with Medical Murray.\nEnrolled the first patient at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) for the\nongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. UNMC is the most recent clinical site\nto join TIGeR-PaC clinical study. UNMC is expected to drive enrollment of the TIGeR-\nPaC trial to completion in 2025 due to the large number of pancreatic patients they\ntreat.\nAnnounced the publication of positive early-stage clinical data in an international peer-\nreviewed journal, The Oncologist®. The article titled “Treatment of Locally Advanced\nPancreatic Cancer (LAPC) Using Localized Trans-Arterial Micro Perfusion (TAMP) of\nGemcitabine: Combined Analysis of RR1 and RR2,” is a publication of early-stage\nclinical data, primarily procedure safety, overall survival (OS), and evaluation of factors\nassociated with OS, in LAPC patients undergoing TAMP from the foundational studies\nconducted by RenovoRx.\nFinancial Highlights for Third Quarter ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited):\nCash Position: Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $9.6\nmillion.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were approximately $1.7\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, remaining flat compared to\nthe same period last year. Employee and related benefit costs increased $0.1 million\nincluding additional increase in clinical conferences and trade shows of $0.1 million.\nThese increases were partially offset by lower regulatory and clinical consulting costs\nand manufacturing for our proprietary catheter delivery device. We anticipate research\nand development expenses to increase as we increase manufacturing costs for our\ndevice and continue advancing our Phase III clinical trial study throughout the\nremainder of the year.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were approximately $1.2\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately\n$0.2 million compared to approximately $1.4 million for the same period last year. The\ndecrease was primarily due to decreases of $0.2 million in professional and consulting\nfees, and legal fees, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million in investor and public\nrelations costs. We anticipate general and administrative expenses increasing\nmoderately throughout the remaining year as we progress our commercialization\nactivities for our RenovoCath device.\nNet Loss: Net loss was $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to net loss of $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease is primarily due to a decrease of $1.3 million in the fair value of common\nwarrants issued under our Registered Direct Offering in April 2023 and an increase in\ninterest and dividend income of $0.1 million.\nShares Outstanding: Shares of common stock outstanding, as of November 7, 2024,\nwere 24,001,339.\nAbout RenovoCath\nBased on its FDA clearance, RenovoCath® is intended for the isolation of blood flow and\ndelivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the\nperipheral vascular system.
