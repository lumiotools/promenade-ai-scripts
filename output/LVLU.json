(“Lulus” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LVLU) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024.\n\n**Crystal Landsem, CEO of Lulus, said:**\n\n“Third quarter net revenue came in ahead of our outlook, driven by record growth in special occasion and bridesmaid dress categories, boosting overall dress sales and reinforcing our strength in event apparel. This gain was offset by continued softness in our casual wear business, which we are strategically reevaluating to better align with our core focus on event attire. As a result, we took a proactive approach to inventory management, leveraging markdowns and promotions to end the quarter with a 7% decline in inventory, outpacing our 3% decline in net revenue. While these actions weighed on gross margins, they support our efforts to sustain demand and drive top line growth.\n\nTo that end, our ongoing strategic initiatives and cost reduction efforts are firmly in place and we are working towards securing more flexible, longer term options in place of our existing revolving credit facility to support the near term financial flexibility and long-term growth of Lulus. We remain confident in our brand, the opportunities ahead, and the value we deliver to our customers, and are committed to building a strong foundation for sustainable growth.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n  * Net revenue of $80.5 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $83.1 million in the same period last year, driven by a 3% decrease in Total Orders Placed and a 2% decrease in Average Order Value (“AOV”) from $133 to $131, offset by reduced return rates.\n  * Active Customers of 2.7 million, a decrease of 10% compared to 3.0 million in the same period last year and flat compared to the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Gross profit decreased 9% to $30.6 million and Gross Margin decreased 220 basis points to 38.1%, in each case compared to the same period last year.\n  * Net loss of $6.9 million, compared to $3.9 million in the same period last year. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA* of ($3.6) million, compared to $1.0 million in the same period last year. \n  * Net cash used in operating activities of $5.5 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12.7 million in the same period last year.\n  * Free Cash Flow* of ($6.3) million, compared to $11.6 million in the same period last year.\n  * Total debt increased by $11.5 million and $3.5 million during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively.\n  * Net Debt* increased by $7.0 million and decreased by $0.3 million during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Tiffany Smith, CFO of Lulus, said:**\n\n“Our focus through Q4 is on generating additional liquidity, maintaining healthy inventory turns, and accelerating a reset of our shoes and separates assortments. Amid ongoing macro uncertainties and consumer pressures, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management to ensure we maintain a healthy financial position. Our fourth quarter and full-year net revenue outlook contemplates continued momentum in our special occasion and event wear categories, balanced by a targeted product assortment reset in underperforming casual categories, the latter of which tempers our Q4 sales expectations. Continued macroeconomic pressures and our product assortment reset introduce some uncertainty in Q4 margin and profitability expectations; therefore, we are not issuing a fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA outlook at this time. Our confidence remains high in achieving our long-term sales and profitability targets.”\n\n**Updated Financial Outlook:**\n\n  * Fourth quarter 2024 net revenue is expected to be between approximately $67.5 million and $70.0 million, compared to $75 million in the same period last year. Full year 2024 net revenue is expected to be between approximately $317.5 million and $320 million, compared to $355.2 million in fiscal year 2023.\n  * The full-year 2024 capital expenditure plan has been reduced to approximately $3.2 million, a reduction of $0.3 million relative to our previous estimate.\n\n\n\nForecasting future results or trends is inherently difficult for any business, and actual results or trends may differ materially from those forecasted. Lulus’ outlook is based on current indications for its business. Lulus’ outlook factors in our current best estimates for anticipated headwinds, including those related to the level of demand, spending and returns by our customers, macroeconomic uncertainties, inflation, supply chain pressures, and shipping costs and the intended impact of cost-reduction measures. Given the volatile nature of current consumer demand and potential for further impacts to consumer behavior due to macroeconomic factors, including continued inflation, higher interest rates, the presidential election, as well as other world events, wars, and domestic and international conflicts that affect overall consumer confidence and the predictability of consumer purchasing behavior, Lulus’ financial outlook is subject to change.\n\n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND****COMPREHENSIVE LOSS****(Unaudited)****(In thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**| **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n**September 29,**| **October 1,**| **September 29,**| **October 1,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet revenue| $| 80,515| $| 83,118| $| 249,740| $| 280,216  \nCost of revenue| 49,866| 49,593| 144,562| 161,334  \nGross profit| 30,649| 33,525| 105,178| 118,882  \nSelling and marketing expenses| 17,624| 16,825| 60,231| 60,984  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 19,869| 21,575| 62,416| 70,319  \nLoss from operations| (6,844| )| (4,875| )| (17,469| )| (12,421| )  \nInterest expense| (305| )| (442| )| (958| )| (1,391| )  \nOther income, net| 281| 270| 779| 716  \nLoss before benefit (provision) for income taxes| (6,868| )| (5,047| )| (17,648| )| (13,096| )  \nIncome tax benefit (provision)| (11| )| 1,158| (5,763| )| 992  \nNet loss and comprehensive loss| $| (6,879| )| $| (3,889| )| $| (23,411| )| $| (12,104| )  \nBasic loss per share| $| (0.16| )| $| (0.10| )| $| (0.57| )| $| (0.31| )  \nDiluted loss per share| $| (0.16| )| $| (0.10| )| $| (0.57| )| $| (0.31| )  \nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding| 41,702,122| 40,103,152| 41,358,919| 39,672,938  \nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding| 41,702,122| 40,103,152| 41,358,919| 39,672,938  \n  \n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(Unaudited)****(In thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n---  \n**September 29,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 6,308| $| 2,506  \nAccounts receivable| 4,467| 3,542  \nInventory, net| 38,477| 35,472  \nAssets for recovery| 4,852| 3,111  \nIncome tax refund receivable| 2,562| 2,510  \nPrepaids and other current assets| 8,655| 5,379  \nTotal current assets| 65,321| 52,520  \nProperty and equipment, net| 4,376| 4,712  \nGoodwill| 35,430| 35,430  \nTradename| 18,509| 18,509  \nIntangible assets, net| 2,850| 3,263  \nLease right-of-use assets| 25,508| 29,516  \nOther noncurrent assets| 1,539| 5,495  \nTotal assets| $| 153,533| $| 149,445  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 11,371| $| 8,900  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities| 26,621| 18,343  \nReturns reserve| 15,308| 7,854  \nStored-value card liability| 16,042| 13,142  \nRevolving line of credit| 11,500| 8,000  \nLease liabilities, current| 5,793| 5,648  \nTotal current liabilities| 86,635| 61,887  \nLease liabilities, noncurrent| 21,020| 25,427  \nOther noncurrent liabilities| 2,109| 1,179  \nTotal liabilities| 109,764| 88,493  \n**Stockholders' equity:**  \nPreferred stock: $0.001 par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized, and no shares issued or outstanding| —| —  \nCommon stock: $0.001 par value, 250,000,000 shares authorized;

All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our opportunities for growth in the coming quarters, the long-term growth trajectory of our business, our efforts to secure alternative debt financing, the intended impact of cost-reduction measures and our financial outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter ending December 29, 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause Lulus’ actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release.

The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our ongoing core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and other operating metrics are presented below. We also use certain key operating metrics, including Gross Margin, Active Customers, Average Order Value, and Total Orders Placed.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation and other non-routine expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation and other non-routine expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of our net revenue.\n\n**Active Customers**\n\nWe define Active Customers as the number of customers who have made at least one purchase across our platform in the prior 12-month period. We consider the number of Active Customers to be a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to consumer awareness of our brand, our ability to attract visitors to our digital platform, and our ability to convert visitors to paying customers. Active Customer counts are based on de-duplication logic using customer account and guest checkout name, address, and email information.\n\n**Average Order Value**\n\nWe define Average Order Value (“AOV”) as the sum of the total gross sales before returns across our platform in a given period, plus shipping revenue, less discounts and markdowns, divided by the Total Orders Placed (as defined below) in that period. AOV reflects average basket size of our customers. AOV may fluctuate as we continue investing in the development and introduction of new Lulus merchandise and as a result of our promotional discount activity.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment. We view Free Cash Flow as an important indicator of our liquidity because it measures the amount of cash we generate. \n\n**Gross Margin**\n\nWe define Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. Certain of our competitors and other retailers report cost of revenue differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and Gross Margin may not be comparable to other companies.\n\n**Net Cash (Debt)**\n\nNet Cash (Debt) is defined as total debt, which currently consists of the revolving line of credit, less cash and cash equivalents. We consider Net Cash (Debt) to be an important supplemental measure of our financial position, which allows us to analyze our leverage. \n\n**Total Orders Placed**\n\nWe define Total Orders Placed as the number of customer orders placed across our platform during a particular period. An order is counted on the day the customer places the order. We do not adjust the number of Total Orders Placed for any cancellation or return that may have occurred subsequent to a customer placing an order. We consider Total Orders Placed as a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to our ability to attract and retain customers as well as drive purchase frequency. Total Orders Placed, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to generate in a particular period.\n\n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****KEY OPERATING AND FINANCIAL METRICS****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**| **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n**September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**| **September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**  \n**(In thousands, except Average Order Value and percentages)**  \nGross Margin| 38.1| %| 40.3| %| 42.1| %| 42.4| %  \nNet loss| $| (6,879| )| $| (3,889| )| $| (23,411| )| $| (12,104| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (3,572| )| $| 972| $| (6,438| )| $| 5,207  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| (4.4| )%| 1.2| %| (2.6| )%| 1.9| %  \nAverage Order Value| $| 131| $| 133| $| 139| $| 133  \nActive Customers| 2,670| 2,960| 2,670| 2,960  \n  \nNote: Refer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics” section above for definitions of these metrics.\n\n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES****(Unaudited)**\n\nA reconciliation to non-GAAP Net Cash (Debt) from total debt as of September 29, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**September 29,2024**| **June 30,2024**| **December 31,2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \nTotal debt (1)| $| (11,500| )| $| —| $| (8,000| )  \nCash and cash equivalents| 6,308| 1,781| 2,506  \nNet Cash (Debt)| $| (5,192| )| $| 1,781| $| (5,494| )  \n(1) Consists of the revolving line of credit  \n  \nA reconciliation to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA from net loss for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 is as follows:\n\n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**| **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**| **September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**  \n**(In thousands, except percentages)**  \nNet loss| $| (6,879| )| $| (3,889| )| $| (23,411| )| $| (12,104| )  \nExcluding:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,392| 1,240| 4,102| 3,546  \nInterest expense| 305| 442| 958| 1,391  \nIncome tax benefit (provision)| 11| (1,158| )| 5,763| (992| )  \nEquity-based compensation expense (1)| 2,022| 4,337| 6,150| 13,366  \nReversal of other non-routine expense (2)| (423| )| —| —| —  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (3,572| )| $| 972| $| (6,438| )| $| 5,207  \nNet loss margin| (8.5| )%| (4.7| )%| (9.4| )%| (4.3| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| (4.4| )%| 1.2| %| (2.6| )%| 1.9| %  \n  \n(1)| The thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 include equity-based compensation expense for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted during the period and prior periods, performance stock units (“PSUs”) and equity-based awards granted in prior periods, as well as forfeitures partially offset by accelerated vesting expense associated with the resignation of directors during the period.

(“Lulus” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LVLU) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024.\n\n**Crystal Landsem, CEO of Lulus, said:**\n\n“Third quarter net revenue came in ahead of our outlook, driven by record growth in special occasion and bridesmaid dress categories, boosting overall dress sales and reinforcing our strength in event apparel. This gain was offset by continued softness in our casual wear business, which we are strategically reevaluating to better align with our core focus on event attire. As a result, we took a proactive approach to inventory management, leveraging markdowns and promotions to end the quarter with a 7% decline in inventory, outpacing our 3% decline in net revenue. While these actions weighed on gross margins, they support our efforts to sustain demand and drive top line growth.\n\nTo that end, our ongoing strategic initiatives and cost reduction efforts are firmly in place and we are working towards securing more flexible, longer term options in place of our existing revolving credit facility to support the near term financial flexibility and long-term growth of Lulus. We remain confident in our brand, the opportunities ahead, and the value we deliver to our customers, and are committed to building a strong foundation for sustainable growth.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n  * Net revenue of $80.5 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $83.1 million in the same period last year, driven by a 3% decrease in Total Orders Placed and a 2% decrease in Average Order Value (“AOV”) from $133 to $131, offset by reduced return rates.\n  * Active Customers of 2.7 million, a decrease of 10% compared to 3.0 million in the same period last year and flat compared to the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Gross profit decreased 9% to $30.6 million and Gross Margin decreased 220 basis points to 38.1%, in each case compared to the same period last year.\n  * Net loss of $6.9 million, compared to $3.9 million in the same period last year. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA* of ($3.6) million, compared to $1.0 million in the same period last year. \n  * Net cash used in operating activities of $5.5 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12.7 million in the same period last year.\n  * Free Cash Flow* of ($6.3) million, compared to $11.6 million in the same period last year.\n  * Total debt increased by $11.5 million and $3.5 million during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively.\n  * Net Debt* increased by $7.0 million and decreased by $0.3 million during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Tiffany Smith, CFO of Lulus, said:**\n\n“Our focus through Q4 is on generating additional liquidity, maintaining healthy inventory turns, and accelerating a reset of our shoes and separates assortments. Amid ongoing macro uncertainties and consumer pressures, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management to ensure we maintain a healthy financial position. Our fourth quarter and full-year net revenue outlook contemplates continued momentum in our special occasion and event wear categories, balanced by a targeted product assortment reset in underperforming casual categories, the latter of which tempers our Q4 sales expectations. Continued macroeconomic pressures and our product assortment reset introduce some uncertainty in Q4 margin and profitability expectations; therefore, we are not issuing a fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA outlook at this time. Our confidence remains high in achieving our long-term sales and profitability targets.”\n\n**Updated Financial Outlook:**\n\n  * Fourth quarter 2024 net revenue is expected to be between approximately $67.5 million and $70.0 million, compared to $75 million in the same period last year. Full year 2024 net revenue is expected to be between approximately $317.5 million and $320 million, compared to $355.2 million in fiscal year 2023.\n  * The full-year 2024 capital expenditure plan has been reduced to approximately $3.2 million, a reduction of $0.3 million relative to our previous estimate.\n\n\n\nForecasting future results or trends is inherently difficult for any business, and actual results or trends may differ materially from those forecasted. Lulus’ outlook is based on current indications for its business. Lulus’ outlook factors in our current best estimates for anticipated headwinds, including those related to the level of demand, spending and returns by our customers, macroeconomic uncertainties, inflation, supply chain pressures, and shipping costs and the intended impact of cost-reduction measures. Given the volatile nature of current consumer demand and potential for further impacts to consumer behavior due to macroeconomic factors, including continued inflation, higher interest rates, the presidential election, as well as other world events, wars, and domestic and international conflicts that affect overall consumer confidence and the predictability of consumer purchasing behavior, Lulus’ financial outlook is subject to change.\n\n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND****COMPREHENSIVE LOSS****(Unaudited)****(In thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**| **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n**September 29,**| **October 1,**| **September 29,**| **October 1,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet revenue| $| 80,515| $| 83,118| $| 249,740| $| 280,216  \nCost of revenue| 49,866| 49,593| 144,562| 161,334  \nGross profit| 30,649| 33,525| 105,178| 118,882  \nSelling and marketing expenses| 17,624| 16,825| 60,231| 60,984  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 19,869| 21,575| 62,416| 70,319  \nLoss from operations| (6,844| )| (4,875| )| (17,469| )| (12,421| )  \nInterest expense| (305| )| (442| )| (958| )| (1,391| )  \nOther income, net| 281| 270| 779| 716  \nLoss before benefit (provision) for income taxes| (6,868| )| (5,047| )| (17,648| )| (13,096| )  \nIncome tax benefit (provision)| (11| )| 1,158| (5,763| )| 992  \nNet loss and comprehensive loss| $| (6,879| )| $| (3,889| )| $| (23,411| )| $| (12,104| )  \nBasic loss per share| $| (0.16| )| $| (0.10| )| $| (0.57| )| $| (0.31| )  \nDiluted loss per share| $| (0.16| )| $| (0.10| )| $| (0.57| )| $| (0.31| )  \nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding| 41,702,122| 40,103,152| 41,358,919| 39,672,938  \nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding| 41,702,122| 40,103,152| 41,358,919| 39,672,938  \n  \n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(Unaudited)****(In thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n---  \n**September 29,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 6,308| $| 2,506  \nAccounts receivable| 4,467| 3,542  \nInventory, net| 38,477| 35,472  \nAssets for recovery| 4,852| 3,111  \nIncome tax refund receivable| 2,562| 2,510  \nPrepaids and other current assets| 8,655| 5,379  \nTotal current assets| 65,321| 52,520  \nProperty and equipment, net| 4,376| 4,712  \nGoodwill| 35,430| 35,430  \nTradename| 18,509| 18,509  \nIntangible assets, net| 2,850| 3,263  \nLease right-of-use assets| 25,508| 29,516  \nOther noncurrent assets| 1,539| 5,495  \nTotal assets| $| 153,533| $| 149,445  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 11,371| $| 8,900  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities| 26,621| 18,343  \nReturns reserve| 15,308| 7,854  \nStored-value card liability| 16,042| 13,142  \nRevolving line of credit| 11,500| 8,000  \nLease liabilities, current| 5,793| 5,648  \nTotal current liabilities| 86,635| 61,887  \nLease liabilities, noncurrent| 21,020| 25,427  \nOther noncurrent liabilities| 2,109| 1,179  \nTotal liabilities| 109,764| 88,493  \n**Stockholders' equity:**  \nPreferred stock: $0.001 par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized, and no shares issued or outstanding| —| —  \nCommon stock: $0.001 par value, 250,000,000 shares authorized;

All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our opportunities for growth in the coming quarters, the long-term growth trajectory of our business, our efforts to secure alternative debt financing, the intended impact of cost-reduction measures and our financial outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter ending December 29, 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause Lulus’ actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release.

The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our ongoing core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and other operating metrics are presented below. We also use certain key operating metrics, including Gross Margin, Active Customers, Average Order Value, and Total Orders Placed.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation and other non-routine expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation and other non-routine expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of our net revenue.\n\n**Active Customers**\n\nWe define Active Customers as the number of customers who have made at least one purchase across our platform in the prior 12-month period. We consider the number of Active Customers to be a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to consumer awareness of our brand, our ability to attract visitors to our digital platform, and our ability to convert visitors to paying customers. Active Customer counts are based on de-duplication logic using customer account and guest checkout name, address, and email information.\n\n**Average Order Value**\n\nWe define Average Order Value (“AOV”) as the sum of the total gross sales before returns across our platform in a given period, plus shipping revenue, less discounts and markdowns, divided by the Total Orders Placed (as defined below) in that period. AOV reflects average basket size of our customers. AOV may fluctuate as we continue investing in the development and introduction of new Lulus merchandise and as a result of our promotional discount activity.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment. We view Free Cash Flow as an important indicator of our liquidity because it measures the amount of cash we generate. \n\n**Gross Margin**\n\nWe define Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. Certain of our competitors and other retailers report cost of revenue differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and Gross Margin may not be comparable to other companies.\n\n**Net Cash (Debt)**\n\nNet Cash (Debt) is defined as total debt, which currently consists of the revolving line of credit, less cash and cash equivalents. We consider Net Cash (Debt) to be an important supplemental measure of our financial position, which allows us to analyze our leverage. \n\n**Total Orders Placed**\n\nWe define Total Orders Placed as the number of customer orders placed across our platform during a particular period. An order is counted on the day the customer places the order. We do not adjust the number of Total Orders Placed for any cancellation or return that may have occurred subsequent to a customer placing an order. We consider Total Orders Placed as a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to our ability to attract and retain customers as well as drive purchase frequency. Total Orders Placed, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to generate in a particular period.\n\n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****KEY OPERATING AND FINANCIAL METRICS****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**| **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n**September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**| **September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**  \n**(In thousands, except Average Order Value and percentages)**  \nGross Margin| 38.1| %| 40.3| %| 42.1| %| 42.4| %  \nNet loss| $| (6,879| )| $| (3,889| )| $| (23,411| )| $| (12,104| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (3,572| )| $| 972| $| (6,438| )| $| 5,207  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| (4.4| )%| 1.2| %| (2.6| )%| 1.9| %  \nAverage Order Value| $| 131| $| 133| $| 139| $| 133  \nActive Customers| 2,670| 2,960| 2,670| 2,960  \n  \nNote: Refer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics” section above for definitions of these metrics.\n\n**LULU’S FASHION LOUNGE HOLDINGS, INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES****(Unaudited)**\n\nA reconciliation to non-GAAP Net Cash (Debt) from total debt as of September 29, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**September 29,2024**| **June 30,2024**| **December 31,2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \nTotal debt (1)| $| (11,500| )| $| —| $| (8,000| )  \nCash and cash equivalents| 6,308| 1,781| 2,506  \nNet Cash (Debt)| $| (5,192| )| $| 1,781| $| (5,494| )  \n(1) Consists of the revolving line of credit  \n  \nA reconciliation to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA from net loss for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 is as follows:\n\n**Thirteen Weeks Ended**| **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**| **September 29,2024**| **October 1,2023**  \n**(In thousands, except percentages)**  \nNet loss| $| (6,879| )| $| (3,889| )| $| (23,411| )| $| (12,104| )  \nExcluding:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,392| 1,240| 4,102| 3,546  \nInterest expense| 305| 442| 958| 1,391  \nIncome tax benefit (provision)| 11| (1,158| )| 5,763| (992| )  \nEquity-based compensation expense (1)| 2,022| 4,337| 6,150| 13,366  \nReversal of other non-routine expense (2)| (423| )| —| —| —  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (3,572| )| $| 972| $| (6,438| )| $| 5,207  \nNet loss margin| (8.5| )%| (4.7| )%| (9.4| )%| (4.3| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| (4.4| )%| 1.2| %| (2.6| )%| 1.9| %  \n  \n(1)| The thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 include equity-based compensation expense for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted during the period and prior periods, performance stock units (“PSUs”) and equity-based awards granted in prior periods, as well as forfeitures partially offset by accelerated vesting expense associated with the resignation of directors during the period.
