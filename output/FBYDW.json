In addition, Infinite and [Falcon’s Beyond Global, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffalconsbeyond.com%2F&esheet=54155457&newsitemid=20241119722148&lan=en-US&anchor=Falcon%26%238217%3Bs+Beyond+Global%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=bbca2e3c6de9a5523b071ac0248b090f) (Nasdaq: FBYD) (“Falcon’s Beyond”), a visionary leader in innovative and immersive storytelling through Falcon’s Creative Group, Falcon’s Beyond Destinations and Falcon’s Beyond Brands, today announced that they have entered into a nonbinding LOI for Falcon’s Beyond to operate OES.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nOES, the entertainment focused arm of OII, has been an industry leader in developing complex ride and show systems for over 25 years. OES is an award-winning pioneer of entertainment systems and show equipment and a trusted provider to the world’s top theme park developers and operators. \n\nOES and Falcon’s Beyond have collaborated on themed entertainment projects globally for more than two decades. If the transactions proceed, Infinite, as the owner of OES, would tap Falcon’s Beyond’s expertise to operate OES, including its development and support of trackless ride vehicles, flying theaters _and beyond_ . Falcon’s Beyond would seek to employ key OES staff in operating OES. \n\n“We are excited about the opportunity to own and grow OES,” said Lucas Demerau, President of Infinite. “We believe that Falcon’s expertise in experiential themed entertainment and technology makes them a great fit and they’ll be able to operate and further amplify the OES brand.” \n\n“We are thrilled to pursue the opportunity to operate OES and to build upon OES’ legacy of innovation powered by world-class employees,” said Cecil D. Magpuri, CEO of Falcon’s Beyond. “This strategic move would further bolster Falcon’s Beyond’s platform as a world-class entertainment provider.” \n\n“Falcon’s innovative attraction development and storytelling prowess make it an ideal operator of OES,” said Dave Mauck, Vice President and General Manager of OII. “Existing OES customers would remain customers of OES, with Falcon’s Beyond servicing the contracts and providing the same high quality and level of service that has built OES’s stellar reputation.” \n\nThe transactions involving Infinite, OII, OES and Falcon’s Beyond are subject to ongoing discussions, due diligence and the execution of binding agreements, and there is no assurance that binding agreements for the transactions will be executed. \n\n**About Infinite Acquisitions Partners LLC**\n\n**Infinite Acquisitions Partners** , based in Henrico, Virginia, is a major stockholder of Falcon’s Beyond. \n\n**About Falcon’s Beyond**\n\n**Falcon’s Beyond** is a visionary innovator in immersive storytelling, sitting at the intersection of three potential high growth business opportunities: content, technology, and experiences.

We’ve achieved substantial revenue growth in Falcon’s Creative Group compared to last year, positioning us for continued success as we move into 2025 and beyond. One of the key highlights of this quarter is our ongoing project work for the Qiddiya Investment Company in Saudi Arabia focused on the master planning and designing of several first-of-its-kind immersive entertainment projects for Qiddiya City, which further showcase our commitment to delivering services that create innovation and groundbreaking entertainment. We are thrilled with the progress and the positive reception that our projects have garnered thus far. With the momentum we’ve built and our unwavering focus across all divisions, we are more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our stakeholders.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Falcon’s Beyond generated consolidated revenues of $2.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing fees for corporate and shared services earned from its FCG division and management fees from its Producciones de Parques, S.L. (“PDP”) 50:50 joint venture with Melia Hotels Int’l. The Company’s FCG subsidiary was deconsolidated and accounted for as an equity method investment for all periods subsequent to July 27, 2023. \n  * FCG recorded revenues of $13.2 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $8.6 million, or 190%, over the corresponding period of 2023. FCG recorded operating income of $0.1 million and a net loss of $0.1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with an operating loss of ($5.2) million and net loss of ($5.1) million for the corresponding 2023 period. After the Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC) preferred return and amortization of basis difference, Falcon’s Beyond’s net loss from FCG was $1.7 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. \n  * PDP recognized revenues of $17.8 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, a $2.0 million increase over the corresponding 2023 period, primarily due to increases in occupancy and rates at the Tenerife and Mallorca properties. Income from operations increased $1.1 million to $5.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and net income increased $0.2 million to $3.2 million, as compared with the corresponding 2023 period. Falcon’s Beyond’s share of income was $1.6 million from PDP for Q3 2024. \n  * Falcon’s Beyond’s consolidated net income increased by $35.0 million to $39.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a $40.6 million gain from change in fair value of earnout liabilities, a $17.9 million decrease in losses from operations, a $1.5 million increase in share of gains from equity method investments, a $0.7 million change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and a $1.6 million increase in foreign exchange gains, partially offset by a $27.4 million gain from deconsolidation of FCG in the prior year comparative quarter. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased $4.6 million to ($1.6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to ($6.2) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a $1.6 million increase in share of gain from equity method investments, a $1.6 million increase in foreign exchange gains and a $1.84 million increase in revenues from shared services following the deconsolidation of FCG in 2023, partially offset by a $0.4 increase in other expenses. \n  * Effective September 30, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Infinite Acquisition Partners, LLC, a greater than 10% shareholder, to increase the Revolving Line of Credit from a $10 million facility to a $15 million facility. The amended facility is unsecured, bears simple interest on the unpaid principal at a rate equal to three-month SOFR plus 2.75% (previously 2.75%), payable quarterly in arrears. This facility will mature on September 30, 2034. \n  * Also effective on September 30, 2024, the Company terminated and replaced $14.8 million of Term Debt with Infinite Acquisitions partners. The new term loan is unsecured, bears interest a rate of 8% per annum (previously 3% per annum), payable quarterly in areas and will mature on September 30, 2034. Principal amortization on this Term debt commences on October 1, 2029. \n  * The Company’s legacy investors agreed to forfeit all outstanding performance based earnout shares held in escrow for their benefit, in order to reduce volatility in earnings created by the accounting treatment of these awards. 437,500 shares of Class A common stock and 17,062,500 shares of Class B common stock and units were forfeited on September 30, 2024. \n  * On September 30, 2024, the Company declared a stock dividend of 0.2 shares of class A common stock per share of Class A common stock outstanding, payable on December 17, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 10, 2024. A total of approximately 2.0 million shares of Class A common stock and approximately 11.5 million shares of Class B common stock are expected to be issued in connection with the stock dividend. \n\n_______________________  \n---  \n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Use and Definition of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below for more information and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.   \n  \nJo Merrill, Chief Financial Officer of Falcon's Beyond, stated, “We continue to see positive momentum in our third quarter with a year-over-year increase in revenue in excess of 190% in Falcon’s Creative Group, and a significant reduction in Company overhead costs. The Company has taken significant steps this quarter to restructure and simplify its capital and debt stack to pave the way for the near-term expansion of the business segments as we approached our first anniversary as a public company.” \n\n**About Falcon’s Beyond**\n\n**Falcon’s Beyond** is a visionary innovator in immersive storytelling, sitting at the intersection of three potential high growth business opportunities: content, technology, and experiences.

When used in this press release, words such as “will”, “aimed”, “expected” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements, including (1) our ability to sustain our growth, effectively manage our anticipated future growth, and implement our business strategies to achieve the results we anticipate, (2) impairments of our intangible assets and equity method investment in our joint ventures, (3) our ability to raise additional capital, (4) the closure of Katmandu Park DR and the repositioning and rebranding of our FBD business, (5) the success of our growth plans in FCG, (6) our customer concentration in FCG, (7) the risk that contractual restrictions relating to the Strategic Investment may affect our ability to access the public markets and expand our business, (8) the risks of doing business internationally, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (9) our indebtedness and reliance on related parties with respect to such indebtedness, (10) our dependence on strategic relationships with local partners in order to offer and market our products and services in certain jurisdictions, (11) our reliance on our senior management and key employees, and our ability to hire, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, (12) cybersecurity-related risks, (13) our ability to protect our intellectual property, (14) our ability to remediate identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, (15) the concentration of share ownership and the significant influence of the Demerau Family and Cecil D.

In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with US GAAP, we disclose information regarding Adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), determined in accordance with US GAAP, for the period presented, before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, transaction expenses related to the business combination, credit loss expense, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and change in fair value of earnout liabilities. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as it eliminates the non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from our capital investments and intangible assets recognized in any business combination and improves comparability by eliminating the interest expense associated with our debt facilities, which may not be comparable with other companies based on our structure. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is included below under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure”. \n\n**FALCON’S BEYOND GLOBAL, INC.

By choosing prominent leaders with diverse expertise, Falcon’s is poised to position the business for continued success and future growth. \n\n“As the experience economy accelerates, we recognize the value of bringing in distinguished industry leaders who are masters of their craft to participate in discussions regarding strategic guidance, insights and knowledge to help us amplify our momentum and navigate our path forward,” said Cecil D. Magpuri, CEO of Falcon’s Beyond. \n\nAs Falcon’s first Strategic Advisor, Hightower will provide strategic guidance for Falcon’s theme park and entertainment ventures, particularly in the development and integration of innovative ride and show systems to further enhance Falcon's themed immersive attractions. He also will advise the business on potential acquisitions, assist with client relations, and help enhance Falcon’s network within the industry by building new relationships with key influential stakeholders and potential clients and partners that can help contribute to the continued growth and success of the company. \n\nWith 30+ years as a globally renowned theme park project leader, Hightower has been instrumental in shaping the themed entertainment industry and has championed innovative parks, lands, attractions, and experiences from concept through opening for Universal theme parks across the globe. His leadership was a driving force behind the innovative design, engineering and ambitious expansion of Universal’s world class destinations and properties including the opening of Universal's Islands of Adventure, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, as well as Universal Studios Japan. Hightower played an integral role in the development process and has been involved in all aspects of planning, design and delivery of Universal theme parks, resorts, restaurant and retail venues and new ventures ranging from Orlando, Hollywood, Japan, Spain, Dubai, Singapore, and Beijing. \n\n“I’m excited to establish our Advisory Board with Mike as the first member on the board,” said Cecil D. Magpuri, CEO of Falcon’s Beyond. “Mike’s proven track record of success speaks for itself. We’ve known each other for more than two decades and I’ve always admired his brilliance in stewardship and ability to make the impossible possible in theme park development. When I was thinking of establishing the Advisory Board, Mike was top of mind, and I’m incredibly honored he has stepped onboard as a Strategic Advisor. He is uniquely qualified with the methodological expertise to meet our business needs and perfectly aligns with our vision to create next level entertainment experiences worldwide.” \n\n“I am excited to join Falcon’s Beyond as the first member of their Advisory Board,” said Mike Hightower, former president of Universal Creative. “I wasn’t planning to work again after retiring from Universal, but after reconnecting with Cecil and meeting his senior team, I felt this role is a perfect fit for me. Falcon’s has impressed me with their innovation, professionalism and collaborative culture. I look forward to leveraging my experience in support of Falcon’s fast paced growth.” \n\nEstablishing the Advisory Board with Hightower as the first Strategic Advisor for Falcon’s Beyond is just the latest move during a time of unprecedented growth for the Company, which has been scaling up its workforce to support creative projects worldwide.
