Values: Curiosity, Optimism, Respect, and Equality**\n\nTevogen Bio’s culture, known as C.O.R.E., underpins the company’s mission and fosters a collaborative environment built on Curiosity, Optimism, Respect, and Equality. These values are more than guiding principles—they are foundational to how Tevogen operates, empowering teams to push the boundaries of science while fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\n“Tevogen’s C.O.R.E. values reflect leaderships commitment to embracing diverse perspectives, encouraging a readiness to learn, and creating solutions with a shared purpose,” said Victor Sordillo, Board Member of Tevogen Bio.\n\nRyan Saadi, MD, MPH, Founder and CEO, Tevogen Bio, commented, “I commend Tevogen’s leadership for steering the company’s remarkable growth strategy. With over three decades in this sector, I see Tevogen’s significant achievements since inception as a testament to the strength of our efficient business model. While excessive dilution at public listing, leaving founding teams with around 5% ownership, is common, Tevogen stands apart with 78% ownership intact. As we pursue ambitious growth, equity-based financing must never be an option. You can't make a difference without being different.”\n\n**About Tevogen Bio**\n\nTevogen is a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy company harnessing one of nature’s most powerful immunological weapons, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to develop off-the-shelf, genetically unmodified precision T cell therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancers, and neurological disorders, aiming to address the significant unmet needs of large patient populations.

Due to US GAAP accounting rules, the company was unable to report the fair market value of its assets, including proprietary immunotherapy technologies and cutting-edge artificial intelligence platforms. The company believes that the inclusion of Tevogen’s IP assets on its balance sheet would significantly enhance its enterprise value.\n\nTevogen reiterated its confidence in its financial stability, confirming sufficient available capital to fund operations for at least the next 33 months, supported by a loan agreement, which Tevogen entered into in June. Additionally, Tevogen eliminated almost all of its liabilities which were $99.9 million as reported at December 31, 2023 and now are $10.5 million as reported at September 30, 2024.\n\nKirti Desai, CPA, Tevogen’s CFO, commented, “The company is in a unique position as it relates to reporting intangible assets on our balance sheet. Tevogen has multiple granted patents, which were developed internally, and as per US GAAP rules, these internally developed intangible assets are not reported on the balance sheet as they do not have an acquisition price. This is significantly different than IP obtained through acquisition which can be capitalized as a noncurrent asset on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized like an intangible asset.”\n\nDr. Ryan Saadi, Founder and CEO of Tevogen Bio added, “The lack of an established market price to assign fair value of our highly appraised internally developed assets on our balance sheet, marks a distinct difference from similar cell therapy companies, such as Gilead and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which are able to capitalize similar assets acquired through multibillion-dollar acquisitions.\"\n\nCommenting on the company’s performance and unique ownership structure, Dr. Saadi concluded, “Tevogen’s leadership stands apart in the biotech sector, with approximately 78% of equity retained by our officers, an extraordinary figure compared to the industry average of just 4%. In addition to our officers, our key employees have also been granted substantial restricted stock units in the company, reflecting our belief that our employees should also be owners of our success.”\n\n**About Tevogen Bio**\n\nTevogen is a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy company harnessing one of nature’s most powerful immunological weapons, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to develop off-the-shelf, genetically unmodified precision T cell therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancers, and neurological disorders, aiming to address the significant unmet needs of large patient populations.

The time interval between cancer treatments allow the body to recover\nmore so than the cancer can recover.\n• With prolonged gaps in cancer treatment, there is more time for the cancer to re-grow, allowing resistant cells to\nbecome a larger part of the tumor.\n• Even a 4-week delay in treatment is associated with higher risk of death across surgical, chemotherapy, and radiation\ntherapy treatments in 7 common cancers1. With a longer treatment gap, a higher risk exists of cancer cells becoming\nresistant and cancer treatment failing.\nAfter TVGN 489 therapy, patients were able to move rapidly to stem cell transplant, which ablates virtually all immunity,\nwithout any resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 symptoms or other activity.\nPatients should thus be consistently more likely to resume their cancer treatment more quickly after TVGN 489.2\n1.

Phase 1 clinical trials are designed in part to generate proof of concept data and safety-related data on tolerability and side effects.\n2. A pivotal trial is a trial designed to generate data sufficient to support the filing of an application for regulatory approval. A pivotal trial may not necessarily be denoted as a Phase 3 clinical\ntrial, and instead may be a Phase 2 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. We believe that Phase 2, Phase 2/3, or Phase 3 clinical trials may serve as pivotal trials for TVGN 489.\n3. We believe that the safety data from our completed Phase 1 clinical trial should be sufficient to serve as the basis for one or more later stage, potentially pivotal trials in acute SARS-CoV-2\npatients with B-cell cancer immune suppression, other B cell immune suppressed acute SARS-CoV-2 patients with a B cell cancer indication, and for Long COVID prevention and treatment.\nWe cannot be certain whether we will be permitted to move from a Phase 1 trial directly to a pivotal trial covering any specific target population until the FDA reviews and concurs with or\nrejects our proposed plans, and the FDA may require us to conduct further trials to generate additional safety and efficacy data prior to approval.\n4.
