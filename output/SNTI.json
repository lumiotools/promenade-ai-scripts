SENTI-202 has three main components. First, the OR GATE, which is an activating CAR that targets CD33 and FLT3. By targeting either or both of these antigens, SENTI-202 could effectively kill both the leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells that form an important basis for AML disease. Second, the NOT GATE, which is designed to recognize the healthy cells and protect those healthy cells from being killed. Third, the calibrated-release IL-15 technology, which is designed to significantly increase cell persistence, expansion and activity of both the CAR- NK cells and the host immune cells. The NK cells used to construct SENTI-202 are sourced from healthy adult donors, which have been screened based on a set of criteria that reflect manufacturability and product quality, and are then cryopreserved prior to use in manufacturing to minimize variability. Senti Bio is currently enrolling adult patients with r/r CD33 and/or FLT3 expressing hematologic malignancies in a Phase 1 clinical trial for SENTI-202, which can be a potential first-in-class allogeneic treatment for AML/MDS patients. Senti Bio anticipates releasing initial clinical trial results for SENTI-202 by year-end 2024.\n\nSenti Bio has [published](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fnXOZU0WRsKDYJETq-xIc30H3tyHactDUdB08Op3SIWu_9M4ZQ30mHMm1jycZ-b2U8pp_oILpKKqYUY5mgimWODhkFwGe-8g1nNaqjt1ACqTG1ID7nBj730T7b_d2xKgtlhtiNXbbVb__PQqu_uaGFroI1YEEhaufFbDzHK_ErNt11yM7Vqc3V8m5w4GV7I-dvTasen5G5PQfUvZyOViIMvaiLTHTwKXmZHYEC695q7fACm-IKtTS-ymKBTLnWI-Z27MwZtJKuWl4lauO4n98HxHhU6QtU1hf4wEuTrY2YcqiowQ8QNIAn7eFuHnLgtd) SENTI-202 preclinical data demonstrating the potential of Logic Gated CAR-NK cell therapy for the treatment of AML.\n\n**About Senti Bio** Senti Bio is a biotechnology company developing a new generation of cell and gene therapies for patients living with incurable diseases.
