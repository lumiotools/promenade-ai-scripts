(NASDAQ: CHTR) (along with its subsidiaries, \"Charter\") and Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ: LBRDA, LBRDK, LBRDP) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Charter has agreed to acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Charter Communications, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2515592/Charter_Communications_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2515592/Charter_Communications_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, each holder of Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, Series B common stock, and Series C common stock (collectively, \"Liberty Broadband common stock\") will receive 0.236 of a share of Charter common stock per share of Liberty Broadband common stock held, with cash to be issued in lieu of fractional shares. Each holder of Liberty Broadband Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock (\"Liberty Broadband preferred stock\") will receive one share of newly issued Charter cumulative redeemable preferred stock (\"Charter preferred stock\") per share of Liberty Broadband preferred stock held, which Charter preferred stock will substantially mirror the current terms of the Liberty Broadband preferred stock.\n\nLiberty Broadband's principal assets currently consist of approximately 45.6 million common shares of Charter and its subsidiary GCI, LLC (\"GCI\"), Alaska's largest communications provider. Liberty Broadband has agreed to spin off its GCI business by way of a distribution to the stockholders of Liberty Broadband prior to the closing of the acquisition of Liberty Broadband by Charter. The GCI distribution is expected to be taxable to Liberty Broadband and its stockholders, with Charter bearing the corporate level tax liability upon completion of the combination. However, to the extent such corporate level tax liability exceeds $420 million, Charter will be entitled under a tax receivables agreement to the portion of the tax benefits realized by GCI corresponding to such excess. The companies currently expect the transaction to close on June 30, 2027 unless otherwise agreed, subject to the completion of the GCI spin-off and other customary closing conditions. \n\nAs a result of the transaction, Charter expects to retire the approximately 45.6 million Charter shares currently owned by Liberty Broadband and to issue approximately 34.0 million shares to holders of Liberty Broadband common stock at the closing, resulting in a net decrease of approximately 11.5 million Charter shares outstanding. Liberty Broadband has existing debt of $2.6 billion (excluding debt at GCI) that will be repaid prior to closing or assumed by Charter, and $180 million of preferred equity that will become Charter preferred equity following the close of the transaction.\n\nThe transaction was unanimously recommended to the Charter Board of Directors for approval by a special committee composed of independent, disinterested directors and advised by independent financial and legal advisors. The Boards of Directors of both Charter and Liberty Broadband have approved the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including (among others):\n\n  * Approval of the merger agreement and related transactions by holders of: \n    * A majority of the aggregate voting power of Charter's outstanding stock eligible to vote, excluding shares owned by Liberty Broadband and certain other persons\n    * A majority of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Broadband's outstanding stock eligible to vote\n    * A majority of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Broadband's outstanding stock eligible to vote, excluding shares owned by John C. Malone and certain other persons and entities\n  * Approval of the stock issuance by holders of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Charter's outstanding stock\n  * The receipt of any applicable regulatory approvals\n\n\n\nJohn Malone and certain related holders have agreed to vote, subject to certain exceptions, shares beneficially owned by them, representing approximately 48% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Broadband, in favor of the transaction. Greg Maffei, President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Broadband, and certain related holders have also agreed to vote, subject to certain exceptions, shares beneficially owned by them, representing approximately 4% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Broadband, in favor of the transaction.\n\nIn addition, in connection with the entry into the transaction, Charter, Liberty Broadband and Advance/Newhouse Partnership have agreed to amend certain existing governance arrangements of Charter to, among other things, modify the way in which Charter repurchases its shares of common stock from Liberty Broadband during the pendency of the transaction. Charter intends to make repurchases of Charter shares from Liberty Broadband in amounts of approximately $100 million per month, subject to certain adjustments, and as needed incremental repurchases or loans to Liberty Broadband, to allow for the timely repayment of Liberty Broadband debt in anticipation of the combination of the companies at closing. Liberty Broadband will remain subject to the existing voting cap of 25.01%. Proceeds from share repurchases applied to debt service are expected to be tax free.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce this agreement today with Liberty Broadband. I am grateful for Liberty Broadband's strategic partnership since 2013, and particularly for the support of John Malone, Greg Maffei and our Liberty Broadband nominated board members,\" said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter. \"We look forward to their continued partnership and support in the coming years in driving value for our shareholders.\"\n\n\"Today's announced transaction will rationalize Liberty Broadband's trading discount and ultimately provide our shareholders with enhanced liquidity,\" said John Malone, Chairman of Liberty Broadband. \"The transaction closing timeline reflects my belief in Charter's operating strategy under the excellent leadership of Chris Winfrey and team and the value creation opportunity for both Charter and Liberty shareholders. I look forward to that continued upside, and to holding Charter shares after the merger closing.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached definitive terms with Charter and provide Liberty shareholders with certainty of a future transaction at an attractive exchange ratio. This transaction simplifies our corporate structure and allows our shareholders to participate in Charter's upside through direct ownership of the equity. In connection with the transaction, we expect GCI will become an independent public company prior to close. Liberty has had a great partnership with Ron Duncan and GCI management since 2018 and will continue to participate in value creation opportunities for the business,\" said Greg Maffei, President & CEO of Liberty Broadband. \"Reaching this agreement was an important milestone in my leadership of the company, and I will be stepping down from my role as Liberty Broadband CEO at the end of this year. I look forward to continuing as a director of Charter and a meaningful shareholder.\"\n\nCenterview Partners LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to the special committee of Charter.

GCI cash was flat in the third quarter as cash from operations were offset by capital expenditures (net of grant proceeds) and net debt repayment. \n\nLiberty Broadband debt was relatively flat in the third quarter as net debt issuance at Liberty Broadband offset net debt repayment at GCI.

If one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points, each access point is counted as a subscriber. Data cable modem subscribers as of September 30, 2024 include 900 subscribers that were reclassified from GCI Business to GCI Consumer subscribers in the first quarter of 2024 and are not new additions.   \nc)  |  A wireless line in service is defined as a wireless device with a monthly fee for services. Wireless lines in service as of September 30, 2024 include 1,800 lines that were reclassified from GCI Business to GCI Consumer lines in the first quarter of 2024 and are not new additions.   \n  \nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\nGCI revenue increased 9% in the third quarter. Consumer revenue increased 2% driven by growth in data revenue. Business revenue increased 16% driven by a strong upgrade cycle in schools and healthcare corporations in remote Alaska. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased $12 million and $11 million, respectively, in the third quarter in line with higher revenue, partially offset by increased operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses grew driven by higher distribution costs to healthcare, education and consumer customers. Selling, general and administrative expenses grew due to increases in labor-related and software subscription costs, partially offset by lower lease expense. \n\nIn the third quarter, GCI spent $39 million, net, on capital expenditures. Capital expenditure spending was related primarily to improvements to the wireless and data networks in rural Alaska. GCI's net capital expenditures for the full year 2024 are expected to be approximately $200 million related to additional high-returning investments in middle and last mile connectivity, with continued network expansion in GCI’s most important markets in rural Alaska including the Bethel and AU-Aleutians fiber projects. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Broadband will discuss these highlights and other matters on Liberty Broadband's earnings conference call that will begin at 11:15 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 407-3944 or (412) 902-0038, passcode 13744090, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time.

Links to this press release and replays of the call will also be available on Liberty Broadband’s website. \n\n_This press release includes certain forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about business strategies, market potential, future financial prospects, capital expenditures, the proposed transaction with Charter and its expected benefits, matters relating to Liberty Broadband’s equity interest in Charter and Charter’s buyback of common stock, Liberty Broadband’s participation in Charter’s buyback of common stock, the continuation of our stock repurchase program and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Liberty Broadband, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of inflationary pressures) and market conditions conducive to stock repurchases. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Liberty Broadband expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Liberty Broadband, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Liberty Broadband and about the risks and uncertainties related to Liberty Broadband which may affect the statements made in this press release._\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Liberty Broadband (and certain of its subsidiaries) and GCI Holdings together with a reconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction costs, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring and impairment charges. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Liberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nLiberty Broadband believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business' performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Broadband views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Broadband’s management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the tables below for applicable reconciliations. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GCI’s operating income to its Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. \n\nGCI HOLDINGS ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24   \n---|---|---  \n**GCI Holdings Operating Income** |  **$** |  **30** |  **$** |  **42**  \nDepreciation and amortization  |  55  |  55   \nStock-based compensation  |  4  |  3   \n**GCI Holdings Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **89** |  **$** |  **100**  \n  \nSCHEDULE 2 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Broadband for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. \n\nLIBERTY BROADBAND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24   \n---|---|---  \n**Liberty Broadband Operating Income** |  **$** |  **21** |  **$** |  **30**  \nDepreciation and amortization  |  55  |  55   \nStock-based compensation  |  9  |  8   \n**Liberty Broadband Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **85** |  **$** |  **93**  \nGCI Holdings  |  $  |  89  |  $  |  100   \nCorporate and other  |  (4  |  )  |  (7  |  )   \n**LIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**amounts in millions,**  \n**except share amounts**  \n_Assets_  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  168  |  158   \nTrade and other receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $4 and $5, respectively  |  186  |  178   \nPrepaid and other current assets  |  63  |  94   \nTotal current assets  |  417  |  430   \nInvestment in Charter, accounted for using the equity method  |  12,760  |  12,116   \nProperty and equipment, net  |  1,131  |  1,053   \nIntangible assets not subject to amortization   \nGoodwill  |  755  |  755   \nCable certificates  |  550  |  550   \nOther  |  41  |  40   \nIntangible assets subject to amortization, net  |  423  |  461   \nOther assets, net  |  226  |  236   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  16,303  |  15,641   \n_Liabilities and Equity_  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities  |  $  |  112  |  86   \nDeferred revenue  |  30  |  30   \nCurrent portion of debt  |  3  |  3   \nOther current liabilities  |  56  |  59   \nTotal current liabilities  |  201  |  178   \nLong-term debt, net, including $1,876 and $1,255 measured at fair value, respectively  |  3,709  |  3,733   \nObligations under tower obligations and finance leases, excluding current portion  |  79  |  83   \nLong-term deferred revenue  |  93  |  65   \nDeferred income tax liabilities  |  2,342  |  2,216   \nPreferred stock  |  201  |  202   \nOther liabilities  |  140  |  141   \nTotal liabilities  |  6,765  |  6,618   \n_Equity_  \nSeries A common stock, $.01 par value.

Such sales are executed by Liberty Broadband monthly based on Charter’s repurchase activity in the month prior. \n\nFrom August 1, 2024 through October 31, 2024, Liberty Broadband sold 225 thousand shares of Charter Class A common stock to Charter for total proceeds of $74 million. \n\nBalance Sheet\n\nThe following presentation is provided to separately identify cash and liquid investments, debt and public holdings of Liberty Broadband as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. \n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  6/30/2024  |  9/30/2024   \n---|---|---  \n**Cash and Cash Equivalents:**  \nGCI Holdings  |  $  |  47  |  $  |  47   \nCorporate and Other  |  26  |  121   \n**Total Liberty Broadband Consolidated Cash** |  **$** |  **73** |  **$** |  **168**  \n**Fair Value of Public Holdings in Charter**(a) |  **$** |  **13,730** |  **$** |  **14,769**  \n**Debt:**  \nSenior Notes(b) |  $  |  600  |  $  |  600   \nSenior Credit Facility  |  443  |  423   \nTower Obligations and Other(c) |  88  |  87   \n**Total GCI Holdings Debt** |  **$** |  **1,131** |  **$** |  **1,110**  \nGCI Leverage(d) |  3.2x  |  3.1x   \nCharter Margin Loan  |  $  |  1,330  |  $  |  790   \n3.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2053(e) |  1,265  |  965   \n3.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2054(e) |  —  |  860   \n**Total Corporate Level Debt** |  **$** |  **2,595** |  **$** |  **2,615**  \n**Total Liberty Broadband Debt** |  **$** |  **3,726** |  **$** |  **3,725**  \nFair market value adjustment and deferred loan costs  |  (33  |  )  |  70   \nTower obligations and finance leases (excluded from GAAP Debt)  |  (84  |  )  |  (83  |  )   \n**Total Liberty Broadband Debt (GAAP)** |  **$** |  **3,609** |  **$** |  **3,712**  \n**Other Financial Obligations:**  \nPreferred Stock(f) |  180  |  180   \n  \n_______________________ \n\na) |  Represents fair value of the investment in Charter as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024.   \n---|---  \nb)  |  Principal amount of Senior Notes.   \nc)  |  Includes the Wells Fargo Note Payable and current and long-term obligations under tower obligations and finance leases.   \nd)  |  As defined in GCI's credit agreement.   \ne)  |  Principal amount of Exchangeable Senior Debentures exclusive of fair market value adjustments.   \nf)  |  Liquidation value of preferred stock.

The preferred stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes.   \n  \nLiberty Broadband cash increased $95 million in the third quarter primarily due to proceeds from Charter share sales. GCI cash was flat in the third quarter as cash from operations were offset by capital expenditures (net of grant proceeds) and net debt repayment. \n\nLiberty Broadband debt was relatively flat in the third quarter as net debt issuance at Liberty Broadband offset net debt repayment at GCI. On July 2, 2024, Liberty Broadband closed a private offering of $860 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% exchangeable senior debentures due 2054 and used net proceeds to repay $540 million of borrowings under the Charter margin loan, leaving $1.15 billion of available capacity under the Charter margin loan, and also repurchased $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.125% exchangeable senior debentures due 2053. GCI repaid $20 million under its senior credit facility in the third quarter. As of September 30, 2024, GCI’s credit facility has undrawn capacity of $367 million (net of letters of credit), and GCI’s leverage as defined in its credit agreement is 3.1x. \n\nGCI Operating and Financial Results\n\n3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change   \n---|---|---  \n_(amounts in millions, except operating metrics)_  \n**GCI Consolidated Financial Metrics**  \nRevenue   \nConsumer  |  $  |  114  |  $  |  116  |  2  |  %   \nBusiness  |  126  |  146  |  16  |  %   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  240  |  $  |  262  |  9  |  %   \nOperating income  |  $  |  30  |  $  |  42  |  40  |  %   \nOperating income margin (%)  |  12.5  |  %  |  16.0  |  %  |  350 bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA(a) |  $  |  89  |  $  |  100  |  12  |  %   \nAdjusted OIBDA margin(a) (%)  |  37.1  |  %  |  38.2  |  %  |  110 bps   \n**GCI Consumer**  \n**Financial Metrics**  \nRevenue   \nData  |  $  |  57  |  $  |  59  |  4  |  %   \nWireless  |  47  |  47  |  —  |  %   \nOther  |  10  |  10  |  —  |  %   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  114  |  $  |  116  |  2  |  %   \n**Operating Metrics**  \nData:   \nCable modem subscribers(b) |  159,300  |  156,400  |  (2  |  )%   \nWireless:   \nLines in service(c) |  200,300  |  200,300  |  —  |  %   \n**GCI Business**  \n**Financial Metrics**  \nRevenue   \nData  |  $  |  105  |  $  |  125  |  19  |  %   \nWireless  |  12  |  12  |  —  |  %   \nOther  |  9  |  9  |  —  |  %   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  126  |  $  |  146  |  16  |  %   \n  \n________________________ \n\na) |  See reconciling schedule 1.   \n---|---  \nb)  |  A cable modem subscriber is defined by the purchase of cable modem service regardless of the level of service purchased. If one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points, each access point is counted as a subscriber. Data cable modem subscribers as of September 30, 2024 include 900 subscribers that were reclassified from GCI Business to GCI Consumer subscribers in the first quarter of 2024 and are not new additions.   \nc)  |  A wireless line in service is defined as a wireless device with a monthly fee for services. Wireless lines in service as of September 30, 2024 include 1,800 lines that were reclassified from GCI Business to GCI Consumer lines in the first quarter of 2024 and are not new additions.   \n  \nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\nGCI revenue increased 9% in the third quarter. Consumer revenue increased 2% driven by growth in data revenue. Business revenue increased 16% driven by a strong upgrade cycle in schools and healthcare corporations in remote Alaska. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased $12 million and $11 million, respectively, in the third quarter in line with higher revenue, partially offset by increased operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses grew driven by higher distribution costs to healthcare, education and consumer customers. Selling, general and administrative expenses grew due to increases in labor-related and software subscription costs, partially offset by lower lease expense. \n\nIn the third quarter, GCI spent $39 million, net, on capital expenditures. Capital expenditure spending was related primarily to improvements to the wireless and data networks in rural Alaska. GCI's net capital expenditures for the full year 2024 are expected to be approximately $200 million related to additional high-returning investments in middle and last mile connectivity, with continued network expansion in GCI’s most important markets in rural Alaska including the Bethel and AU-Aleutians fiber projects. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Broadband will discuss these highlights and other matters on Liberty Broadband's earnings conference call that will begin at 11:15 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

Links to this press release and replays of the call will also be available on Liberty Broadband’s website. \n\n_This press release includes certain forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about business strategies, market potential, future financial prospects, capital expenditures, the proposed transaction with Charter and its expected benefits, matters relating to Liberty Broadband’s equity interest in Charter and Charter’s buyback of common stock, Liberty Broadband’s participation in Charter’s buyback of common stock, the continuation of our stock repurchase program and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Liberty Broadband, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of inflationary pressures) and market conditions conducive to stock repurchases. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Liberty Broadband expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Liberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction costs, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring and impairment charges. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Liberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nLiberty Broadband believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business' performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Broadband views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Broadband’s management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the tables below for applicable reconciliations. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GCI’s operating income to its Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. \n\nGCI HOLDINGS ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24   \n---|---|---  \n**GCI Holdings Operating Income** |  **$** |  **30** |  **$** |  **42**  \nDepreciation and amortization  |  55  |  55   \nStock-based compensation  |  4  |  3   \n**GCI Holdings Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **89** |  **$** |  **100**  \n  \nSCHEDULE 2 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Broadband for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. \n\nLIBERTY BROADBAND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24   \n---|---|---  \n**Liberty Broadband Operating Income** |  **$** |  **21** |  **$** |  **30**  \nDepreciation and amortization  |  55  |  55   \nStock-based compensation  |  9  |  8   \n**Liberty Broadband Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **85** |  **$** |  **93**  \nGCI Holdings  |  $  |  89  |  $  |  100   \nCorporate and other  |  (4  |  )  |  (7  |  )   \n**LIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**amounts in millions,**  \n**except share amounts**  \n_Assets_  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  168  |  158   \nTrade and other receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $4 and $5, respectively  |  186  |  178   \nPrepaid and other current assets  |  63  |  94   \nTotal current assets  |  417  |  430   \nInvestment in Charter, accounted for using the equity method  |  12,760  |  12,116   \nProperty and equipment, net  |  1,131  |  1,053   \nIntangible assets not subject to amortization   \nGoodwill  |  755  |  755   \nCable certificates  |  550  |  550   \nOther  |  41  |  40   \nIntangible assets subject to amortization, net  |  423  |  461   \nOther assets, net  |  226  |  236   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  16,303  |  15,641   \n_Liabilities and Equity_  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities  |  $  |  112  |  86   \nDeferred revenue  |  30  |  30   \nCurrent portion of debt  |  3  |  3   \nOther current liabilities  |  56  |  59   \nTotal current liabilities  |  201  |  178   \nLong-term debt, net, including $1,876 and $1,255 measured at fair value, respectively  |  3,709  |  3,733   \nObligations under tower obligations and finance leases, excluding current portion  |  79  |  83   \nLong-term deferred revenue  |  93  |  65   \nDeferred income tax liabilities  |  2,342  |  2,216   \nPreferred stock  |  201  |  202   \nOther liabilities  |  140  |  141   \nTotal liabilities  |  6,765  |  6,618   \n_Equity_  \nSeries A common stock, $.01 par value.

GCI cash was flat in the third quarter as cash from operations\nwere offset by capital expenditures (net of grant proceeds) and net debt repayment.\nLiberty Broadband debt was relatively flat in the third quarter as net debt issuance at Liberty\nBroadband offset net debt repayment at GCI. On July 2, 2024, Liberty Broadband closed a\nprivate offering of $860 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% exchangeable senior\ndebentures due 2054 and used net proceeds to repay $540 million of borrowings under the\nCharter margin loan, leaving $1.15 billion of available capacity under the Charter margin\nloan, and also repurchased $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.125%\nexchangeable senior debentures due 2053.

If one entity purchases multiple cable modem service\naccess points, each access point is counted as a subscriber. Data cable modem\nsubscribers as of September 30, 2024 include 900 subscribers that were reclassified from\nGCI Business to GCI Consumer subscribers in the first quarter of 2024 and are not new\nadditions.\nc)A wireless line in service is defined as a wireless device with a monthly fee for services.\nWireless lines in service as of September 30, 2024 include 1,800 lines that were\nreclassified from GCI Business to GCI Consumer lines in the first quarter of 2024 and are\nnot new additions.\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023.\nGCI revenue increased 9% in the third quarter. Consumer revenue increased 2% driven by\ngrowth in data revenue. Business revenue increased 16% driven by a strong upgrade cycle\nin schools and healthcare corporations in remote Alaska.\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased $12 million and $11 million, respectively,\nin the third quarter in line with higher revenue, partially offset by increased operating and\nselling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses grew driven by higher\ndistribution costs to healthcare, education and consumer customers. Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses grew due to increases in labor-related and software subscription\ncosts, partially offset by lower lease expense.\nIn the third quarter, GCI spent $39 million, net, on capital expenditures. Capital expenditure\nspending was related primarily to improvements to the wireless and data networks in rural\nAlaska. GCI's net capital expenditures for the full year 2024 are expected to be\napproximately $200 million related to additional high-returning investments in middle and last\nmile connectivity, with continued network expansion in GCI’s most important markets in rural\nAlaska including the Bethel and AU-Aleutians fiber projects.\nFOOTNOTES\n1)Liberty Broadband will discuss these highlights and other matters on Liberty Broadband's\nearnings conference call that will begin at 11:15 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

Links to this\npress release and replays of the call will also be available on Liberty Broadband’s website.\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements under the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about business strategies, market\npotential, future financial prospects, capital expenditures, the proposed transaction with\nCharter and its expected benefits, matters relating to Liberty Broadband’s equity interest in\nCharter and Charter’s buyback of common stock, Liberty Broadband’s participation in\nCharter’s buyback of common stock, the continuation of our stock repurchase program and\nother matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in\nmarket acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters\naffecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Liberty\nBroadband, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment\nopportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of inflationary pressures) and\nmarket conditions conducive to stock repurchases. These forward-looking statements speak\nonly as of the date of this press release, and Liberty Broadband expressly disclaims any\nobligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking\nstatement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband's expectations with\nregard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such\nstatement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Liberty Broadband,\nincluding the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Liberty\nBroadband and about the risks and uncertainties related to Liberty Broadband which may\naffect the statements made in this press release.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press\nrelease includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure,\nfor Liberty Broadband (and certain of its subsidiaries) and GCI Holdings together with a\nreconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under\nGAAP. Liberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction costs, separately\nreported litigation settlements, restructuring and impairment charges. Further, this press\nrelease includes Adjusted OIBDA margin which is also a non-GAAP financial measure.\nLiberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue.\nLiberty Broadband believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational\nstrength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a\nreflection of each business' performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In\naddition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical\ncomparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve\nperformance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance,\nLiberty Broadband views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAdjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP\nmeasure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with\nthe same information that Liberty Broadband’s management considers in assessing the\nresults of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the tables below for\napplicable reconciliations.\nSCHEDULE 1\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GCI’s operating income to its Adjusted\nOIBDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024.\nGCI HOLDINGS ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n(amounts in millions) 3Q23 3Q24\nGCI Holdings Operating Income $ 30 $ 42\nDepreciation and amortization 55 55\nStock-based compensation 4 3\nGCI Holdings Adjusted OIBDA $ 89 $ 100\nSCHEDULE 2\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of operating income (loss) calculated in\naccordance with GAAP to Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Broadband for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024.\nLIBERTY BROADBAND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n(amounts in millions) 3Q23 3Q24\nLiberty Broadband Operating Income $ 21 $ 30\nDepreciation and amortization 55 55\nStock-based compensation 9 8\nLiberty Broadband Adjusted OIBDA $ 85 $ 93\nGCI Holdings $ 89 $ 100\nCorporate and other (4) (7)\nLIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\n(unaudited)\nSeptember December\n30, 31,\n2024 2023\namounts in millions,\nexcept share amounts\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 168 158\nTrade and other receivables, net of allowance for credit losses\nof $4 and $5, respectively 186 178\nPrepaid and other current assets 63 94\nTotal current assets 417 430\nInvestment in Charter, accounted for using the equity method 12,760 12,116\nProperty and equipment, net 1,131 1,053\nIntangible assets not subject to amortization\nGoodwill 755 755\nCable certificates 550 550\nOther 41 40\nIntangible assets subject to amortization, net 423 461\nOther assets, net 226 236\nTotal assets $ 16,303 15,641\nLiabilities and Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 112 86\nDeferred revenue 30 30\n3 3\nCurrent portion of debt\nOther current liabilities 56 59\nTotal current liabilities\n201 178\nLong-term debt, net, including $1,876 and $1,255 measured at\nfair value, respectively 3,709 3,733\nObligations under tower obligations and finance leases,\nexcluding current portion 79 83\nLong-term deferred revenue 93 65\nDeferred income tax liabilities 2,342 2,216\nPreferred stock 201 202\nOther liabilities 140 141\nTotal liabilities 6,765 6,618\nEquity\nSeries A common stock, $.01 par value.
