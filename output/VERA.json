(Nasdaq: VERA) today announced that on November 18, 2024, the Compensation Committee of Vera’s Board of Directors granted inducement awards consisting of a non-qualified stock option to purchase 108,000 shares of Class A common stock and restricted stock units (RSUs) for 53,000 shares of Class A common stock to Jason S. Carter, Vera’s new Chief Legal Officer, under Vera’s 2024 Inducement Plan. The Compensation Committee approved the awards as an inducement material to the new employee’s employment in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\n\nThe stock option granted on November 18, 2024 has an exercise price per share equal to $44.81, Vera’s closing trading price on November 18, 2024. Each stock option will vest over four years, with 25% of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date and the balance of the underlying shares vesting monthly thereafter over 36 months, subject to the new employee’s continued service relationship with Vera through the applicable vesting dates. Each of the RSUs will vest over four years, with 25% of the underlying shares vesting on each anniversary of November 20, 2024, subject to the new employee’s continued service relationship with Vera through the applicable vesting dates. The awards are subject to the terms and conditions of the Inducement Plan and the terms and conditions of an applicable award agreement covering the grant.\n\n**About Vera** Vera Therapeutics is a late clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for serious immunological diseases. Vera’s mission is to advance treatments that target the source of immunological diseases in order to change the standard of care for patients. Vera’s lead product candidate is atacicept, a fusion protein self-administered as a subcutaneous injection once weekly that blocks both B-cell Activating Factor (BAFF) and A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL), which stimulate B cells and plasma cells to produce autoantibodies contributing to certain autoimmune diseases, including IgAN, also known as Berger’s disease, and lupus nephritis. In addition, Vera is evaluating additional diseases where the reduction of autoantibodies by atacicept may prove medically useful. Vera is also developing MAU868, a monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize infection with BK virus (BKV), a polyomavirus that can have devastating consequences in certain settings such as kidney transplant. Vera retains all global developmental and commercial rights to atacicept and MAU868.

Carter as Chief Legal Officer\n\nNovember 18, 2024 \n\n[Download PDF](/node/9551/pdf)\n\nBRISBANE, Calif., Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vera Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERA), a late clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative treatments for patients with serious immunological diseases, today announced the appointment of Jason S. Carter as Chief Legal Officer, effective immediately.\n\n“We are excited to have Jason join our growing team. With our pivotal ORIGIN 3 trial of atacicept in IgAN on track to announce topline results in the second quarter of 2025 and planned BLA submission to the FDA anticipated later in the year, pending data, we are actively building out our team with experienced professionals who will help us successfully enter our next phase as a company,” said Marshall Fordyce, M.D., Founder and CEO of Vera Therapeutics. “Jason brings a wealth of practical and strategic experience in supporting companies through regulatory approvals, commercialization, and intellectual property management.”\n\n“It is a privilege to join the Vera team and be part of the Company’s mission to bring safe and effective therapies to patients with high unmet needs,” commented Mr. Carter. “I look forward to supporting the advancement of Vera’s lead asset, atacicept, as a potential best-in-class disease-modifying treatment option for patients with IgAN, as well as a potential therapy for multiple other autoimmune kidney diseases.”\n\nMr. Carter brings over 20 years of experience as an attorney providing counsel to public and private companies across a wide spectrum of life sciences, biotechnology, and large pharmaceutical companies. Mr. Carter has recently served as Global Head of Legal for Kite Pharma, Inc., where he oversaw legal and compliance activities supporting global product launches, R&D activities, manufacturing innovation and expansion, high-impact IP litigation, and M&A transactions. Prior to Kite, Mr. Carter served in a variety of senior legal roles, including at Daiichi Sankyo, Novartis, and Baxter. Earlier in his career, Mr. Carter practiced as an M&A and corporate securities attorney with Jenner & Block, and Vorys, Sater, Seymour & Pease. Mr. Carter serves on the board of advisors for Family Reach/More Moments More Memories, a leading patient centered non-profit. Mr. Carter holds a J.D. from University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School and a bachelor’s degree in political science from Temple University.\n\n**About Vera** Vera Therapeutics is a late clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for serious immunological diseases. Vera’s mission is to advance treatments that target the source of immunological diseases in order to change the standard of care for patients. Vera’s lead product candidate is atacicept, a fusion protein self-administered as a subcutaneous injection once weekly that blocks both B-cell Activating Factor (BAFF) and A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL), which stimulate B cells to produce autoantibodies contributing to certain autoimmune diseases, including IgAN, also known as Berger’s disease, and lupus nephritis.

These cytokines are members of the tumor necrosis factor family that promote B-cell survival and autoantibody production associated with certain autoimmune diseases, including IgAN and lupus nephritis.\n\nThe Phase 2b ORIGIN clinical trial of atacicept in IgAN met its primary and key secondary endpoints, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful proteinuria reductions and stabilization of eGFR versus placebo through 36 weeks. The safety profile during the randomized period was comparable between atacicept and placebo. Through 96 weeks, atacicept demonstrated further reductions in Gd-IgA1, hematuria, and proteinuria, as well as stabilization of eGFR reflecting a profile consistent with that of the general population without IgAN.\n\nAtacicept has received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of IgAN, which reflects the FDA’s determination that, based on an assessment of data from the Phase 2b ORIGIN clinical trial, atacicept may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available therapies for patients with IgAN. Vera believes atacicept is positioned for best-in-class potential, targeting B cells to reduce autoantibodies and having been administered to more than 1,500 patients in clinical studies across different indications.\n\n**Forward-looking Statements** _Statements contained in this press release regarding matters, events or results that may occur in the future are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among other things, atacicept’s potential to be a disease-modifying treatment option for patients with IgAN, as well as a potential therapy for multiple other autoimmune kidney diseases and Vera’s expectations regarding timing of data presentations and regulatory submissions.

Words such as “will,” “may”, “plan,” “on track,” “potential” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon Vera’s current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect.
