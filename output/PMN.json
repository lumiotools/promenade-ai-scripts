(Nasdaq: PMN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the generation and development of antibody therapeutics targeting toxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We made significant progress in the third quarter, highlighted by the positive results from our first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 and the closing of a strong equity financing that could provide up to $122.7 million to advance our pipeline of neurodegenerative product candidates,” said Neil Warma, CEO of ProMIS Neurosciences. “Results from our Phase 1a study showed that PMN310 was generally safe and well-tolerated and achieved concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicating its potential for target engagement in AD patients. Additionally, these results have confirmed the dosing levels for the planned multiple ascending dose Phase 1b clinical trial in 100 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and early AD, which is on track to start by the end of 2024.”\n\n“These early clinical outcomes reinforce our confidence in PMN310's unique therapeutic profile and the impact it may have on AD patients, their families, and healthcare providers,” added Mr. Warma. “As toxic oligomers are recognized as key drivers of AD progression, we believe PMN310’s selective binding to these oligomers differentiates it from other drugs currently on the market or in development and strengthens the case for its continued advancement and positioning as a promising option in the AD treatment landscape.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n**Alzheimer’s Disease Program (PMN310)**\n\nProMIS’ lead candidate, PMN310, is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed toward toxic amyloid-beta (Ab) oligomers (AβO) that are believed to be a major driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\n\n  * The Phase 1a clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy normal volunteers ([NCT06105528](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06105528?term=PMN310-101&rank=1 \"Opens in a new window\")). The trial consisted of five single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts and was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK), of intravenous doses of PMN310. The trial completed enrollment of all 40 subjects across two active sites in the United States. The trial was initiated based on encouraging nonclinical studies of PMN310 that support the selective targeting of AβOs. \n  * In October 2024, ProMIS presented positive data from all five cohorts in its first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 in healthy volunteers at the 17th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference, which took place from October 29 – November 1, 2024, in Madrid, Spain. The results showed PMN310 was generally well-tolerated in all five SAD cohorts (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) of the Phase 1a clinical trial and, importantly, crossed the blood brain barrier in healthy volunteers in a dose dependent manner with PK suggesting that monthly dosing may provide levels of PMN310 adequate for target engagement in AD patients. The complete dataset from all five cohorts reinforces previously reported data from the first four cohorts of the Phase 1a trial [announced](https://www.promisneurosciences.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/225/promis-neurosciences-reports-positive-top-line-data-from \"Opens in a new window\") in July 2024. \n  * ProMIS is on-track to initiate its PMN310 Phase 1b clinical trial by year-end 2024. \n\n\n\nProMIS continues to advance its Ab vaccine program in AD based on its oligomer target epitope(s).\n\n  * In July 2024, the Company presented preclinical data in a poster at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC), which took place from July 29-August 1, 2024, in Philadelphia. The poster titled, “Novel approach to optimization of Alzheimer’s vaccine configuration for maximal targeting of toxic amyloid-beta oligomers,” highlighted data demonstrating that maximal reactivity was observed with immune IgG against the monovalent vaccine containing epitope 301, the target of PMN310. \n\n\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Program (PMN267)**\n\nPMN267 is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed against toxic misfolded TDP-43 as a potential therapeutic target for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n  * In August 2024, ProMIS announced the publication of two papers highlighting the role of toxic misfolded superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) aggregates in the pathogenesis of ALS. One paper published in _Acta Neuropathologica_ is titled, “Seeding activity of human superoxide dismutase 1 aggregates in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis postmortem neural tissues by real-time quaking-induced conversion,” and the other paper published in the online journal, _Open Biology,_ is titled, “Amyloidogenic regions in beta-strands II and III modulate the aggregation and toxicity of SOD1 in living cells.” The _Acta Neuropathologica_ publication can be accessed [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-024-02752-8 \"Opens in a new window\"), and the _Open Biology_ publication can be accessed [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.230418 \"Opens in a new window\"). \n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * In July 2024, ProMIS completed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing that may provide up to $122.7 million in gross proceeds, which includes an initial upfront funding of $30.3 million and up to $92.4 million tied to exercise of warrants based on the Company achieving certain milestones. The PIPE financing included participation from new and existing healthcare specialist investors such as Great Point Partners, LLC, Armistice Capital, Ally Bridge Group, Sphera Healthcare, and other institutional and individual accredited investors. Proceeds from the private placement are expected to be used to advance the clinical development of PMN310, as well as for working capital and other general corporate expenses. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $21.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $12.6 million as of December 31, 2023. During the quarter, the Company completed a PIPE financing that provided initial upfront funding of $30.3 million, and which has the potential to provide an additional $92.4 million tied to the potential exercise of warrants. \n  * Research and development expenses were $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to costs related to the execution of the PMN310 Phase 1a clinical trial and preparation for the PMN310 Phase 1b clinical trial. \n  * General and administrative expenses increased to $1.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2023. \n  * Net income was $9.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liabilities of $17.0 million. \n\n\n\n**About ProMIS Neurosciences Inc.**\n\nProMIS Neurosciences Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on generating and developing antibody therapeutics selectively targeting toxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).

The study consisted of five single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts and was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravenous doses of PMN310. The five dosing cohorts were 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg. The decision to escalate dosing was made by a data safety monitoring board based on analysis of safety data. Serum PMN310 concentrations were collected before, and at the end of the infusion and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 72, 192 hours and approximately biweekly after infusion. CSF collection was done at day 3 and day 29 after dosing to determine CSF concentration of PMN310.

Soluble AβOs have been observed to be potent neurotoxins that bind to neurons, inhibit synaptic function and induce neurodegeneration. By selectively targeting toxic soluble AβOs, PMN310 aims to directly address the growing body of evidence suggesting that they represent a primary underlying cause of the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n**About ProMIS Neurosciences Inc.**\n\nProMIS Neurosciences Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on generating and developing antibody therapeutics selectively targeting toxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).

(Nasdaq: PMN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the generation and development of antibody therapeutics targeting toxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We made significant progress in the third quarter, highlighted by the positive results from our first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 and the closing of a strong equity financing that could provide up to $122.7 million to advance our pipeline of neurodegenerative product candidates,” said Neil Warma, CEO of ProMIS Neurosciences. “Results from our Phase 1a study showed that PMN310 was generally safe and well-tolerated and achieved concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicating its potential for target engagement in AD patients. Additionally, these results have confirmed the dosing levels for the planned multiple ascending dose Phase 1b clinical trial in 100 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and early AD, which is on track to start by the end of 2024.”\n\n“These early clinical outcomes reinforce our confidence in PMN310's unique therapeutic profile and the impact it may have on AD patients, their families, and healthcare providers,” added Mr. Warma. “As toxic oligomers are recognized as key drivers of AD progression, we believe PMN310’s selective binding to these oligomers differentiates it from other drugs currently on the market or in development and strengthens the case for its continued advancement and positioning as a promising option in the AD treatment landscape.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n**Alzheimer’s Disease Program (PMN310)**\n\nProMIS’ lead candidate, PMN310, is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed toward toxic amyloid-beta (Ab) oligomers (AβO) that are believed to be a major driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\n\n  * The Phase 1a clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy normal volunteers ([NCT06105528](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06105528?term=PMN310-101&rank=1 \"Opens in a new window\")). The trial consisted of five single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts and was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK), of intravenous doses of PMN310. The trial completed enrollment of all 40 subjects across two active sites in the United States. The trial was initiated based on encouraging nonclinical studies of PMN310 that support the selective targeting of AβOs. \n  * In October 2024, ProMIS presented positive data from all five cohorts in its first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 in healthy volunteers at the 17th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference, which took place from October 29 – November 1, 2024, in Madrid, Spain. The results showed PMN310 was generally well-tolerated in all five SAD cohorts (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) of the Phase 1a clinical trial and, importantly, crossed the blood brain barrier in healthy volunteers in a dose dependent manner with PK suggesting that monthly dosing may provide levels of PMN310 adequate for target engagement in AD patients. The complete dataset from all five cohorts reinforces previously reported data from the first four cohorts of the Phase 1a trial [announced](https://www.promisneurosciences.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/225/promis-neurosciences-reports-positive-top-line-data-from \"Opens in a new window\") in July 2024. \n  * ProMIS is on-track to initiate its PMN310 Phase 1b clinical trial by year-end 2024. \n\n\n\nProMIS continues to advance its Ab vaccine program in AD based on its oligomer target epitope(s).\n\n  * In July 2024, the Company presented preclinical data in a poster at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC), which took place from July 29-August 1, 2024, in Philadelphia. The poster titled, “Novel approach to optimization of Alzheimer’s vaccine configuration for maximal targeting of toxic amyloid-beta oligomers,” highlighted data demonstrating that maximal reactivity was observed with immune IgG against the monovalent vaccine containing epitope 301, the target of PMN310. \n\n\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Program (PMN267)**\n\nPMN267 is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed against toxic misfolded TDP-43 as a potential therapeutic target for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n  * In August 2024, ProMIS announced the publication of two papers highlighting the role of toxic misfolded superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) aggregates in the pathogenesis of ALS. One paper published in _Acta Neuropathologica_ is titled, “Seeding activity of human superoxide dismutase 1 aggregates in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis postmortem neural tissues by real-time quaking-induced conversion,” and the other paper published in the online journal, _Open Biology,_ is titled, “Amyloidogenic regions in beta-strands II and III modulate the aggregation and toxicity of SOD1 in living cells.” The _Acta Neuropathologica_ publication can be accessed [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-024-02752-8 \"Opens in a new window\"), and the _Open Biology_ publication can be accessed [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.230418 \"Opens in a new window\"). \n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * In July 2024, ProMIS completed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing that may provide up to $122.7 million in gross proceeds, which includes an initial upfront funding of $30.3 million and up to $92.4 million tied to exercise of warrants based on the Company achieving certain milestones. The PIPE financing included participation from new and existing healthcare specialist investors such as Great Point Partners, LLC, Armistice Capital, Ally Bridge Group, Sphera Healthcare, and other institutional and individual accredited investors. Proceeds from the private placement are expected to be used to advance the clinical development of PMN310, as well as for working capital and other general corporate expenses. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $21.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $12.6 million as of December 31, 2023. During the quarter, the Company completed a PIPE financing that provided initial upfront funding of $30.3 million, and which has the potential to provide an additional $92.4 million tied to the potential exercise of warrants. \n  * Research and development expenses were $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to costs related to the execution of the PMN310 Phase 1a clinical trial and preparation for the PMN310 Phase 1b clinical trial. \n  * General and administrative expenses increased to $1.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2023. \n  * Net income was $9.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liabilities of $17.0 million. \n\n\n\n**About ProMIS Neurosciences Inc.**\n\nProMIS Neurosciences Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on generating and developing antibody therapeutics selectively targeting toxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).

(Nasdaq: PMN), a clinical-stage biotechnology\ncompany focused on the generation and development of antibody therapeutics targeting\ntoxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD),\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), today announced\nfinancial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate\nupdate.\n“We made significant progress in the third quarter, highlighted by the positive results from\nour first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 and the closing of a strong equity\nfinancing that could provide up to $122.7 million to advance our pipeline of\nneurodegenerative product candidates,” said Neil Warma, CEO of ProMIS Neurosciences.\n“Results from our Phase 1a study showed that PMN310 was generally safe and well-\ntolerated and achieved concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicating its potential\nfor target engagement in AD patients. Additionally, these results have confirmed the dosing\nlevels for the planned multiple ascending dose Phase 1b clinical trial in 100 patients with\nmild cognitive impairment due to AD and early AD, which is on track to start by the end of\n2024.”\n“These early clinical outcomes reinforce our confidence in PMN310's unique therapeutic\nprofile and the impact it may have on AD patients, their families, and healthcare providers,”\nadded Mr. Warma. “As toxic oligomers are recognized as key drivers of AD progression, we\nbelieve PMN310’s selective binding to these oligomers differentiates it from other drugs\ncurrently on the market or in development and strengthens the case for its continued\nadvancement and positioning as a promising option in the AD treatment landscape.”\nRecent Highlights\nAlzheimer’s Disease Program (PMN310)\nProMIS’ lead candidate, PMN310, is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed toward toxic\namyloid-beta (Ab) oligomers (AβO) that are believed to be a major driver of Alzheimer’s\ndisease (AD).\nThe Phase 1a clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in\nhealthy normal volunteers (NCT06105528). The trial consisted of five single-ascending\ndose (SAD) cohorts and was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and\npharmacokinetics (PK), of intravenous doses of PMN310. The trial completed\nenrollment of all 40 subjects across two active sites in the United States. The trial was\ninitiated based on encouraging nonclinical studies of PMN310 that support the\nselective targeting of AβOs.\nIn October 2024, ProMIS presented positive data from all five cohorts in its first-in-\nhuman Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 in healthy volunteers at the 17th Clinical\nTrials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference, which took place from October 29 –\nNovember 1, 2024, in Madrid, Spain. The results showed PMN310 was generally well-\ntolerated in all five SAD cohorts (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) of the Phase 1a clinical\ntrial and, importantly, crossed the blood brain barrier in healthy volunteers in a dose\ndependent manner with PK suggesting that monthly dosing may provide levels of\nPMN310 adequate for target engagement in AD patients. The complete dataset from\nall five cohorts reinforces previously reported data from the first four cohorts of the\nPhase 1a trial announced in July 2024.\nProMIS is on-track to initiate its PMN310 Phase 1b clinical trial by year-end 2024.\nProMIS continues to advance its Ab vaccine program in AD based on its oligomer target\nepitope(s).\nIn July 2024, the Company presented preclinical data in a poster at the Alzheimer’s\nAssociation International Conference (AAIC), which took place from July 29-August 1,\n2024, in Philadelphia. The poster titled, “Novel approach to optimization of Alzheimer’s\nvaccine configuration for maximal targeting of toxic amyloid-beta oligomers,”\nhighlighted data demonstrating that maximal reactivity was observed with immune IgG\nagainst the monovalent vaccine containing epitope 301, the target of PMN310.\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Program (PMN267)\nPMN267 is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed against toxic misfolded TDP-43 as a\npotential therapeutic target for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nIn August 2024, ProMIS announced the publication of two papers highlighting the role\nof toxic misfolded superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) aggregates in the pathogenesis of\nALS. One paper published in Acta Neuropathologica is titled, “Seeding activity of\nhuman superoxide dismutase 1 aggregates in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis postmortem neural tissues by real-time quaking-induced conversion,” and the\nother paper published in the online journal, Open Biology, is titled, “Amyloidogenic\nregions in beta-strands II and III modulate the aggregation and toxicity of SOD1 in\nliving cells.” The Acta Neuropathologica publication can be accessed here, and the\nOpen Biology publication can be accessed here.\nCorporate\nIn July 2024, ProMIS completed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing\nthat may provide up to $122.7 million in gross proceeds, which includes an initial\nupfront funding of $30.3 million and up to $92.4 million tied to exercise of warrants\nbased on the Company achieving certain milestones. The PIPE financing included\nparticipation from new and existing healthcare specialist investors such as Great Point\nPartners, LLC, Armistice Capital, Ally Bridge Group, Sphera Healthcare, and other\ninstitutional and individual accredited investors. Proceeds from the private placement\nare expected to be used to advance the clinical development of PMN310, as well as for\nworking capital and other general corporate expenses.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\nCash and cash equivalents were $21.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to\n$12.6 million as of December 31, 2023.
