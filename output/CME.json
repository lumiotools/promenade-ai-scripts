Some web browsers, such as [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/) and [Safari RSS](http://www.apple.com/safari/), have RSS readers built in. There are also online aggregators, websites such as [My Yahoo](http://my.yahoo.com/) or [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) that allow you to customize them by adding RSS feeds.

the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights and our ability to operate our business without violating the\nintellectual property rights of others; decreases in revenue from our market data as a result of decreased demand or changes to regulations in various jurisdictions; changes in our rate per contract due to shifts in the mix of the\nproducts traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure;

For a detailed discussion and additional information concerning these and other factors that might affect our performance, see our other recent periodic\nfilings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2024, under the caption “Risk Factors”.\nCertain Terms\nAll references to “options” or “options contracts” in the text of this document refer to options on futures contracts.\nAny mention of products or services that have yet to be launched are pending regulatory review.\nInformation about Contract Volume and Average Rate Per Contract\nAll amounts regarding contract volume and average rate per contract are for CME Group’s listed futures and options on futures contracts unless otherwise noted.\nTo supplement CME Group’s financial statements on a GAAP basis, this document includes financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP, consisting of non-GAAP net income and earnings per share. Management believes\nthat the presentation of non-GAAP net income and earnings per share provide important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to CME Group’s financial condition and\nresults of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provide a better measure of comparability with the company’s prior financial reports. Management acknowledges that non-GAAP\nadjustments may include recurring items. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A\nreconciliation of the non-GAAP financial results mentioned to the respective GAAP figures can be found at the end of each quarter’s CME Group financial statements.\nCME GROUP PUBLIC © 2024 CME Group.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore\nis not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material\nmisstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS\nChicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (the exchange or CME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME Group Inc. (CME Group), is a\ndesignated contract market (DCM) for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. CME offers a wide range of\nproducts including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange and agricultural commodities. Trades are executed\nthrough electronic trading platforms, open outcry and privately negotiated transactions. CME is also a derivatives clearing\norganization (DCO). CME offers clearing, settlement, and guarantees for all products cleared through the company and its\naffiliates. CME also provides clearing and other services to non-affiliated third-parties. CME serves as a swap execution\nfacility, which is a regulated platform for swap trading, and serves as a swap data repository, which provides public data on\nswap transactions and stores confidential swap data for regulatory purposes.\nConsolidated CME also includes NEX Services North America (NEX Services), which a provides shared technology and other\nadministrative services to affiliates of CME Group. CME and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as \"the company\" or\n\"CME\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts on the consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management\nbelieves are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may\ndiffer\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three\nmonths or less at the time of purchase.\nFinancial Investments. The company maintains short-term marketable securities, classified as trading securities. Trading\nsecurities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans are recorded at fair value, with net realized and\nunrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income.\nThe company reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary.\nIf events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of the assets has occurred and is deemed to represent indicators\nof impairment, the carrying value of the investments is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment is charged to\nearnings.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that\nestablishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and\njudgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments.\nThe company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes:\n• Level 1 inputs, which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value, consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) for\nidentical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2 inputs consist of observable market data, other than level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.\n• Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other\nentity-specific inputs.\nAccounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable\nare stated at net realizable value. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by\nclearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, our credit loss\nexposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The company retains the right to\nliquidate exchange memberships to satisfy an outstanding receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based\non management's assessment of future expected losses over the life of the receivable, historical trends and the current economic\nenvironment within which we operate.\n9\nPerformance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for\nclearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits.\nPerformance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held\nby a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, investments in highly\nrated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest\nearned on these investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of income.\nCME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of\nthe cash collateral and the benefits and market risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund\ncontributions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. The cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are\nconsidered restricted cash as the cash deposits cannot be used for the company's operations or to satisfy any operational\nliabilities.\nSecurities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds,\ncorporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in\nsafekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty\nfund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash\nperformance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty. Property is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are\ncalculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to nineteen years. Property and equipment are depreciated over\ntheir estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective\nlease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and\nexternal costs incurred in developing, obtaining, or implementing computer software for internal use which meet the\nrequirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two\nto four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives.\nLeases. The company accounts for our leases of office space as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a direct\nreduction to the capitalized lease asset, which is reported in other assets and amortized to rent expense over the term of the\nlease. Both lease and direct non-lease costs are accounted for as a single lease component for purposes of capitalization on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.The associated lease liability represents the present value of lease payments remaining in the lease\nterm and is recorded within current and other liabilities depending upon the balance sheet classification of the payment\nobligations as short-term or long-term. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease\narrangement based on the company's conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred and\nrecognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on\nthe consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation. A\nportion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and a portion is recognized as interest\nexpense based on an imputed interest rate.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net\nassets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill for impairment at least quarterly and whenever\nevents or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively\nfor impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a\nreporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash\nflows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and\nassumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair\nvalue, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of\nimpairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value.\nBusiness Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires\nthe acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the\nacquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in\ndetermining the estimated fair values.\nEmployee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans on its consolidated\nbalance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan\nassets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior\nservice costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nForeign Currency Accounting. Foreign denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using\nperiod-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of income.\n10\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below:\nClearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing,\ntrading on the company's electronic trading platforms, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation,\nand other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading\nprivileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. The majority of our clearing and transaction fees are\nrecognized as revenue upon successful execution of the trade. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no\nimpact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing\nfirm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed\nby the company, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments\nto reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of\nadjustments processed as well as management's estimate of future adjustment activity. The company believes the reserve\nis adequate to cover estimated adjustments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nMarket Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the\ndissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by\nvendors or over a straight line basis in accordance with the market data subscription contract term. The company\nconducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion,\ncustomers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues include access and communication fees, fees for collateral management, equity\nmembership subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as\nwell as other services to customers. Revenue is recognized as services are provided.\nMarketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing\nactivities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are\nexpensed when the first broadcast occurs.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and\nliabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized.\nThe company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The\ncompany recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nNewly Adopted Accounting Policies. The company did not adopt new accounting policies in 2023. The company also does\nnot currently expect any pending accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES\nThe company transacts business in the normal course of operations with affiliates including its parent and entities under\ncommon ownership control. Affiliates include, but are not limited to, CME Group, Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc.\n(CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX).\nFees from affiliates. CME receives fees from affiliates for shared operational and administrative services including, but not\nlimited to, clearing and transaction processing; data distribution; network and infrastructure connectivity and maintenance;\nmarketing, and staffing resources. In 2023 and 2022, CME recognized fees from affiliates of $832.2 million and $670.6 million,\nrespectively.\nFees to affiliates. CME pays a fee to various affiliates for marketing, software development and market data services. In 2023\nand 2022, CME recognized fees to affiliates of $357.1 million and $296.4 million, respectively. These expenses were included\nin other expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\nAllocation of stock-based compensation expense. CME employees receive stock option, restricted stock awards and\nperformance shares under CME Group's stock-based incentive plans. Stock-based compensation costs related to stock-based\nincentives received by CME's employees are recorded as compensation expense with an offset to additional paid-in capital in\nshareholder's equity.\nAllocation of income taxes. CME is included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of its parent, CME\nGroup. Income tax expense is allocated to members of the consolidated group based on a separate entity basis and presented on\na separate entity basis as well.\nAmounts due from and to affiliates. Amounts due from and to affiliates represent unsecured receivables and payables for\nshared services and income taxes.\n11\nAt December 31, 2023, amounts due from (to) affiliates consisted of the following:\n(in millions) Shared Services Income Taxes Total Due from Affiliates Due to Affiliates Total\nCME Group $ 7.1 $ (99.3) $ (92.2) $ — $ (92.2) $ (92.2)\nCBOT 69.7 — 69.7 69.7 — 69.7\nNYMEX 56.8 — 56.8 56.8 — 56.8\nCME Operations\nLimited (36.5) — (36.5) — (36.5) (36.5)\nOther affiliates 9.7 — 9.7 45.8 (36.1) 9.7\nTotal $ 106.8 $ (99.3) $ 7.5 $ 172.3 $ (164.8) $ 7.5\nAt December 31, 2022, amounts due from (to) affiliates consisted of the following:\n(in millions) Shared Services Income Taxes Total Due from Affiliates Due to Affiliates Total\nCME Group $ 5.8 $ (79.3) $ (73.5) $ — $ (73.5) $ (73.5)\nCBOT 73.7 — 73.7 73.7 — 73.7\nNYMEX 79.1 — 79.1 79.1 — 79.1\nCME Operations\nLimited (55.7) — (55.7) — (55.7) (55.7)\nOther affiliates 23.5 — 23.5 51.9 (28.4) 23.5\nTotal $ 126.4 $ (79.3) $ 47.1 $ 204.7 $ (157.6) $ 47.1\nIntercompany debt. CME and CME Group have entered into an intercompany bilateral loan agreement in which each entity\nmay make loans to the other entity. The agreement will expire in December 2024. The outstanding loan receivable or payable\namount cannot exceed $750.0 million and can be voluntarily prepaid. Interest accrued based on the prime rate, which was 7.5%\nto 8% during the period in 2023 that the loan was outstanding and is payable quarterly or in connection with a voluntary\nprepayment. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no outstanding loan receivables under this agreement.\nNEX Services and CME Group maintained an intercompany bilateral loan agreement in which each entity may make loans to\nthe other entity. The agreement expired in November 2022. The outstanding loan receivable or payable amount cannot exceed\n$75.0 million and can be voluntarily prepaid. Interest accrued based on the prime rate, which was 3.25% to 6.25% during 2022\nand was payable quarterly or in connection with a voluntary prepayment. At December 31, 2022 there was no outstanding loan\nreceivable under this agreement.\nCME also maintains an intercompany committed line of credit agreement with CME Group. CME may use the proceeds for its\ngeneral operating expenses and those of its subsidiaries. The line of credit provides for borrowings of up to $500.0 million. The\nagreement will expire in December 2024. The company has the option to request an increase in the line of credit from $500.0\nmillion up to $600.0 million. During 2023 and 2022, the company did not borrow against this facility.\n4. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. The majority of revenue consists of clearing and transaction fees:\nClearing and transaction fees. Clearing and transaction fees include electronic trading fees and brokerage commissions,\nsurcharges for privately-negotiated transactions, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation and other\nvolume-related charges for trade contracts. Clearing and transaction fees are assessed upfront at the time of trade execution. As\nsuch, the company recognizes the majority of the fee revenue upon successful execution of the trade. The minimal remaining\nportion of the fee revenue related to settlement activities performed after trade execution is recognized over the short-term\nperiod that the contract is outstanding, based on management’s estimates of the average contract lifecycle. These estimates are\nbased on various assumptions to approximate the amount of fee revenue to be attributed to services performed through contract\nsettlement, expiration, or termination. For cleared trades, these assumptions include the average number of days that a contract\nremains in open interest, contract turnover, average revenue per day, and revenue remaining in open interest at the end of each\nperiod.\nThe nature of contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including volume-based pricing tiers, customer\nincentives associated with market maker programs and other fee discounts. The company includes fee discounts and incentives\nin the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee reduction. These estimates\nare based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and best judgment at the time. Because of the company's certainty\nin estimating these amounts, they are included in the transaction price of contracts.\n12\nMarket data and information services. Market data and information services represent revenue from the dissemination of\nmarket data to subscribers, distributors, and other third-party licensees of market data. Pricing for market data is primarily based\non the number of reportable devices used as well as the number of subscribers enrolled under the arrangement. Fees for these\nservices are generally billed monthly. Market data services are satisfied over time and revenue is recognized on a monthly basis\nas the customers receive and consume the benefit of the market data services. However, the company also maintains certain\nannual license arrangements with one-time upfront fees. The fees for annual licenses are initially recorded as a contract liability\nand recognized as revenue monthly over the term of the annual period.\nOther. Other revenues include certain access and communication fees, fees for collateral management, equity membership\nsubscription fees, and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships. Access and\ncommunication fees are charged to customers that utilize various telecommunications networks and communications services.\nFees for these services are generally billed monthly and the associated fee revenue is recognized as billed. Collateral\nmanagement fees are charged to clearing firms that have collateral on deposit with the clearing house to meet their minimum\nperformance bond and guaranty fund obligations on the exchange. These fees are calculated based on daily collateral balances\nand are billed monthly. This fee revenue is recognized monthly as billed as the customers receive and consume the benefits of\nthe services. The company also has an equity membership program which provides equity members the option to substitute a\nmonthly subscription fee for their existing requirement to hold CME Group Class A common stock. Choosing to pay this fee in\nlieu of holding Class A shares is entirely voluntary and the client's choice. Fee revenue under this program is earned monthly as\nbilled over the contractual term. Pricing for strategic relationships may be driven by customer levels and activity. There are fee\narrangements which provide for monthly as well as quarterly payments in arrears. Revenue is recognized monthly for strategic\nrelationship arrangements as the customers receive and consume the benefits of the services.\nThe following table represents a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers by timing for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nServices transferred at a point in time $ 1,837.1 $ 1,697.3\nServices transferred over time 1,383.9 1,124.2\nOne-time charges and miscellaneous revenues 8.4 15.1\nTotal revenues $ 3,229.4 $ 2,836.6\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, and customer advances\nand deposits (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain fees for transactions, annual licenses, and other\nrevenue arrangements are billed upfront before revenue is recognized, which results in the recognition of contract liabilities.\nThese liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis upon commencement of\nservices under the customer contract. These upfront customer payments are recognized as revenue over time as the obligations\nunder the contracts are satisfied. Changes in the contract liability balances during 2023 were not materially impacted by any\nother factors. The balance of contract liabilities was $9.5 million and $8.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n5. PERFORMANCE BONDS AND GUARANTY FUND CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe clearing house clears and guarantees the settlement of contracts traded in the futures and options and interest rate swap\nmarkets. In its guarantor role, the clearing house has precisely equal and offsetting claims to and from clearing firms on\nopposite sides of each contract, standing as an intermediary on every contract cleared. In the U.S., clearing firm funds are held\naccording to Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulatory account segregation standards. To the extent that\nfunds are not otherwise available to satisfy an obligation under the applicable contract, the clearing house bears counterparty\ncredit risk in the event that future market movements create conditions that could lead to clearing firms failing to meet their\nobligations to the clearing house. The clearing house reduces the exposure through risk management programs that include\ninitial and ongoing financial standards for designation as a clearing firm, performance bond requirements, daily mark-to-\nmarket, mandatory guaranty fund contributions and intra-day monitoring.\nEach clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain balances in the form of cash, U.S. government securities, certain foreign\ngovernment securities, bank letters of credit or other approved collateral to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund\nrequirements. All non-cash deposits and certain cash deposits with foreign currency exposure are marked-to-market and haircut\non a daily basis. Securities deposited by the clearing firms are not reflected on the consolidated financial statements and the\nclearing house does not earn any interest on these deposits. These balances may fluctuate significantly over time due to\ninvestment choices available to clearing firms and changes in the amount of contributions required.\n13\nThe clearing house marks-to-market open positions at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts), and\nrequires payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions\nhave gained value. The clearing house has the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant.\nUnder the extremely unlikely scenario of simultaneous default by every clearing firm who has open positions with unrealized\nlosses, the maximum exposure at the time of default related to positions other than interest rate swap contracts would be one\nhalf day of changes in fair value of all open positions, before considering the clearing house's ability to access defaulting\nclearing firms' collateral deposits. For cleared interest rate swap contracts, the maximum exposure at the time of default related\nto the clearing house's guarantee would be one full day of changes in fair value of all open positions, before considering the\nclearing house's ability to access defaulting clearing firms' collateral. During 2023, the clearing house transferred an average of\napproximately $5.9 billion a day through the clearing system for settlement from clearing firms whose positions had lost value\nto clearing firms whose positions had gained value. The clearing house reduces its exposure through maintenance performance\nbond requirements and guaranty fund contributions. For futures and options products, the clearing firms' collateral requirements\nare sized to cover at least one day of anticipated price movements. For cleared swap products, the clearing firms' collateral\nrequirements are sized to cover at least five days of anticipated price movements. Management has assessed the fair value of the\ncompany's settlement guarantee liability by taking the following factors into consideration: the design and operations of the\nclearing risk management process, the financial safeguard packages in place, historical evidence of default by a clearing\nmember and the estimated probability of potential payouts by the clearing house. Based on the assessment performed,\nmanagement estimates the guarantee liability to be nominal and therefore has not recorded any liability at December 31, 2023.\nCME has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and\nis authorized to maintain cash accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the clearing\nhouse maintained $79.3 billion and $124.9 billion, respectively, within the cash accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago. The cash deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is included within performance bonds and guaranty fund\ncontributions on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCME and The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) have a perpetual cross-margin arrangement, whereby a clearing firm may\nmaintain a cross-margin account in which a clearing firm's positions in certain equity index futures and options are combined\nwith certain positions cleared by OCC for purposes of calculating performance bond requirements. The performance bond\ndeposits are held jointly by CME and OCC. Cross-margin cash, securities and letters of credit jointly held with OCC under the\ncross-margin agreement are reflected at 50% of the total, or CME's proportionate share per that agreement. If a participating\nfirm defaults, the gain or loss on the liquidation of the firm's open position and the proceeds from the liquidation of the cross\nmargin account would be allocated equally between CME and OCC. In the event of a remaining loss, CME would first apply\nassets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund\ncontributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for clearing membership and any\nassociated trading rights. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, the clearing house would use its corporate\ncontributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. The clearing house would then use guaranty fund\ncontributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an\nassessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.\nIn addition, CME has a cross-margin arrangement with Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) whereby certain of the\nclearing firms' offsetting positions with CME and FICC are subject to reduced performance bond requirements. Clearing firms\nmaintain separate performance bond deposits with each clearing house, but based on the net offsetting positions between CME\nand FICC, each clearing house may reduce that firm's performance bond requirements. If a participating firm defaults, the gain\nor loss on the liquidation of the firm’s open positions and the proceeds from the liquidation of the cross margin account would\nbe allocated between CME and FICC pursuant to a publicly-available cross-margining agreement. In the event of a remaining\nloss, CME would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the\ndefaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for\nclearing membership and any associated trading rights. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, the clearing\nhouse would use its corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. The clearing house\nwould then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds\ncollected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the\ndeficit.\nEach clearing firm for futures and options is required to deposit and maintain specified guaranty fund contributions in the form\nof cash or U.S. Treasury securities (base guaranty fund). In the event that performance bonds, guaranty fund contributions and\nother assets required to support clearing membership of a defaulting clearing firm are inadequate to fulfill that clearing firm's\noutstanding financial obligation, the base guaranty fund for contracts other than interest rate swaps is available to cover\npotential losses after first utilizing $100.0 million of corporate contributions designated by CME to be used in the event of a\ndefault of a clearing firm for the base guaranty fund.\n14\nThe clearing house maintains a separate guaranty fund to support the clearing firms that clear interest rate swap products\n(cleared interest rate swaps contract guaranty fund). The funds for interest rate swaps are independent of the base guaranty fund\nand are isolated to clearing firms for products in the respective asset class. Each clearing firm for cleared interest rate swaps is\nrequired to deposit and maintain specified guaranty fund contributions in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities. In the\nevent that performance bonds, guaranty fund contributions and other assets required to support clearing membership of a\ndefaulting clearing firm for cleared interest rate swap contracts are inadequate to fulfill that clearing firm's outstanding financial\nobligation, the interest rate swaps contracts guaranty fund is available to cover potential losses after first utilizing $150.0\nmillion of corporate contributions designated by CME to be used in the event of a default of a cleared interest rate swap\nclearing firm.\nCME maintains a 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in\ncertain situations by the clearing house. CME may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a\nclearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral), or in the event\nof a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between CME\nand its clearing firms. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well\nas the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. The line of credit provides for\nborrowings of up to $7.0 billion. At December 31, 2023, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility were\n$8.6 billion. CME has the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion, subject to the approval of\nparticipating banks. In addition to the 364-day fully secured, committed multi-currency line of credit, the company also has the\noption to use the $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for the clearing house in the\nunlikely event of default.\nThe clearing house is required under the Commodity Exchange Act in the U.S. to segregate cash and securities deposited by\nclearing firms from its clearing member customers. In addition, the clearing house requires segregation of all funds deposited\nby its clearing firms from operating funds.\nCash and non-cash deposits held as performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions at fair value at December 31 were as\nfollows:\n2023 2022\nNon-Cash Non-Cash\nDeposits Deposits\nand and\n(in millions) Cash IEF Funds (1) Cash IEF Funds (1)\nPerformance bonds $ 87,285.5 $ 180,866.3 $ 132,653.7 $ 94,127.2\nGuaranty fund contributions 2,379.6 6,849.6 2,450.3 5,026.0\nCross-margin arrangements 183.1 1,374.5 142.6 561.1\nPerformance bond collateral for delivery (2) 344.0 2.1 2.3 2.1\nTotal $ 90,192.2 $ 189,092.5 $ 135,248.9 $ 99,716.4\n(1) IEF funds include customer-directed investments in IEF funds that are not included on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Other includes collateral for delivery and accrued interest earned on collateral reinvestment due to the clearing firms.\nCross-margin arrangements include collateral for the cross-margin accounts with OCC and FICC.\nCash performance bonds may include intraday settlement, if any, that is owed to the clearing firms and paid the following\nbusiness day. The balance of intraday settlements was $237.5 million and $436.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Intraday settlements may be invested on an overnight basis and are offset by an equal liability owed to clearing\nfirms.\nIn addition to cash, securities and other non-cash deposits, irrevocable letters of credit may be used as performance bond\ndeposits for clearing firms. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 these letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets, were as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nPerformance bonds $ 3,916.7 $ 4,674.3\nPerformance bond collateral for delivery 4,631.4 3,445.0\nTotal Letters of Credit $ 8,548.1 $ 8,119.3\nAll cash, securities and letters of credit posted as performance bonds are only available to meet the financial obligations of that\nclearing firm to the clearing house.\n15\n6. PROPERTY\nA summary of the property accounts at December 31 is presented below:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 Estimated Useful Life\nBuilding and building improvements 130.7 131.9 1 - 10 years\nLeasehold improvements 52.0 132.5 3 - 19 years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 307.8 411.3 2 - 7 years\nSoftware and software development costs 568.0 603.8 2 - 4 years\nTotal property 1,058.5 1,279.5\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (726.3) (916.0)\nProperty, net $ 332.2 $ 363.5\n7. DEBT\nCME maintains a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international\nbanks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. CME may\nuse the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to\nCME Clearing, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), in the event of a\ntemporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our\nclearing firms, or in other cases as provided by the CME rulebook. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the\nform of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets (pursuant to the CME rulebook) can be used to\ncollateralize the facility. At December 31, 2023, guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled $8.6 billion. We\nhave the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Throughout 2023 and 2022, the company did\nnot borrow any funds against this facility. However, in order to ensure that the facility would operate as intended, CME\nperiodically draws down nominal amounts of funds against the line of credit and immediately repays the amounts borrowed.\nThe 364-day multi-currency line of credit contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible\nnet worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the line of credit\nagreement) of not less than $800.0 million. At December 31, 2023, CME is in compliance with the covenant requirement. In\naddition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, CME also has the option to use CME Group's $2.3 billion multi-currency\nrevolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for clearing operations in the unlikely event of default in certain\ncircumstances. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity\nfor our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion.\n8. INCOME TAXES\nThe income tax provision consisted of the following for the years ended December 31. The company is subject to regulation\nunder a wide variety of federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations.\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 360.6 $ 297.6\nState 102.6 86.6\nForeign 1.9 1.1\nTotal 465.1 385.3\nDeferred:\nFederal (24.7) (17.5)\nState (6.9) (5.7)\nTotal (31.6) (23.2)\nTotal Income Tax Provision $ 433.5 $ 362.1\n16\nReconciliation of the U.S. federal income tax rate (statutory tax rate) to the effective tax rate is as follows:\n2023 2022\nStatutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 4.1 4.3\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction (1.5) (1.4)\nOther, net (0.3) 0.5\nEffective Tax Rate 23.3 % 24.4 %\nIn 2023 and 2022, the effective tax rates were higher than the statutory tax rate due to the impact of state taxes, partially offset\nby the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction.\nAt December 31, net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nDeferred Income Tax Assets:\nNet operating losses $ — $ 1.3\nAccrued expenses, compensation, leases and other 114.1 112.2\nSubtotal 114.1 113.5\nValuation allowance — (0.4)\nTotal deferred income tax assets 114.1 113.1\nDeferred Income Tax Liabilities:\nProperty (20.2) (48.1)\nOther (38.6) (42.2)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities (58.8) (90.3)\nNet Deferred Income Tax Assets $ 55.3 $ 22.8\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, net non-current deferred income tax assets were included in other assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nA valuation allowance is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets may\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable\nincome of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions.\nAt December 31, 2023, the company had no gross domestic and foreign income tax loss carry forwards. At December 31, 2022,\nthe company had gross domestic and foreign income tax loss carry forwards $6.2 million. At December 2022, the company has\ndetermined that a portion of the net operating loss deferred tax assets were not more-likely-than-not to be realized and a\nvaluation allowance of $0.4 million was provided.\nThe following is a summary of the company’s unrecognized tax benefits:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nGross unrecognized tax benefits $ 104.9 $ 110.2\nUnrecognized tax benefits, net of tax impacts in other jurisdictions 100.0 104.2\nUnrecognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 5.8 9.6\nInterest and penalties recognized in the consolidated statements of income (0.5) (0.9)\nThe company does not believe it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months, unrecognized tax benefits will\nchange by a significant amount.\n17\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nBalance at January 1 $ 110.2 $ 122.8\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 4.2 3.3\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years 1.1 1.0\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (1.5) (1.5)\nSettlements with taxing authorities (7.6) (14.7)\nReductions as a result of lapse of statutes of limitations (1.5) (0.7)\nBalance at December 31 $ 104.9 $ 110.2\nThe company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes in Illinois and other state and foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, substantially all federal income tax matters have been concluded through 2013 and state income tax\nmatters have been concluded through 2018.\n9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nPension Plan. CME maintains a non-contributory defined benefit cash balance pension plan for eligible employees. CME's\nplan provides for a pay-based credit added to the cash balance account based on age and earnings and includes salary and cash\nbonuses in the definition of earnings. Employees who have completed a continuous 12-month period of employment and have\nreached the age of 21 are eligible to participate. Participant cash balance accounts receive an interest credit equal to the greater\nof the one-year constant maturity yield for U.S. Treasury notes or 4.0%. Participants become vested in their accounts after three\nyears of service. The measurement date used for the plan is December 31.\nThe following is a summary of the change in projected benefit obligation:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nBalance at January 1 $ 316.4 $ 386.0\nService cost 21.1 25.7\nInterest cost 18.5 12.0\nActuarial (gain) loss 18.3 (86.7)\nBenefits paid (22.8) (20.6)\nBalance at December 31 $ 351.5 $ 316.4\nThe accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $323.2 million and $294.4 million, respectively.\nThe following is a summary of the change in the fair value of plan assets:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nBalance at January 1 $ 331.7 $ 402.3\nActual return on plan assets 38.9 (50.0)\nEmployer contributions 3.0 —\nBenefits paid (22.8) (20.6)\nBalance at December 31 $ 350.8 $ 331.7\n18\nThe plan assets are classified into a fair value hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to\neach asset or liability’s fair value measurement. Valuation techniques for level 2 assets use significant observable inputs such as\nquoted prices for similar assets, quoted market prices in inactive markets and other inputs that are observable or can be\nsupported by observable market data. The fair value of each major category of plan assets as of December 31 is indicated\nbelow.\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nLevel 2:\nMoney market funds $ 6.2 $ 16.6\nMutual funds:\nFixed income 165.3 131.6\nU.S. equity 131.6 129.8\nForeign equity 47.7 53.7\nTotal $ 350.8 $ 331.7\nAt December 31, 2023, the fair value of pension plan assets had a shortfall of the projected benefit obligation by $0.7 million\nand the shortfall was recorded as a non-current pension liability in other liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of\npension plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation by $15.3 million and the excess was recorded as a non-current\npension asset in other assets.\nCME's funding goal is to have its pension plan 100% funded at each year-end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also\nsatisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Year-end 2023 assumptions have\nbeen used to project the assets and liabilities from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The company anticipates based\non this projection that an additional contribution of $16.9 million in 2024 will be necessary for it to meet its funding goal.\nHowever, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on the plan\nassets during 2024 and the December 31, 2024 discount rate.\nThe components of net pension expense and the assumptions used to determine the end-of-year projected benefit obligation and\nnet pension expense in aggregate are indicated below:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nComponents of Net Pension Expense:\nService cost $ 21.1 $ 25.7\nInterest cost 18.5 12.0\nExpected return on plan assets (21.6) (22.3)\nRecognized net actuarial loss 0.3 1.4\nNet Pension Expense $ 18.3 $ 16.8\nAssumptions Used to Determine End-of-Year Benefit Obligation:\nDiscount rate 5.20 % 5.60 %\nRate of compensation increase 4.00 4.00\nCash balance interest crediting rate 5.14 4.75\nAssumptions Used to Determine Net Pension Expense:\nDiscount rate 5.60 % 3.00 %\nRate of compensation increase 4.00 4.00\nExpected return on plan assets 6.75 5.75\nInterest crediting rate 4.75 4.00\nThe discount rate for the plan was determined based on the market value of a theoretical settlement bond portfolio. This\nportfolio consisted of U.S. dollar denominated Aa-rated corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. A single equivalent\ndiscount rate was determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with that settlement value. The resulting\ndiscount rate was reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.\nThe basis for determining the expected rate of return on plan assets for the plan is comprised of three components: historical\nreturns, industry peers and forecasted return. The plan's total return is expected to equal the composite performance of the\nsecurity markets over the long term. The security markets are represented by the returns on various domestic and international\n19\nstock, bond and commodity indexes. These returns are weighted according to the allocation of plan assets to each market and\nmeasured individually.\nThe overall objective of the plan is to achieve required long-term rates of return in order to meet future benefit payments. The\ncomponent of the investment policy for the plan that has the most significant impact on returns is the asset mix. The asset mix\nhas a minimum and maximum range depending on asset class. The plan assets are diversified to minimize the risk of large\nlosses by any one or more individual assets. Such diversification is accomplished, in part, through the selection of asset mix and\ninvestment management. The asset allocation for the plan, by asset category, at December 31 was as follows:\n2023 2022\nFixed income 47.1 % 39.7 %\nMoney market funds 1.8 5.0\nU.S. equity 37.5 39.1\nForeign equity 13.6 16.2\nFor 2024, management expects the fixed income asset class to be approximately 50% of the portfolio. The target allocation for\nthe equity asset classes is expected to be approximately 50% of the portfolio.\nAt times, the company may determine that it is necessary to place some assets in cash equivalent investments in order to pay\nexpected plan liabilities. Given this, the actual asset allocation for the plan may not fall within the target allocation ranges from\ntime to time.\nAccording to the plan's investment policy, the plan is not allowed to invest in securities that compromise independence, short\nsales of securities directly owned by the plan, securities purchased on margin or other uses of borrowed funds, derivatives not\nused for hedging purposes, restricted stock or illiquid securities or any other transaction prohibited by employment laws. If the\nplan directly invests in short-term and long-term debt obligations, the investments are limited to obligations rated at the highest\nrating category by Standard & Poor's (S&P) or Moody's.\nThe pre-tax balance and activity of the prior service costs and actuarial losses for the pension plan, which are included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss), for 2023 are as follows:\n(in millions) Actuarial Loss\nBalance at January 1 $ 32.2\nUnrecognized net loss 1.1\nRecognized as a component of net pension expense (0.3)\nBalance at December 31 $ 33.0\nAt December 31, 2023, anticipated benefit payments from the plan in future years are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2023 $ 32.1\n2024 32.5\n2025 33.8\n2026 34.5\n2027 35.2\n2028-2032 182.6\nSavings Plan. CME maintains a defined contribution savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code,\nwhereby all U.S. employees are participants and have the option to contribute to this plan. CME matches employee\ncontributions up to 3% of the employee's base salary and may make additional discretionary contributions. Total expense for\nthe savings plan was $8.0 million and $7.6 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNon-Qualified Plans. CME maintains non-qualified plans, under which participants may make assumed investment choices\nwith respect to amounts contributed on their behalf. Although not required to do so, CME invests such contributions in assets\nthat mirror the assumed investment choices. The balances in these plans are subject to the claims of general creditors of the\ncompany and totaled $91.3 million and $75.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Although the value of the\nplans is recorded as an asset in marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets, there is an equal and offsetting liability.\n20\nThe investment results of these plans have no impact on net income as the investment results are recorded in equal amounts to\nboth investment income and compensation and benefits expense.\nSupplemental Savings Plan. CME maintains a supplemental plan to provide benefits for employees who have been impacted by\nstatutory limits under the provisions of the qualified pension and savings plan. Employees in this plan are subject to the vesting\nrequirements of the underlying qualified plans.\nDeferred Compensation Plan. A deferred compensation plan is maintained by CME, under which eligible officers and members\nof the board of directors may contribute a percentage of their compensation and defer income taxes thereon until the time of\ndistribution.\n10. LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS\nLeases. The company has operating leases for datacenters and corporate offices. The operating leases have remaining lease\nterms of up to 9 years, some of which include options to extend or renew the leases for up to an additional five years, and some\nof which include options to early terminate the leases in less than 12 months. Management evaluates the exercisability of these\noptions at least quarterly in order to determine whether the contract term must be reassessed. For a small number of the leases,\nprimarily the international locations, management's approach is to enter into short-term leases for a lease term of 12 months or\nless in order to provide for greater flexibility in the local environment. For certain office spaces, the company has entered into\narrangements to sublease excess space to third parties, while the original lease contract remains in effect with the landlord.\nThe company also has one finance lease, which is related to the sale of our datacenter in March 2016. In connection with the\nsale, the company leased back a portion of the property. The sale leaseback transaction was recognized under the financing\nmethod and not as a sale leaseback arrangement.\nThe right-of-use lease asset is recorded within other assets, and the present value of the lease liability is recorded within other\nliabilities (segregated between short-term and long-term) on the consolidated balance sheets. The discount rate applied to the\nlease payments represents the company's incremental borrowing rate. The company has elected to utilize the short-term lease\nexception as prescribed in the leasing standard, such that the company has not capitalized on the balance sheet a lease asset or\nlease liability for leasing arrangements with a contractual term of 12 months or less from the lease commencement date.\nThe components of lease costs were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nOperating lease expense:\nOperating lease cost $ 26.1 $ 26.2\nTotal operating lease expense included in other expense $ 26.1 $ 26.2\nFinance lease expense:\nInterest expense $ 2.5 $ 2.8\nDepreciation expense 8.7 8.7\nTotal finance lease expense $ 11.2 $ 11.5\nSublease revenue included in other revenue $ 8.2 $ 8.2\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows for years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nCash outflows for operating leases $ 34.0 $ 32.9\nCash outflows for finance leases 17.2 17.1\n21\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nOperating leases\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 133.1 $ 151.0\nOperating lease liabilities:\nOther current liabilities $ 20.3 $ 25.7\nOther liabilities 183.1 203.4\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 203.4 $ 229.1\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in months) 102 112\nWeighted average discount rate 3.9 % 3.9 %\nFinance leases\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nFinance lease right-of-use assets $ 62.8 $ 71.5\nFinance lease liabilities:\nOther current liabilities $ 8.4 $ 8.2\nOther liabilities 59.4 67.8\nTotal finance lease liabilities $ 67.8 $ 76.0\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in months) 87 99\nWeighted average discount rate 3.5 % 3.5 %\nFuture minimum lease payments were as follows as of December 31, 2023 for operating and finance leases:\n(in millions) Operating Leases\n2024 27.7\n2025 28.0\n2026 28.5\n2027 26.3\n2028 25.6\nThereafter 103.5\nTotal lease payments 239.6\nLess: imputed interest (36.2)\nPresent value of lease liability $ 203.4\n22\n(in millions) Finance Lease\n2024 17.4\n2025 17.5\n2026 17.6\n2027 17.8\n2028 17.9\nThereafter 41.0\nTotal lease payments 129.2\nLess: imputed interest (61.4)\nPresent value of lease liability $ 67.8\nOther Commitments.

CONTINGENCIES\nLegal and Regulatory Matters. In the normal course of business, the company discusses matters with its regulators raised during\nregulatory examinations or otherwise subject to their inquiry and oversight. These matters could result in censures, fines,\npenalties or other sanctions. Management believes the outcome of any resulting actions will not have a material impact on the\ncompany's consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, the company is unable to predict the outcome or\nthe timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or the potential fines, penalties or injunctive or other equitable relief, if\nany, that may result from these matters.\nA putative class action complaint was filed January 15, 2014 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, against\nCME Group Inc. and the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. The plaintiffs, certain Class B shareholders of CME Group\nand Class B members of CBOT, allege breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for\nviolations of their core rights granted in the defendants’ respective Certificates of Incorporation. On December 2, 2021, the\ncourt granted the plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a damages-only class. No trial date has been set. Given the uncertainty of\nfactors that may potentially affect the resolution of the matter, at this time the company is unable to estimate the reasonably\npossible loss or range of reasonably possible losses in the unlikely event it were found to be liable at trial. Based on its\ninvestigation to date, the company believes that it has strong factual and legal defenses to the claims.\nIn addition, the company is a defendant in, and has potential for, various other legal proceedings arising from its regular\nbusiness activities. While the ultimate results of such proceedings against the company cannot be predicted with certainty, the\ncompany believes that the resolution of any of these matters on an individual or aggregate basis will not have a material impact\non its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nNo accrual was required for contingent legal and regulatory matters as none were probable and estimable as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nIntellectual Property Indemnifications. Certain agreements with customers and other third parties related to accessing the CME\nGroup platforms, utilizing market data services and licensing CME SPAN software may contain indemnifications from\nintellectual property claims that may be made against them as a result of their use of the applicable products and/or services.\nThe potential future claims relating to these indemnifications cannot be estimated and therefore no liability has been recorded.\n23\n12. GUARANTEES\nMutual Offset Agreement. CCME and Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) maintain a mutual offset agreement with a current\nterm through May 2024. This agreement enables market participants to open a futures position on one exchange and liquidate it\non the other. The term of the agreement will automatically renew for a one-year period after May 2024 unless either party\nprovides advance notice of its intent to terminate. CME can maintain collateral in the form of irrevocable, standby letters of\ncredit. At December 31, 2023, CME was contingently liable to SGX on irrevocable letters of credit totaling $285.0 million.\nCME also maintains a $350.0 million line of credit to meet its obligations under this agreement. Regardless of the collateral,\nCME guarantees all cleared transactions submitted through SGX and would initiate procedures designed to satisfy these\nfinancial obligations in the event of a default, such as the use of performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions of the\ndefaulting clearing firm. Management has assessed the fair value of the company's guarantee liability under this mutual offset\nagreement by taking the following factors into consideration: the design and operations of the clearing risk management\nprocess, the financial safeguard packages in place, historical evidence of default by a clearing member and the estimated\nprobability of potential payouts by the clearing house. Based on the assessment performed, management estimates the guarantee\nliability to be nominal and therefore has not recorded any liability at December 31, 2023.\nFamily Farmer and Rancher Protection Fund. In 2012, the company established the Family Farmer and Rancher Protection\nFund (the Fund). The Fund is designed to provide payments, up to certain maximum levels, to family farmers, ranchers and\nother agricultural industry participants who use the company's agricultural products and who suffer losses to their segregated\naccount balances due to their CME clearing member becoming insolvent. Under the terms of the Fund, farmers and ranchers are\neligible for up to $25,000 per participant. Farming and ranching cooperatives are eligible for up to $100,000 per cooperative.\nThe Fund has an aggregate maximum payment amount of $100.0 million. Since its establishment, the Fund has made payments\nof approximately $2.0 million, which leaves $98.0 million available for future claims. If payments to participants were to\nexceed this amount, payments would be pro-rated. Clearing members and customers must register in advance with the company\nand provide certain documentation in order to substantiate their eligibility. The company believes that its guarantee liability is\nnominal and therefore has not recorded any liability at December 31, 2023.\n13.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nLevel 1 assets generally include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices. In general, the\ncompany uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine the fair value of marketable securities. If quoted\nprices are not available to determine fair value, the company uses other inputs that are directly observable.\n24\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were classified in\ntheir entirety based on the lowest level of input that was significant to each asset or liability's fair value measurement.\nAt December 31, 2023\n(in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets at Fair Value:\nMarketable Securities:\nMutual funds $ 91.3 $ — $ — $ 91.3\nTotal Marketable Securities 91.3 — — 91.3\nTotal Assets at Fair Value $ 91.3 $ — $ — $ 91.3\nAt December 31, 2022\n(in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets at Fair Value:\nMarketable Securities:\nMutual funds $ 75.5 $ — $ — $ 75.5\nTotal Marketable Securities 75.5 — — 75.5\nTotal Assets at Fair Value $ 75.5 $ — $ — $ 75.5\nThere were no level 3 assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis during 2023 and 2022.\nThere were also no level 3 assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2023.\n15. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nCME is regulated by the CFTC as a DCO and a DCM. DCOs and DCMs are required to maintain capital as defined by the\nCFTC in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of\ncredit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME is in compliance with the DCO and DCM financial\nrequirements.\n16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe company has evaluated subsequent events through March 20, 2024, the date the financial statements were available to be\nissued, and has determined that there were no subsequent events that required disclosure.\n25"
