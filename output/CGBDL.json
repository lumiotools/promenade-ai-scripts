Given substantial overlap in strategy and portfolio composition, combining CGBD and CSL III into a single, larger, and more liquid vehicle will result in significant stockholder value creation and an enhanced investor experience. We are confident in this transaction’s potential to drive greater trading volume, access to an expanded stockholder base, and lower operating and financing costs. There is strong momentum across our direct lending franchise, and we believe bringing CGBD and CSL III together will enable us to build on that momentum.\n\n[Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc.
