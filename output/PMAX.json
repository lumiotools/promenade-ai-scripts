(NASDAQ: POWL), a leading supplier of custom-engineered solutions for the management, control and distribution of electrical energy, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 ended September 30, 2024. All comparisons are to the comparable periods of fiscal 2023, unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Fourth Quarter Key Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenues totaled $275 million, an increase of 32%;\n  * Gross profit of $80 million, or 29.2% of revenue;\n  * Net income of $46 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, increased 74%;\n  * New orders(1) totaled $267 million;\n  * Backlog(2) as of September 30, 2024 remained at $1.3 billion;\n  * Cash and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 totaled $358 million.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Key Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenues totaled $1.0 billion, an increase of 45%;\n  * Gross profit of $273 million, or 27.0% of revenue;\n  * Net income of $150 million, or $12.29 per diluted share, increased 175%;\n  * Net new orders totaled $1.1 billion.\n\n\n\nBrett A. Cope, Powell’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Powell delivered a strong fourth quarter performance that closed out another incredible year for the Company. We experienced tremendous growth in our largest markets, with our top line growing by 45% in fiscal 2024. We continue to execute at a high standard for both our customers and our shareholders as reflected by our gross margin, which improved 590 basis points compared to the prior year. Having recorded our second consecutive year of more than $1.0 billion in new orders, we continue to grow in our traditional markets of oil & gas, petrochemical and electrical utilities, while further diversifying in markets such as data centers, hydrogen, carbon capture and other alternative fuels. I’m incredibly proud of the Powell team for their performance in fiscal 2024 and their unwavering commitment to our customers and mission.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nRevenues totaled $275.1 million, an increase of 32% compared to $208.6 million in the prior year, and a 5% decline compared to $288.2 million in the third quarter. The increase compared to the prior year was mainly driven by the Petrochemical sector, which increased 112% to $50.4 million, and the Oil & Gas sector, which grew 23% to $115.4 million. In addition, revenues within the Commercial & Other Industrial sector improved 66% to $48.3 million.\n\nGross profit of $80.4 million, or 29.2% of revenue, increased 55% compared to the prior year of $52.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, and compares to $81.7 million, or 28.4% of revenue, in the third quarter. The increase in gross margin was predominantly driven by the higher volume levels across all of Powell’s manufacturing facilities generating favorable volume leverage, strong project execution, and continuing efforts to improve factory efficiencies while also managing product pricing that corresponds to current cost levels.\n\nNew orders totaled $267 million compared to $171 million in the prior year and $356 million in the third quarter. The growth compared to the prior year was driven by strong order activity across the Company’s Oil & Gas and Petrochemical sectors as well as the Electric Utility sector.\n\nBacklog totaled $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, essentially remaining the same as the backlog at both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Net income of $46.1 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, increased 74% compared to $26.4 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, in the prior year and was essentially flat compared to $46.2 million, or $3.79 per diluted share, in the third quarter.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues totaled $1.0 billion, an increase of 45% compared to $699.3 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by growth within the Company’s Oil & Gas and Petrochemical sectors, which grew 53% and 97%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2023. Additionally, revenues within the Commercial & Other Industrial and Electric Utility sectors increased 44% and 18%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nGross profit of $273.1 million, or 27.0% of revenues, increased 85% compared to $147.6 million, or 21.1% of revenues, in fiscal 2023. The improvement in gross margin was driven by the same factors mentioned above.\n\nNet new orders totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2023. The decline was mainly due to the inclusion of three large megaprojects in the Company’s Oil & Gas and Petrochemical sectors in fiscal 2023.\n\nNet income of $149.8 million, or $12.29 per diluted share, increased 175% compared to $54.5 million, or $4.50 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023.\n\nCope added, “We are entering fiscal 2025 with strong backlog and remain focused on the continued execution of our strategic priorities. We expect modest manufacturing capacity upgrades to be completed during the middle of fiscal 2025, which will help to facilitate organic growth within our targeted markets. It is becoming increasingly clear that the supply of electrical energy will grow significantly over the next several years to meet rising global demand. As an industry leader in handling the supply, control, and distribution of electrical energy, we are well-positioned to leverage our more than 75 years of expertise to bring custom-engineered solutions to our key markets.”\n\n**OUTLOOK**\n\nCommenting on the Company's outlook, Michael Metcalf, Powell’s Chief Financial Officer, said, “As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect continued strength across most of our end markets spanning across all of the geographies that we compete in. We are pleased with our fiscal 2024 results and remain focused on carrying forward the strong operational execution and commercial momentum that we have experienced this year, into fiscal 2025. Notwithstanding our seasonally slower fiscal first quarter, considering the healthy backdrop, robust backlog, strong liquidity, and a solid balance sheet, we anticipate that fiscal 2025 will be another successful year for Powell.”\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nPowell Industries has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, November 20, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
