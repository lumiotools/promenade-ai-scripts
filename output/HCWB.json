(“HCWB” or “HCW Biologics”), (NASDAQ: HCWB), a U.S.-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between inflammation and age-related diseases, and WY Biotech Co., Ltd., a China-based company specializing in the early-stage development of recombinant protein drugs and gene/cell therapies, announced today that they have entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement to develop and commercialize one of HCWB’s product candidates generated with its new drug discovery platform for therapeutic use.\n\nKey terms of the agreement include that WY Biotech has agreed to pay HCWB $7.0 million in an upfront payment, and HCWB is eligible to receive additional significant development milestone payments and double-digit royalties on future product sales. In addition, HCWB will share a substantial portion of the proceeds from a future transaction(s) involving the molecule, if such a transaction occurs. HCWB also has a payment-free, milestone-free, and royalty-free option to recapture the development and commercialization rights of this molecule for the United States, Canada, Central America, and South America (Opt-in Territory) after the conclusion of the Phase 1 clinical trial. WY Biotech is financially responsible for all costs associated with research and development, manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization for the molecule. HCWB will be responsible for costs associated with clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization in the Opt-in Territory, if HCWB exercises its opt-in rights. Both companies will work cooperatively in the development stage with a global focus for clinical development and partnering.\n\n“HCW Biologics’ strategic focus has been to establish commercialization partnerships for its novel protein and antibody therapies with innovative leaders in the immunotherapy field,” stated Dr. Hing C. Wong, HCWB’s Founder and CEO. “To this end, we have leveraged our in-depth knowledge of T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immunology and our brand-new proprietary drug discovery platform technologies to develop a portfolio of three classes of potent immunotherapeutics: Class I: Multi-Functional Immune Cell Stimulators; Class II: Second-Generation Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Multi-Specific Targeting Fusions; and Class III: Enhanced Immune Cell Engagers. We have developed molecules in each of these classes for treatments of hematologic and solid tumors, virally infected cells, and cellular senescence diseases associated with ageing. The product candidate subject to the license with WY Biotech combines several different immune functional domains on our new protein scaffold platform as part of our Class I portfolio. Our preclinical studies demonstrated that this multi-functional product candidate is highly effective at inducing anti-tumor CD8+ T cell and NK cell responses without triggering unwanted side effects in relevant solid tumor animal models. It appears to be one of the most potent immunostimulatory agents we have developed in over 30 years of biotech research and should combine well with other therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, immune cell engagers, therapeutic antibodies, and CAR-T therapies. We are very excited that WY Biotech recognizes the potential and value of this preclinical Class I molecule for human therapy. We are very much looking forward to collaborating with them on the clinical and commercial development of this novel approach.”\n\n**About HCW Biologics:**\n\nHCW Biologics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between chronic, low-grade inflammation, and age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases, as well as other inflammatory conditions such as long-haul COVID-19.

(the “Company” or “HCW Biologics”) (NASDAQ: HCWB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between inflammation and age-related diseases, today reported financial results and recent business highlights for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nDr. Hing C. Wong, Founder and CEO of HCW Biologics, stated, “In the third quarter 2024, the Company expanded our product portfolio and possible disease indications that may be treated with our immunotherapeutic compounds, consisting of compounds constructed using two different platforms. Our expanded portfolio now includes constructs with immune-cell engagers targeting tissue factor and other cell-surface antigens associated with diseased cells and multifunctional immunotherapeutic fusions which improve the performance of immune checkpoint inhibitors.”\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * We filed the IND application to obtain approval from the FDA to evaluate HCW9302 in an autoimmune indication and we are currently progressing through the review process. HCW9302 is a category-defining immunotherapeutic designed to activate and expand regulatory T cells, which deactivate inflammasomes. The novel design results in an immunotherapeutic with the therapeutic advantages of IL-2 but that is well tolerated. We believe that these studies support the clinical development of HCW9302 as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of a broad range of proinflammatory diseases. Our clinical development focus is autoimmune diseases, including alopecia areata, and neurodegenerative diseases. \n  * We launched our financing plan in the third quarter of 2024 with the conclusion of an arbitration that has hampered our ability to raise capital and complete business development transactions. In addition to equity financings, the Company has a strategic focus on business development transactions and establishing commercialization partnerships with innovative leaders in the immunotherapy field. On November 13, 2024, the Company engaged Maxim Group to act as the exclusive placement agent to execute a multi-step equity financing strategy.\n  * On September 25, 2024, the Company entered into a nonbinding term sheet with a well-known leader in immunology. Definitive agreements are being finalized with a closing expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The proposed license agreement includes substantial guaranteed minimum payments which are expected within the first year of the term. The license is for a preclinical molecule created with our novel protein platform, and we consider this a validation of the potential and value of this preclinical molecule for human therapy.\n  * The Company has developed a new drug discovery platform with a novel protein-based scaffold. It has already used this novel protein scaffold to construct several immunotherapeutic fusions, for development by HCW Biologics or others. The clinical development plan assumes one or more molecules constructed with this novel platform to be in clinical development in 2026, either through a Company-owned program or through the clinical program of one of the Company's licensees.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenues:** Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $853,102 and $426,423, respectively. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $1.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Revenues in both periods were derived exclusively from the sale of licensed molecules to the Company’s licensee, Wugen. The licensed molecules are one of the components used in manufacturing Wugen’s products.\n  * **Research and development (R &D) expenses: **R&D expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $1.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, a decrease of $480,529, or 29%. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred comparatively higher clinical expenses than it did in the comparable period in 2024, due to two ongoing clinical trials to evaluate HCW9218 in cancer. Similarly, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred comparatively higher preclinical expenses that it did in the comparable period in 2024, due to costs incurred for the IND-enabling studies required for the IND application for HCW9302 including setup costs and toxicology studies. Manufacturing costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect costs incurred replenishing supply of the high-expressing cell line of HCW9101.\n  * **General and administrative (G &A) expenses: **G&A expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, an increase of $129,216, or 9%. G&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $5.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively, a decrease of $307,237, or 6%. Changes in G&A expenses reflect cost cutting measures, offset by increases in professional fees, facilities and office expenses, and financing expenses. \n  * **Legal Expenses:** Legal expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $2.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 54%. Legal expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were $4.6 million and $15.8 million, respectively, an increase of $11.2 million, or 242%. The increase in legal expenses related to preparation of testimony and evidence for the hearing and the hearing itself in connection to the arbitration with ImmunityBio and its affiliates. There has since been a Settlement Agreement and parties have agreed to a stipulation to have the arbitration dismissed along with mutual general releases. See “Financial Guidance” below.\n  * **Net loss:** Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 was $4.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 21%. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 was $14.3 million and $26.7 million, respectively, an increase of $12.3 million, or 86%. \n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nImmunityBio and its affiliates initiated legal proceedings against the Company and Dr. Hing C. Wong, the Company’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, on December 31, 2022. Ultimately, legal proceedings against Company and Dr. Wong were consolidated in the arbitration before JAMS (“Arbitration”). As reported in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on July 18, 2024, the parties entered into a confidential Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement includes mutual general releases by and among the parties thereto. No party is required to make any monetary payments to any other party or person under the Settlement Agreement and each party agreed to bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the matter. Remediation activities are substantially complete, and the parties agreed to the stipulation and dismissal of the Arbitration. With the execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company resolved the attendant uncertainties for the outcome of the arbitration and additional complexities. However, the Company incurred substantial legal fees in its defense and for the defense of Dr. Wong. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported $14.4 million in obligations for legal fees within accounts payable on its condensed balance sheet. The Company is engaged in discussions with the law firms involved with this matter to arrange a reasonable payment plan with respect to those legal fees. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that substantial doubt exists regarding its ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed interim financial statements, without additional funding or financial support. The Company launched a multi-faceted financing plan in the third quarter of 2024 to raise the capital required through equity financings and business development transactions to fund the future product development and operations of the Company. \n\nA major objective of the financing strategy is to regain compliance with Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). We were notified by Nasdaq staff that we are not in compliance with continued listing requirements on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Company was granted a period of 180 calendar days by Nasdaq in which to comply. The first deadline is currently scheduled for December 16, 2024. The Company intends to take all reasonable measures available to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Global Market, and will utilize our right to appeal to Nasdaq to extend our deadline to regain compliance based on a solid financial plan to do so.\n\n**About HCW Biologics:**\n\nHCW Biologics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between chronic, low-grade inflammation, and age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases, as well as other inflammatory conditions such as long-haul COVID-19.

(the “Company” or “HCW Biologics”) (NASDAQ: HCWB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between inflammation and age-related diseases, today reported financial results and recent business highlights for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nDr. Hing C. Wong, Founder and CEO of HCW Biologics, stated, “We reached a critical milestone recently that has profound implications for the future of our Company -- we successfully reached a settlement agreement for an arbitration that created an overhang that hampered our progress for nearly two years. We wasted no time in launching our multi-faceted financing plan, including a significant equity offering and a reinvigorated out-licensing program. We have a bright future ahead, as we have emerged with the TOBI™ platform and a strong portfolio of TOBI™-based molecules, as well as several development-stage ideas that we consider “next generation” immunotherapeutics which leverage what we learned from the human data readouts from the initial phases of our clinical trials. We remain committed to developing immunotherapeutic drugs that target the reduction of senescent cells and the proinflammatory factors they secrete. Our focus continues to be on senescence-associated disorders, most typical in age-related diseases, including cancer. We are also excited to bring HCW9302 to the clinic in the very near future to evaluate this drug in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by expanding regulatory T cells.”\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * On July 13, 2024, the Company entered into a confidential Settlement Agreement and Release (“Settlement Agreement”) to resolve arbitration brought against the Company and Dr. Hing C. Wong, the Company’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer. The Settlement Agreement includes mutual general releases by and among all the parties. There were no monetary payments or damages paid by any party under the Settlement Agreement. See “Financial Guidance.”\n  * Going forward, the Company retains ownership and control of the TOBI™ platform and TOBI™-based molecules, with no restrictions under the Settlement Agreement on its ability to use the TOBI™ platform for protein-fusion molecules for non-oncology indications. The Company may pursue the clinical development of treatments for cancer indications based on HCW9302, HCW9206 and HCW9201. Further, HCW Biologics retains ownership of the Wugen license and shares of Wugen common stock transferred to the Company as the upfront licensing fee from Wugen for granting the Wugen license.\n  * A new financing plan was launched including an equity offering, which the Company intends to close before the end of 2024. Financing plans also include out-licensing non-core assets, and there are several discussions underway with potential licensing partners. \n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenues:** Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $622,807 and $618,854, respectively. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $664,690 and $1.7 million, respectively. Revenues in both periods were derived exclusively from the sale of licensed molecules to the Company’s licensee, Wugen. The licensed molecules are one of the inputs for manufacturing Wugen’s products.\n  * **Research and development (R &D) expenses:** R&D expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, an increase of $412,520, or 26%. R&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $3.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively, an increase of $279,991, or 7%. Manufacturing costs increased in three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 because the Company was replenishing its supply of a high-expressing cell line of HCW9101. Preclinical expenses declined in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 due to a change in the types of activities being performed in connection with IND-enabling activities to prepare an IND application to obtain permission from the FDA to evaluate HCW9302 in an autoimmune indication. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023, preclinical costs were incurred for setup costs for toxicology studies and other IND-enabling studies. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, costs were incurred for supplemental research studies. Clinical trial expenses were incurred in the three- and six-month period ended June 30, 2023 related to two clinical studies to evaluate HCW9218 in chemo-refractory / chemo-resistant solid tumors. Clinical trial expenses declined in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 because these trials were fully enrolled in the first quarter of 2024.\n  * **General and administrative (G &A) expenses: **G&A expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, an increase of $6,332, or 0%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in fees for auditing and tax advisory services, offset by a reduction in salaries and benefits arising from the Company’s cost-cutting measures. G&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $3.6 million and $3.2 million, a decrease of $436,454, or 12%. The decrease was a result of cost-cutting measures and a decrease in legal fees incurred in procuring patents and insurance-related costs, partially offset by an increase in financing costs.\n  * **Legal Expenses:** Legal expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $1.4 million and $10.4 million, respectively, an increase of $9.0 million, or 629%. Legal expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 were $2.5 million and $14.8 million, an increase of $12.3 million, or 484%. The increase in legal expenses is related to the Altor/NantCell matter. See further discussion of the Altor/NantCell arbitration in “Financial Guidance.”\n  * **Net loss:** Net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 was $4.3 million and $15.3 million, respectively, an increase of $11.0 million, or 255%. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 was $9.4 million and $22.7 million, respectively, an increase of $13.4 million, or 143%.\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company has raised $8.0 million to date in 2024, through a $2.5 million private placement of common stock to officers and directors and $5.5 million issuance of Secured Notes secured by the Company’s Wugen shares. The Company is authorized to raise up to $10.0 million in Secured Notes and intends to have the Secured Notes offering fully subscribed.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company believes that substantial doubt exists regarding its ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed interim financial statements, without additional funding or financial support. After considering the elements of the Company’s financing plan that were probable to occur within a year of the date of issuance, the Company concluded that substantial doubt was not alleviated in its going concern analysis.\n\nAs reported in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on July 18, 2024, as of July 13, 2024, the Company and Dr. Hing C. Wong, the Company’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, entered into the Settlement Agreement, with Altor BioScience, LLC (“Altor”), NantCell, Inc. (“NantCell”), and ImmunityBio, Inc. (the parent of Altor and NantCell, together with Altor and NantCell, “ImmunityBio”), to resolve the previously disclosed arbitration before JAMS brought by Altor and NantCell (the “Arbitration”) as well as a complaint Altor filed against the Company in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware for the contribution of legal fees and expenses advanced to Dr. Wong (“Complaint”). The parties entered into the Settlement Agreement to avoid the costs, disruption and distraction of further litigation. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no party will make monetary payments to any other party or person and each party will bear its own expenses. The Company is completing procedures required to be in compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement provides that, upon completion of these procedures, the parties will stipulate that the Arbitration and Complaint should be dismissed. The Company retains rights to develop immunotherapeutic treatments based on TOBI™-based molecules as well as the TOBI™ platform, in addition to the Wugen license and Wugen equity interest. The Company reported a balance of $10.0 million for legal fees incurred but not yet paid that were included within Accounts payable and an accrual of $4.8 million for accrued legal fees within Accrued liabilities and other current liabilities in the accompany condensed balance sheet as of June 30, 2024. In order not to overwhelm the Company’s resources, a reasonable payment plan will be required. The Company is engaged in discussions with the law firms involved with this matter.\n\nAs reported on the Company’s Form 8-K filed on August 12, 2024, the Company received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Staff (“Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. The notifications from Nasdaq do not impact the listing of the Company’s common stock at this time. The Company received a notice that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules for the $50.0 million market value listed securities requirement as of June 17, 2024; the minimum bid price as of August 6, 2024; and the $15.0 million market value of publicly held shares requirement as of August 8, 2024. The Company has 180 days from the respective date of notice to address each deficiency. While the Company is exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of its common stock on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or maintain compliance with the applicable continued listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n\n**About HCW Biologics:**\n\nHCW Biologics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between chronic, low-grade inflammation, and age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as other conditions such as long-haul COVID-19.
