We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the\nUnited States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea,\nAustralia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco operated 861, 838,\nand 815 warehouses worldwide at September 3, 2023, August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. The\nCompany operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan,\nand Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol\n“COST.”\nWereportona52/53-weekfiscalyear,consistingofthirteenfour-weekperiodsandendingontheSunday\nnearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter\nconsists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal\nimpact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season.\nReferences to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. References to 2022 and\n2021relatetothe52-weekfiscalyearsendedAugust28,2022,andAugust29,2021.\nGeneral\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our\nmembers low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide\nrange of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with\nthe operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of\nmerchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to\noperate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other\nretailers.Weoftensellinventorybeforewearerequiredtopayforit,evenwhiletakingadvantageofearly\npaymentdiscounts.\n4\nWebuymostofourmerchandisedirectlyfromsuppliersandrouteittocross-dockingconsolidationpoints\n(depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from suppliers and quickly\nship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering\ncosts associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Our e-commerce operations ship\nmerchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery\narrangementswithoursuppliers.\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 147,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly\nlarger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of\nmerchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of\nmerchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and\nexitsandusingamembershipformat,webelieveourinventorylosses(shrinkage)arewellbelowthoseof\ntypicalretailoperations.\nOur warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have\nextended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other\nefficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales.\nMerchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large\nquantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain\ncredit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2%\nrewardcertificates,co-brandcardholderrebates,andourproprietarystored-valuecard(shopcard).\nOur strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we\nbelieve are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes,\nand colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core\nwarehousebusiness,significantlylessthanotherbroadlineretailers.Weaverageanywherefrom9,000to\n11,000SKUsonline,someofwhicharealsoavailableinourwarehouses.Manyconsumableproductsare\nofferedforsaleincase,carton,ormultiple-packquantitiesonly.\nInkeepingwithourpolicyofmembersatisfaction,wegenerallyacceptreturnsofmerchandise.Oncertain\nelectronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support\nservices, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain\nelectronicitems.\nWeoffermerchandiseandservicesinthefollowingcategories:\nCoreMerchandiseCategories(orcorebusiness):\n• Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and\ntobacco)\n• Non-Foods (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden\nand patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage,\ntickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and\njewelry)\n• FreshFoods(includingmeat,produce,servicedeli,andbakery)\nWarehouseAncillary(includesgasoline,pharmacy,optical,foodcourt,hearingaids,andtireinstallation)\nandOtherBusinesses(includese-commerce1,businesscenters1,travel,andother)\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging\nmembers to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by\ncountry,andwehavenogasolinebusinessinKorea,China,orSweden.Weoperated692gasstationsat\ntheendof2023.Ourgasolinebusinessrepresentedapproximately13%oftotalnetsalesin2023.\n1 E-commerceandbusinesscentersareallocatedtotheappropriatemerchandisecategoriesintheNetSalesportionofItem7.\n5\nOur other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and\nwarehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader\nselection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 6% of total net\nsales in 2023. This figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as\nbusiness delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items\ntailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and\ndeliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation\npackages, car rentals, cruises, hotels, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered\nintheU.S.,Canada,andtheU.K.).\nWe have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain\na significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. When sources of supply become unavailable,\nwe seek alternatives. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality\nandmemberdemandarehighandthevaluetoourmembersissignificant.\nCertain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the\nconsolidatedfinancialstatementsincludedinItem8ofthisReport.\nMembership\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites.

Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in the U.S. and varies in other\ncountries.Allpaidmembershipsincludeafreehouseholdcard.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide at the end of 2023.\nThe majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date.

Executive memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K.,\nJapan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members earn a 2%\nreward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at\nCostco warehouses. This program offers services that vary by state and country and provide access to\nadditional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home\ninsurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. Executive members totaled 32.3\nmillion and represented 45.4% of paid members. The sales penetration of Executive members\nrepresentedapproximately72.8%ofworldwidenetsalesin2023.\n6\nHumanCapital\nOur Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the\nobligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We must also carefully control our selling, general and\nadministrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices.\nCompensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is\ncarefullymonitored.\nEmployeeBase\nAttheendof2023,weemployed316,000employeesworldwide.Approximately95%areemployedinour\nmembership warehouses and distribution channels, and approximately 5% are represented by unions.\nWealsoutilizeseasonalemployees.\nThetotalnumberofemployeesbysegmentwas:\n2023 2022 2021\nUnitedStates............................... 208,000 202,000 192,000\nCanada.................................... 51,000 50,000 47,000\nOtherInternational .......................... 57,000 52,000 49,000\nTotalemployees ............................ 316,000 304,000 288,000\nGrowthandEngagement\nWe believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing largely to the\ncommitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but\ncareers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective. The more significant include:\ncompetitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and\ndistributions channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and a target ratio of at least 50% of our\nemployee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for\nthe industry, a high retention rate. In 2023, in the U.S. that rate was approximately 90% for employees\nwhohavebeenwithusforatleastoneyear.\nDiversity,EquityandInclusion\nThe commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to promoting\ndiversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. We strive for an\nenvironment where all employees feel that they belong, are accepted, included, respected and supported\nbecause of who they are. We demonstrate leadership commitment to equity through consistent\ncommunication, employee development and education, support of diversity and inclusion initiatives within\nthe organization, community involvement, and supplier diversity. Costco continues its efforts to develop\nfuture leaders, including through the supervisor in training programs. In 2023, over 7,800 hourly\nemployeescompletedthe6-weekcourse.\nWellBeing\nCostco strives to provide our employees with competitive wages and excellent benefits. In March 2023,\nwe increased the top of the wage scales by 85 cents per hour in the U.S, Canada and Puerto Rico. In\nSeptember of 2023, we increased the starting wage to at least $18.50 for all entry-level positions in the\nU.S. We have also expanded our benefits in the U.S. to include additional mental health support for\nchildrenandadultsatlittletonocosttoouremployees.Costcoisfirmlycommittedtoprotectingthehealth\nandsafetyofourmembersandemployeesandtoservingourcommunities.\n7\nFor more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives, see “Employees” within our\nSustainability Commitment (located on our website). The Sustainability Commitment and other\ninformation on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of thisAnnual\nReport.\nCompetition\nOur industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection,\nlocation,convenience,distributionstrategy,andcustomerservice.Wecompeteonaworldwidebasiswith\nglobal, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, online\nretailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a\nsingle category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our\nsignificant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse\nclubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club in the U.S. Many of the major\nmetropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing\nclubs.\nIntellectualProperty\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes,\ntrade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our\nbusiness and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and\nprotection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-\nlabel brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at\nprices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise\nofferings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of\nourprivate-labelitems.\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other\nagreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating\nin the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently\nconsider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and\nourconsolidatedfinancialstatementsandrelatednotesinItem8ofthisReport.\n9\nBusinessandOperatingRisks\nWearehighlydependentonthefinancialperformanceofourU.S.andCanadianoperations.\nOur financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations,\nwhichcomprised87%and84%ofnetsalesandoperatingincomein2023.WithintheU.S.,wearehighly\ndependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2023. Our California\nmarket, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other\ndomestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially\nadversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S.\noperations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things:\nslow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating\nexpenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse\nopenings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross\nmargin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels\nof unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and\ninnovativenewproducts.\nWe may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in\nexisting markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse\nimpactonourbusiness,financialconditionandresultsofoperations.\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses\nand depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and\notherregulationsrestrictingtheconstructionandoperationofourwarehousesanddepots,aswellaslocal\ncommunityactionsopposedtothelocationofourwarehousesordepotsatspecificsitesandtheadoption\nof local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find\nsuitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses\nanddepots.Wealsomayhavedifficultynegotiatingleasesorpurchaseagreementsonacceptableterms.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or\nrestrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us.\nFailure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease\nand operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future\ngrowthandprofitability.\nWe seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may\ndraw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales\nperformance,membertraffic,andprofitability.\nWe intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in\nattracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club\noperators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market.\nEntry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors\nwithalarge,establishedmarketpresence.Wecannotensurethatnewwarehousesandnewe-commerce\nwebsites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely\naffected.\nWe have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy\nand efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels.The effectiveness of these investments can be\nless predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired\nratesofreturn.\n10\nOur failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect\nourresultsofoperations.\nMembership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in\nourmembershipbase,increasethepenetrationofExecutivemembership,andsustainhighrenewalrates\nmaterially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact\ncomparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and\nmembershipfeerevenue,negativelyimpactingourresultsofoperations.\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality,\ncompetitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member\nloyalty.These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a\ngrowing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member\nacceptanceorconfidence,oursalesandgrossmarginresultscouldbeadverselyaffected.\nDisruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other\nfacilitiescouldadverselyaffectsalesandmembersatisfaction.\nWe depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily\nthrough our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to\nsupport our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe\nthat our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics\nor other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may\nresult in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely\naffect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend heavily on third-\nparty and in-house logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to\nprovideservicesinatimelyfashion.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively\naffect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our\nmarketshare.\nIt is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will\ndesire.Oursuccessdepends,inpart,onourabilitytoidentifyandrespondtotrendsindemographicsand\nconsumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,\npreferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending\npatterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and\nservices, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our\npurchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we\nmay experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of\nwhich would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross\nmarginandoperatingincome.\nAvailability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business.\nFailure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would\nadverselyimpactouroperations.\nIT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very\nhigh volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce\nreports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an\nadverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our\nmanufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to\nour members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these\nprojects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business\noperations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital\nresiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications\n11\nfailures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events\nsuch as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems,\ndata centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT\nservices and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business\nservices, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are\ncurrently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or\ndelay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation\nefforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact\nour financial condition and results of operations. Insufficient ITcapacity could also impact our capacity for\ntimely,completeandaccuratefinancialandnon-financialreportingrequiredbylaw.\nWe are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst\nmultiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations\nglobally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members,\nsuppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to\nlitigationandregulatoryaction.\nIncreased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems,\nnetworks,productsandservices.WerelyuponITsystemsandnetworks,someofwhicharemanagedby\nor belong to third parties, including suppliers, partners, vendors, and service providers. Additionally, we\ncollect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, employees, and other\nthird parties. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a\nsecure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote work has also\nincreased the possible attack surfaces. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and\ndata, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and\nin some cases, these attempts are successful. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to\ncoordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent\nthreats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware\nattacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our\nsecurity efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of\nour systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. Our IT systems\nand networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host\nor have access to confidential information, periodically have vulnerabilities, which may go unnoticed for a\nperiod of time. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always\ncomplete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of\nsecurity events. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be\nno guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented\nandareimplementing,willbesufficienttoprotectoursystems,informationorotherproperty.\nThe potential impacts of a cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government\nenforcementactions,penalties,disruptiontosystemsandoperations,unauthorizedreleaseofconfidential\nor otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT\nsystems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model,\nloss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification\narrangements with third parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to\ncybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and\ninternational laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation,\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and other privacy\nand cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant\npotentialpenaltiesfornoncompliance.\n12\nWearesubjecttopayment-relatedrisks.\nWeacceptpaymentsusingavarietyofmethods,includingselectcreditanddebitcards,cashandchecks,\nco-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer\nnew payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance\nrequirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other\nrelated acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to\nprovide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could\ndisrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.

For example, we\nare subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and\nstandards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and\ntransmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may\nbe liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to\naccept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely\naffected.

Such retailers\nand warehouse club operators compete vigorously and in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection\nand availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of\nwebsites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved\nthe ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have\ngreaterfinancialresourcesandtechnologycapabilities,betteraccesstomerchandise,andgreatermarket\npenetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail\nmarkets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial\nresults.\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business,\nfinancialcondition,andresultsofoperations.\nHigher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt\nlevels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real\nestate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal,\nmonetaryandtaxpoliciesincludingchangesininterestrates,taxrates,duties,tariffs,orotherrestrictions,\nsovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely\naffect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or\nabilitytopurchaseinventory.Additionally,trade-relatedactionsinvariouscountries,particularlyChinaand\nthe United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise.

MD&A\nis provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial\nstatements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This\nsection generally discusses the results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022. For discussion related\nto the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2022 compared to 2021 refer to Part II,\nItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our\nfiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC)onOctober5,2022.\nOverview\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly\ncomparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods,\nand fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire\ninstallation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). Comparable sales is\ndefined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and\nexpansions,andsalesrelatedtoe-commercewebsitesoperatingformorethanoneyear.Themeasureis\nintended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Comparable sales growth is achieved\nthrough increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on\neach visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that\nare beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international\noperations); inflation or deflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive\nconditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our\nSG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating\ncomparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right\nmerchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-\nterm. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do\nbusiness, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and\ngross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide\nrange of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce\noperations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in\ncompetition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these\nchanges, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the\npenetrationofourprivate-labelitems,andthroughonlineofferings.\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do\nnotfocusintheshort-termonmaximizingpricescharged,butinsteadseektomaintainwhatwebelieveis\na perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive\nvalues. Merchandise costs in 2023 continued to be impacted by inflation, however at a lower rate than\nwhat we experienced in 2022. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our\nmerchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.Those strategies can include, but are\nnot limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual\npurchasing and in greater volumes, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our\ninvestments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet\ncompetition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our\nmembers, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross\nmarginpercentage).\n21\nWe believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross\nmargin percentage and lower SG&A expense, relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher\npenetrationofgasolinesaleswillgenerallylowerourgrossmarginpercentage.Rapidlychanginggasoline\nprices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit\nnet sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but\ndecreases our SG&Aexpenses as a percentage of net sales.Adecline in gasoline prices has the inverse\neffect.\nGovernment actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have\naffected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among\nother things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely\nimpactourresults.\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.As our warehouse base grows, available\nanddesirablesitesbecomemoredifficulttosecure,andsquarefootagegrowthbecomesacomparatively\nless substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower\ninitial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing\nwarehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they\nrelatetotheresultsofourtotaloperations.Ourrateofsquarefootagegrowthisgenerallyhigherinforeign\nmarkets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce\nbusiness, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our\nwarehouseoperations.\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.\nThis format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to\nwhich we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members,\nand sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate\nmay be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new\nmarkets.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved\nsuccessesinthisarea,somesignificantcostsarepartiallyoutsideourcontrol,particularlyhealthcareand\nutility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to\nminimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of\nreducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation\nlevels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for\nexample, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because\nour business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated\nstatements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&Aexpenses, can have substantial impacts\nonnetincome.\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating\nsegments(seeNote11totheconsolidatedfinancialstatementsincludedinItem8ofthisReport).Certain\noperationsintheOtherInternationalsegmenthaverelativelyhigherratesofsquarefootagegrowth,lower\nwageandbenefitcostsasapercentageofsales,lessornodirectmembershipwarehousecompetition,or\nlacke-commerceorbusinessdelivery.\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign\ncurrenciesrelativetotheU.S.dollar,whicharedifferencesbetweentheforeign-exchangeratesweuseto\nconvert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This\nimpact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and\nprior period's currency exchange rates.

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $15,234 and $11,049 at\nSeptember 3, 2023, andAugust 28, 2022. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables\nrepresented $2,282 and $2,010. These receivables generally settle within four days.

Our cash\nflow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in\noperations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs,\nincluding payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in\noperations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise\ninventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by\nseveral factors, including inventory levels and turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate\ndeliverytimes,paymenttermswithsuppliers,andearlypaymentstoobtaindiscounts.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $4,972 in 2023, compared to $3,915 in 2022, and is primarily\nrelated to capital expenditures. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and\nmaturitiesofshort-terminvestments.\nCapitalExpenditures\nOur primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled\nwarehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities,\ninitial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2023, we spent $4,323 on capital expenditures, and\nitisourcurrentintentiontospendapproximately$4,400to$4,600duringfiscal2024.Theseexpenditures\nare expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-\nterm investments. We opened 26 new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2023, and plan to open\nup to 28 additional new warehouses, including one relocation, in 2024. There can be no assurance that\ncurrent expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital\nexpenditureneedsandtheeconomicenvironment.\n27\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $2,614 in 2023, compared to $4,283 in 2022. Cash flows\nused in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock,\nand withholding taxes on stock-based awards. In 2022, cash flow used in financing activities included\npayments to our former joint-venture partner for a dividend and the purchase of their equity interest in\nTaiwan,totaling$1,050intheaggregate,andrepaymentsofour2.300%SeniorNotes.\nStockRepurchasePrograms\nOn January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount\nof $4,000, which expires in January 2027.

These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due\nto changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to\ntime, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule\n10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.\nThe remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,563 at the end of\n2023.\nDividends\nCash dividends declared in 2023 totaled $3.84 per share, as compared to $3.38 per share in 2022.

We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and\nevaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in\nNote1totheconsolidatedfinancialstatementsincludedinItem8ofthisReport.\n28\nInsurance/Self-insuranceLiabilities\nClaims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage,\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded\npredominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit\nexposures arising from very large losses. We use various risk management mechanisms, including a\nwholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities\nassociated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated using historical claims\nexperience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims\nare highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and\nunforeseen developments in claims. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and\ncosts could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not\nbeenmaterial.\nRecentAccountingPronouncements\nWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our\nfinancialstatements.\nItem7A—QuantitativeandQualitativeDisclosuresAboutMarketRisk(amountsinmillions)\nOur exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency\nexchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial\ninstrumentsfortradingpurposes.\nInterestRateRisk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that\nare diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in\ngovernment and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the\ndate of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and\nsecondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate\nsecurities.Thesesecuritiesaresubjecttochangesinfairvalueduetointerestratefluctuations.\nOur policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations,\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S.\ngovernmentandgovernmentagencymoneymarketfunds,andinsuredbankbalances.Ourwholly-owned\ncaptive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S.\ngovernment and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International\nsubsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank\ncertificatesofdeposit,generallydenominatedinlocalcurrencies.\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2023 would have had an immaterial\nincremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale,\nthe unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected\nwithin stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market\nconditions, and other factors.As of the end of 2023, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,484.\nFluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term\ndebt.\n29\nForeignCurrencyRisk\nOur foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to\nfluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-\nexchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future\nexpenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to\neconomically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our\ninternational subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to\nengage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-\nexchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional\ncurrency exchange rates at September 3, 2023, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by\n$109andresultedinanunrealizedlossintheconsolidatedstatementsofincomeforthesameamount.\nCommodityPriceRisk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other\ncommodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through\nfixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and\nCanada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in\naddition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the\ncharacteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal\nsales”exceptionunderauthoritativeguidanceandrequirenomark-to-marketadjustment.\n30\nItem8—FinancialStatementsandSupplementaryData\nCOSTCOWHOLESALECORPORATION\nINDEXTOCONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nPage\nReportsofIndependentRegisteredPublicAccountingFirm .................................. 32\nConsolidatedStatementsofIncome....................................................... 35\nConsolidatedStatementsofComprehensiveIncome ........................................ 36\nConsolidatedBalanceSheets ............................................................ 37\nConsolidatedStatementsofEquity........................................................ 38\nConsolidatedStatementsofCashFlows ................................................... 39\nNotestoConsolidatedFinancialStatements ............................................... 40\n31\nREPORTOFINDEPENDENTREGISTEREDPUBLICACCOUNTINGFIRM\nTotheStockholdersandBoardofDirectors\nCostcoWholesaleCorporation:\nOpinionontheConsolidatedFinancialStatements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and\nsubsidiaries (the Company) as of September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 53-week period ended\nSeptember 3, 2023, and the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, and the\nrelated notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

At September 3, 2023, Costco operated 861\nwarehouses worldwide: 591 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and\nPuerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 33 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Korea, 15\nin Australia, 14 in Taiwan, five in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New\nZealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K.,\nMexico,Korea,Taiwan,Japan,andAustralia.\nBasisofPresentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its subsidiaries. The Company\nreports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the\nCompany’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to\nnetincomerelatetonetincomeattributabletoCostco.\nFiscalYearEnd\nThe Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to\nAugust31.Referencesto2023relatetothe53-weekfiscalyearendedSeptember3,2023.Referencesto\n2022and2021relatetothe52-weekfiscalyearsendedAugust28,2022,andAugust29,2021.\nUseofEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account\nhistorical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable.

Credit and debit card receivables were $2,282 and\n$2,010attheendof2023and2022.\nShort-TermInvestments\nShort-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with\nmaturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five\n40\nyears may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly\nliquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\nShort-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific\nidentification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome(loss)untilrealized.Realizedgainsandlossesfromthesaleofavailable-for-salesecurities,ifany,\nare determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the\nconsolidated statements of income.

Changes in their fair value are\nprimarilyattributabletochangesininterestratesandmarketliquidity.Short-terminvestmentsclassifiedas\nheld-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity\nand are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring\nbasis.\nThe Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment,\nusing both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the\nresult of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the\nconsolidatedstatementsofincome.\nFairValueofFinancialInstruments\nTheCompanyaccountsforcertainassetsandliabilitiesatfairvalue.ThecarryingvalueoftheCompany’s\nfinancial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable,\napproximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for\nthe carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate\ndebt.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by\napplying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring\nfairvalue.Thethreelevelsofinputsare:\nLevel1:Quotedmarketpricesinactivemarketsforidenticalassetsorliabilities.\nLevel2:Observablemarket-basedinputsorunobservableinputsthatarecorroboratedbymarket\ndata.\nLevel3:Significantunobservableinputsthatarenotcorroboratedbymarketdata.\nThe Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are\nbased on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in\nan active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative\nfinancial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses\ndata from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or\nspread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks,\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are\nobservable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\nThe Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the\nindividualsecuritiesasofthebeginningofthereportingperiodinwhichthetransfer(s)occurred.\nCurrent financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial\nliabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance\npriceandadjustedforunamortizeddiscountsorpremiumsanddebtissuancecosts.Discounts,premiums\nand debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair\nvalue of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed\nmarkettransactions,andestimatesbaseduponinterestrates,maturities,andcredit.\n41\nReceivables,Net\nReceivablesconsistprimarilyofvendor,reinsurance,creditcardincentive,third-partypharmacyandother\nreceivables.Vendorreceivablesincludediscountsandvolumerebates.Balancesaregenerallypresented\nonagrossbasis,separatefromanyrelatedpayabledue.Incertaincircumstances,thesereceivablesmay\nbe settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a\nnet basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance\nsubsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the\namounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under\nco-branded credit card arrangements. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due\nfrom members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities,\nmostlytax-relateditems.\nThe valuation allowance related to receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements\nattheendof2023and2022.\nMerchandiseInventories\nMerchandiseinventoriesconsistofthefollowing:\n2023 2022\nUnitedStates ............................................ $ 12,153 $ 13,160\nCanada ................................................. 1,579 1,966\nOtherInternational ........................................ 2,919 2,781\nMerchandiseinventories ............................... $ 16,651 $ 17,907\nMerchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are\nvalued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes\nthe LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs\nwith current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected\nannual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at\nyear-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. An\nimmaterial LIFO charge was recorded in 2023. Due to inflation in 2022, a $438 charge was recorded to\nmerchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28,\n2022.CanadianandOtherInternationalmerchandiseinventoriesarepredominantlyvaluedusingthecost\nandretailinventorymethods,respectively,usingthefirst-in,first-out(FIFO)basis.\nTheCompanyprovidesforestimatedinventorylossesbetweenphysicalinventorycountsusingestimates\nbased on experience.

Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by\nestimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates,\nprovidedthattheyareprobableandreasonablyestimable.\nPropertyandEquipment,Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily\nusing the straight-line method over estimated useful lives.

For asset groups held and used,\nincluding warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable\nwhen the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of\nthe asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not\nconsidered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal\nto the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups\nclassified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair\nvaluelesscoststosell.TheCompanyestimatesfairvaluebyobtainingmarketappraisalsfromthirdparty\nbrokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2023 were immaterial. In\n2022 and 2021, the Company recognized write-offs of $118 and $84 for information technology assets\nwhicharereflectedinSG&A.\nLeases\nThe Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and\ndistribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company\ncan exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-\nfair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair\nmarketvalueorpurchasepricestatedintheagreement;or(c)arightoffirstrefusalintheeventofathird-\npartyoffer.\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably\ncertain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for\nperiodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales\nvolume, which are recognized as variable lease payments. Our leases do not contain any material\nresidualvalueguaranteesormaterialrestrictivecovenants.\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components\nand the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component\nforallassetclasses.TheCompanyinitiallyrecordsright-of-use(ROU)assetsandleaseobligationsforits\nfinance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term.\nThe lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is\n43\nreasonablycertainthattheCompanywillexercisetheoption.AstherateimplicitintheCompany'sleases\nis not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the\nCompany's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the\nrate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a\ncollateralizedbasisoverasimilarterm.TheCompanyusesquotedinterestratesfromfinancialinstitutions\nto derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as\ndescribedinPropertyandEquipment,Netabove.During2023,theCompanyrecognizedchargestotaling\n$391, primarily related to the impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping\nactivities.Thischargeisincludedinmerchandisecosts.\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must\nbe removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with\nan offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term, based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to\nremove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the\nobligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold\nimprovement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities\nassociated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheet.\nGoodwillandAcquiredIntangibleAssets\nGoodwillrepresentstheexcessofacquisitioncostoverthefairvalueofthenetassetsacquiredandisnot\nsubject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or\nwhen circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at\nthe reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market\napproach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected\ndiscounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and\ntransactionstodevelopmetricstobeappliedtohistoricalandexpectedfutureoperatingresults.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit\nexposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses various risk management mechanisms,\nincluding a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance\nprogram.LiabilitiesassociatedwiththerisksthatareretainedbytheCompanyarenotdiscountedandare\nestimated using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial\n44\nassumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future\noccurrences, claims, or expenses differ from these assumptions and historical trends.At the end of 2023\nand 2022, these insurance liabilities were $1,513 and $1,364 in the aggregate, and were included in\naccrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified\nbasedontheirnature.\nThe captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in SG&A\nexpenses in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program\nthat includes third-party participants. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance\nprogram are designed to limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments\nrelated to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are\nrecognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program,\ntheCompanyretainsitsprimaryobligationtothepolicyholdersforprioractivity.\nDerivatives\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of\nbusiness. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts,\nseeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future\nexpenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S.\ndollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with\nfunctional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative\nhedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not\nintend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related\ncontingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The\naggregatefairvalueamountsofderivativeinstrumentsinanetliabilitypositionandtheamountneededto\nsettle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were\nimmaterial at the end of 2023 and 2022. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward\nforeign-exchange contracts were $1,068 and $1,242 at the end of 2023 and 2022. See Note 3 for\ninformationonthefairvalueofunsettledforwardforeign-exchangecontractsattheendof2023and2022.\nThe unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying\nconsolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward\nforeign-exchangecontractswereimmaterialin2023,2022and2021.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and\nother commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate\nthrough the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the\nU.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural\ngas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of\nderivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under\nauthoritativeguidanceandrequirenomark-to-marketadjustment.\nForeignCurrency\nThe functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets\nand liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet\ndate. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and\nexpenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates\nprevailingduringtheyear.\nThe Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest\nincome and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar\ncash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their\nfunctional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of\n45\nforward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $46 and $84 in 2023 and 2022 and immaterial in\n2021.\nRevenueRecognition\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which\nincludes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to\ngovernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on\nhistorical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly.

A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into\nconsideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in\nFebruary and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card\narrangementsinCanadaandcertainotherInternationalsubsidiaries.\n46\nMerchandiseCosts\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and\noutbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing\noperations, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits,\ndepreciation,andutilitiesinfreshfoodsdepartmentsandcertainancillarybusinesses.\nVendorConsideration\nThe Company receives funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These\nprograms are evidenced by agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when\nearned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of\nmerchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a\nreduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related\nagreement,orbyanothersystematicapproach.\nSelling,GeneralandAdministrativeExpenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’\ncompensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary\nbusinesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees,\nincluding buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all\nbuildingandequipmentdepreciation,stockcompensationexpense,creditanddebitcardprocessingfees,\nutilities, preopening, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce\nwebsiteoperations.\nRetirementPlans\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have\ncompleted 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a\nportion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an\nannual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in\nCanada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages.

Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under\nacceleratedvestingprovisionsontheannualvestingdate.Forfeituresarerecognizedastheyoccur.\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the\nrequisite service period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based\nawards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25\nor more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to\nvote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. Compensation expense for the\naccelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of\ncompensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value\nof the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the\n47\ncommonstockonthemeasurementdatelessthepresentvalueoftheexpecteddividends forgoneduring\nthevestingperiod.\nStock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of\nmerchandise.SeeNote7foradditionalinformationontheCompany’sstock-basedcompensationplans.\nIncomeTaxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, credits and loss carry-\nforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be\nrecoveredorsettled.Theeffectondeferredtaxassetsandliabilitiesofachangeintaxratesisrecognized\nin income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The functions of the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee are to identify and approve individuals qualified to serve as members of the Board, select director\nnominees for the annual meeting of shareholders, evaluate the Board’s performance, develop and\nrecommend to the Board corporate governance guidelines, and provide oversight with respect to corporate\ngovernance, ethical conduct and environmental and sustainability policies and initiatives. The committee is\nauthorized by its charter to engage its own advisors. The Board is responsible for nominating members for\nelection to the Board and for filling vacancies on the Board that may occur between annual meetings of\nshareholders. The committee is responsible for identifying, screening and recommending to the Board\ncandidates for Board membership. The committee approved the nomination of the candidates reflected in\nproposal 1. The committee has been engaged in a review of potential candidates as part of an ongoing\nrefreshment process. Ms. Foulkes, who was initially elected by the Board on August 16, 2023, came to the\ncommittee's attention through Chair Hamilton James, and is well known by another current director, Maggie\nWilderotter. When formulating its recommendations, the committee will also consider advice and\nrecommendations from others as it deems appropriate. The members of the committee, which met five times\ninfiscal2023,areMessrs.Raikes(chair)andDenmanandMrs.Wilderotter.\n8\nThe committee will consider shareholder recommendations for candidates to serve on the Board. In\naccordance with section 2.1 of our bylaws, which may be viewed at https://investor.costco.com, the name of\nany recommended candidate, together with pertinent biographical information, a document indicating the\ncandidate’s willingness to serve if elected, and evidence of the nominating shareholder’s ownership of\nCompany stock should be sent to the Secretary of the Company. The Company may require additional\ninformation, as described in our bylaws. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that nominees for\ndirector will be selected on the basis of, among other things, knowledge, experience, skills, expertise,\nintegrity, diversity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, and understanding of the Company’s\nbusiness environment, all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at the time.\nNominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to Board responsibilities.The Nominating\nand Governance Committee does not set specific, minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order\nfor the committee to recommend them to the Board, but rather believes that each nominee should be\nevaluatedbasedonindividualmerit,takingintoaccounttheneedsoftheCompanyandthecompositionofthe\nBoard.\nWe believe that the Company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints,\nbackgrounds, and experiences. Currently, of the eleven directors on the Board, four are women and one is\nAfrican American. In addition, as discussed above, our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and\nexperiencesasestablishedleadersinimportantareasofbusiness,governmentandnon-profitservicethatwe\nbelieve strengthens the Board’s ability to guide our Company. The Nominating and Governance Committee\noversees a self-assessment of the Board’s or its committees performance every year.The assessment seeks\nto identify specific areas, if any, in need of improvement or strengthening, including with respect to the\ndiversityofourBoardintermsofviewpoints,backgroundsandexperiences.Since2014,theBoard,ledbythe\nNominating and Governance Committee, has been engaged in a process to refresh its membership; eight\nmembershaveretiredorpassedawayandfivenewindependentdirectorshavebeenadded.\nOur bylaws provide for proxy access shareholder nominations for director candidates by eligible\nshareholders. Shareholder nominations require compliance with section 2.1 of the bylaws.Ashareholder who\nwishestoformallynominateacandidate,whetherforinclusionintheCompany'sproxystatementornot,must\nfollow the procedures described in our bylaws (which includes information required under SEC Rule 14a-19).\nThereisotherwisenoformalprocessprescribedforidentifyingandevaluatingnominees,exceptasdescribed\nintheCorporateGovernanceGuidelines,whichmaybeviewedathttps://investor.costco.com.\nBoard Structure. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board does not require the\nseparation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer and shall be free to\nchoose its Chairman in any way that it deems best for the Company at any given point in time. Currently the\npositions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are filled separately. Our Chief Executive Officer has\nprimary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, while our non-\nexecutive Chairman facilitates our Board’s independent oversight of management, promotes communication\nbetween management and the Board, and leads the Board’s consideration of key governance matters. The\nBoardbelievesthatthisleadershipstructureisappropriatefortheCompanyatthistime.\nTheRoleoftheBoardinRiskOversight.TheBoardseekstoensurethatmanagementhasprocesses\nfordealingappropriatelywithrisk.ItistheresponsibilityoftheCompany’sseniormanagementtodevelopand\nimplement the Company’s short- and long-term objectives and to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate the\nrisks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives. Management is responsible for identifying risk and risk\ncontrols related to significant business activities and Company objectives, and developing programs to\ndeterminethesufficiencyofriskidentification,thebalanceofpotentialrisktopotentialreward,theappropriate\nmanner in which to control risk, and the support of the risk-controlling behavior and the risk to Company\nstrategy.\nThe Board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through theAudit Committee, which\nreceives management reports on the potentially significant risks, including (without limitation) cybersecurity\nmatters, that the Company faces and how the Company is seeking to control risk where appropriate. The\ncommittee also oversees internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reports to the full\nboard on its risk-management tasks, including the enterprise risk management review. In more limited cases,\n9\nsuch as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets, risk oversight\nis addressedas partofthefullBoard’sengagementwiththeChiefExecutiveOfficerandmanagement.Board\nmembers also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business, financial, and other\nactivities of the Company.The Board also has overall responsibility for executive-officer succession planning.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with\ncorporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the Company’s ethics, environmental, social and\ngovernance(ESG),andcomplianceprograms.\nCOMPENSATIONOFDIRECTORS\nFor fiscal 2023, each non-employee director earned $37,000 per year for serving on the Board.\nDirectorsarereimbursedfortravelexpensesincurredinconnectionwiththeirduties.Infiscal2023,eachnon-\nemployee director received a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), with a value of $270,000.

These individuals are referred to as the “Named Executive\nOfficers\" and include: W. Craig Jelinek, Chief Executive Officer; Ron M. Vachris, President and Chief\nOperatingOfficer;RichardA.Galanti,ExecutiveVicePresident,ChiefFinancialOfficer;RussD.Miller,Senior\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer - Warehouse Operations, U.S. and Mexico; and Pierre Riel,\nExecutiveVicePresident,ChiefOperatingOfficer-InternationalDivision.\nCompensationPhilosophyandObjectives\nOur compensation programs are designed to motivate our executives and employees and enable\nthem to participate in the growth of our business. The Company believes it has been very successful in\nattracting and retaining quality employees, generally achieving low turnover in our executive, staff and\nwarehouse management ranks. In addition, in the judgment of the Compensation Committee, the programs\nhave contributed to the financial and competitive success of the Company. Accordingly, the Committee\nbelievesitisdesirabletocontinuetheseprograms.\nAt the 2023Annual Meeting, the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation was 95.42%\nin favor.The Committee did not determine to make any changes to the compensation programs as a result of\nthe vote. Compensation levels approved by the Committee for the Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2023\ndid not materially change from those approved for the prior year, except for Mr. Jelinek who received a\nsubstantialincreasetohisperformance-basedRSUaward,asdescribedbelowunder\"2023Compensationof\ntheChiefExecutiveOfficer.\"Discussionsbycertaindirectorsandmanagementwithanumberofshareholders\nsince the 2023Annual Meeting have not revealed significant concerns about the structure or operation of the\nCompany'scompensationprograms.\nRoleoftheCompensationCommittee\nThe Committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our Chief Executive\nOfficer.Forotherexecutiveofficers,itreviewstherecommendationsoftheChiefExecutiveOfficer,withwhich\nit generally agrees. The Committee’s function is more fully described under “Committees of the Board —\nCompensationCommittee.”\nDuringfiscal2023,theCommitteeconsistedofMr.Stanton(chair),andMmes.JewellandWilderotter.\nThe Committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but did not use any. The\nCommittee’s primary activity occurs in the fall, following the close of the fiscal year, when the Committee:\n(i) approves grants of RSUs, including performance targets for RSUs granted to executive officers for the\ncurrent fiscal year; (ii) determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for RSUs granted during\nthe prior fiscal year; (iii) approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just\nconcluded, including any salary increases and cash bonuses; and (iv) approves the executive officer cash-\nbonus program for the current fiscal year. The bonuses concerning environmental and social progress are\noverseenjointlywiththeNominatingandGovernanceCommittee.\nElementsofCompensation\nThe components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation (consisting\ngenerallyofperformance-basedRSUs),basesalary,cashbonuses,andotherbenefits(primarilyconsistingof\nhealth plans, a 401(k) plan and a deferred compensation plan). The Committee believes that these\ncomponents are appropriate and are consistent with the Company’s long-standing approach to executive\ncompensation, which has made equity awards the most significant form of compensation.The Committee did\nnot reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity, salary, bonus and other compensation\ncomponents for each executive officer. Rather, it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been\nutilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the\ncomponentsofthemixandthevalueofthetotalcompensationpackages.\n13\nPerformance-based RSUs. Performance-based RSU grants represent the largest component of\ncompensation, based on their fair value at the time of grant. The Committee believes that emphasizing this\nform of compensation helps align the interests of employee-grantees with those of shareholders, both in the\nshorter term (with one-year performance conditions) and in the longer term (with share ownership\nrequirements and time-based vesting of up to five years, subject to earlier vesting for long service, as\ndescribedbelow).\nBase salary. Base salary is the second largest compensation component. It is consistent with the\nneed for executive officers to have predictable cash compensation, which has been subject generally to\nmodestannualincreases.\nCash bonus. Cash bonuses are based on a variety of metrics. They address short-term incentives\nand are linked to performance during the fiscal year. Historically, at least some portion of the cash bonuses\nhas been paid each year. The Committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses in the current proportion is\nconsistent with preferring long-term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the Company and its\nshareholders. Over 7,000 employees are eligible for cash bonuses. To be eligible for the annual bonus, the\nindividualmustbeemployedbytheCompanyatthetimethebonusesarepaid(historicallyinNovember).\nOther elements. Consistent with its position as a low-overhead operator, the Company has modest\n“other compensation.” Significant components of this compensation include health care and helping\nexecutives fund their retirement needs (through the 401(k) and the deferred compensation plans); the\nCompanyprovidesnopensions.\nThese components of compensation mix incentives that are intended to reward shorter-term (twelve\nmonths) and longer-term performance (five years and beyond). Shorter-term incentives come primarily from\nthe initial award of RSUs being subject to achievement of a one-year performance metric and, to a\nsignificantly lesser extent, cash bonuses that are subject to one-year performance metrics. Longer-term\nincentives come primarily from the RSU award vesting of up to five years, and, to a lesser extent, share\nownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans (such as the\ndeferredcompensationand401(k)planmatches).\nThe Committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonable risk-taking behavior. The\nvalue of shorter-term incentives (including cash bonus awards and performance conditions for awards of\nRSUs) is substantially exceeded by longer-term incentives (including equity awards that vest over up to five\nyears) and share ownership requirements, which the Committee believes reward sustained performance that\nis aligned with shareholder interests. In addition, the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Rule\n10D-1 Policy on Recovery of Incentive Compensation (described more fully below) require or enable the\nCommitteetoseekthereturnofincentivecompensationimproperlyearned,dependingonthecircumstances.\nPeerCompanies\nFor fiscal 2023, the Committee primarily considered executive compensation data obtained from\nproxy statements for the following peer companies: Walmart Inc., The Home Depot, Inc., Lowe’s Companies,\nInc., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corporation, The Kroger Company, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.,\nBest Buy Inc., BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc., PriceSmart, Inc., Wesfarmers Ltd., and Carrefour SA.The\npeercompanieswereselectedbecausetheyarerecognizedassuccessfulretailersandthreeofthemoperate\nmembership clubs. The Committee took into account that the current market capitalization of two of the\ncompanies is substantially larger than the Company. The Committee did not use the comparable company\ndatatosetmid-pointsorotherspecificquantitativecomparisonsofexecutivecompensation;itusedthemonly\nforgeneralreference.\nEquityCompensation\nIf fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and fully vested, equity\ncompensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers. RSU grants to executive\nofficersaregenerallyperformance-based,withperformance-vestingoveraone-yearperiod,time-vestingover\nfive years, and vesting for long service. The Board and the Committee believe that vesting over up to five\n14\nyears helps to foster motivation over the longer term. Following satisfaction of performance targets, RSUs\nbecome time-vested RSUs that, subject to accelerated vesting for long service (described below) vest 20%\nupon the first anniversary of the grant date (following the determination by the Committee that the\nperformancecriteriahavebeensatisfied)and20%vestovereachoftheensuingfouryears.(VestingofRSUs\nawarded to non-executive officers and employees is not performance-based.) To the extent accelerated or\ntime-vesting requirements are met, RSUs are settled and paid in shares of common stock (net of shares\nwithheld for taxes). Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered\nRSUs.\nAll officers and employees who receive RSU grants (except as noted below with respect to Mr.\nJelinek) receive accelerated vesting once they have achieved long service with the Company (33% vesting\ncredited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after 25 years of service, 66% vesting after 30 years of\nservice, and 100% vesting after 35 years of service, with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining\nvesting period). This accelerated vesting, following satisfaction of the performance conditions as to executive\nofficers, entitles individuals to receive shares within ten business days of the anniversary of the grant date or\nof the initial grant date if the years of service requirement has been met prior to the grant date. In the case of\nMr. Jelinek, the fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 awards are not subject to accelerated vesting prior to termination\nfor long service and instead vest under the normal five-year vesting schedule. For awards vested on October\n22,2022,allotherNamedExecutiveOfficersreceived100%long-servicevesting.\nThe criteria for the fiscal 2023 performance-based grants were (versus fiscal 2022) a 3% increase in\nnetsalesora2%increaseinpre-taxincome(bothadjustedforchangesinforeigncurrenciesandnormalized\nfortheextraweekinfiscal2023).TheCommitteedeterminedthatbothgoalswereexceeded.Accordingly,the\nexecutive officers who received performance-based grants earned all of the RSUs granted, subject to time-\nbased and long-service vesting. All recipients, other than Mr. Jelinek and one executive officer who has not\ncompleted25yearsofservice,receivedacceleratedvestingforlongservicefortheseRSUs.\nThe Board adopted in July 2008 a fixed date of October 22 for RSU grants, with exceptions as\napproved in advance by the Committee. For fiscal 2023, RSU grants were made on October 22, 2022, and\nthe performance criteria for the grants were established in November 2022. All grants in fiscal 2023 were\nmadeundertheCompany’s2019IncentivePlan,approvedbytheshareholdersinJanuary2019.\nOtherCompensation\nThe Company provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits of a type offered to all other\nemployees in most respects. The value of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executive’s\ntotal compensation. Key benefits include paid vacation, premiums for long-term disability insurance, a\nmatching contribution and a discretionary 401(k) plan contribution, and premiums for health insurance and\nbasic life insurance. In addition, the Company maintains a non-qualified deferred-compensation plan for the\nbenefit of over 1,000 employees, including the Named Executive Officers. The plan provides that the first\n$10,000 of an employee’s contributions may be matched 50% by the Company, subject to certain\nlimitations. This match vests over time. The Company does not maintain a pension plan or post-retirement\nmedical plan for any employee. There are Company matching contributions, which are capped, for charitable\ncontributions by many employees, including the Named Executive Officers. The Committee believes the\nbenefits are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly-qualified\nexecutiveofficers.\n2023CompensationoftheChiefExecutiveOfficer\nIn addition to considering the Company’s compensation policies generally, the Committee reviews\nexecutive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the Chief Executive Officer.\nNear the end of calendar 2022, the Committee approved the renewal of the written employment contract with\nMr. Jelinek, related to service during calendar 2023, providing for: a salary increase to $1,150,000 for\ncalendar 2023, an increase of $50,000 from the prior fiscal year, excluding the one-time required vacation\npayout (which was required of U.S. employees) in the prior year; a target cash bonus of $600,000, an\nincrease of $100,000 from the prior fiscal year, determined by the Board or the Committee, and an RSU\naward determined by the Board or the Committee. Apart from the change-in-control provision in the\n15\nCompany’s equity plan applicable to all grantees (described below under “Potential Payments Upon\nTermination or Change-in-Control”), none of Mr. Jelinek or any other employee has or had any change-in-\ncontrolarrangementwiththeCompany.\nFor fiscal 2023, the Committee granted 31,369 performance-based RSUs to Mr. Jelinek, a 94%\nincrease from fiscal 2022, based on the closing share price at the time of the grant. This compensation is\nprimarily for his service as CEO during fiscal 2023 and in part as compensation for the eleven years during\nhis service when Mr. Jelinek's compensation substantially lagged that of most peers, despite his presiding\nover superior performance. Even considering this increase, raising total compensation to $16.9 million, CEOs\nof six retail peers received higher compensation, according to their most recent proxy statements. The\nCommittee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were exceeded, and all of\ntheRSUsgrantedwereearned.\nFor fiscal 2023, the bonus amount for Mr. Jelinek was determined by the Committee in November\n2022:(i)$250,000ofbonuseligibilitywasdeterminedbytheCompany'sattainmentofitspre-taxincomegoal,\nwhich was exceeded in fiscal 2023 (the goal was $8.7 billion, on a generally accepted accounting principles\nbasis; actual pre-tax income, adjusted for changes in foreign currencies and an unusual item, as provided for\nin the plan, charges of $391 million predominantly related to the discontinuation of the Company's charter\nshipping activities, was $8.9 billion); (ii) $250,000 of bonus eligibility was determined based on net sales\nadjustedforchangesinforeigncurrencies(thegoalwas$246.5billion,whichwasnotmet);and(iii)$100,000\nof bonus eligibility was determined by environmental and social objectives for achievement of quantitative\nperformance metrics (including metrics concerning diversity equity and inclusion, resource consumption, and\nother environmental-related areas). The potential payment attributable to the first two performance measures\nwas from zero to up to 120%, based on the level of achievement. The potential payment attributable to the\nthird performance measure was all or nothing, depending on whether a majority of the quantitative metrics\nwas achieved. For fiscal 2023, the pre-tax income component of the bonus earned was $262,500, based on\nthe Company's achieving 102% of the pre-tax profit target.The sales component of the bonus was $0, based\non the Company falling short of the sales target. The quantitative environmental and social targets were met,\nentitlingMr.Jelinekto$100,000.\n2023CompensationofthePresidentandChiefOperatingOfficer\nFor fiscal 2023, the Committee granted 14,639 performance-based RSUs to Mr. Vachris, a 21%\nincreasefromfiscal2022,basedontheclosingsharepriceatthetimeofthegrant.Theamountawardedwas\nbased on recommendations of Mr. Jelinek and approved by the Compensation Committee. The performance\ncriteriawere,asnotedabove,exceededandMr.VachrisearnedalloftheRSUsgranted.\nThe salary for Mr. Vachris was based upon the recommendation of Mr. Jelinek, who focused on the\namount of increase deserved over the prior year’s salary level. Base salary levels for Mr. Vachris increased\n6%overthepreviousfiscalyear,excludingtheone-timerequiredvacationpayout(whichwasrequiredofU.S.\nemployees)intheprioryear.\nMr.Vachris,receivedacashbonusof$248,000.Thepotentialbonusamountswerehigheryear-over-\nyear because Mr. Vachris served a full year as President. The potential bonus amount increased from\n$245,900 to $464,000. This amount includes $160,000 based on the achievement of targets relating to sales\nand $160,000 based on the achievement of targets relating to pre-tax income.

In addition, up to $80,000 in potential related to environmental and social objectives for\nachievement of quantitative performance metrics (as discussed below for the other Named Executive\nOfficers). For fiscal 2023, the pre-tax income component of the bonus earned was $168,000, based on the\nCompany's achieving 102% of the pre-tax profit target. The sales component of the bonus was $0, based on\nthe Company falling short of the sales target. The quantitative environmental and social targets were met,\nentitlingMr.Vachristo$80,000.\n16\n2023CompensationofOtherNamedExecutiveOfficers\nThe most significant component of compensation in fiscal 2023 was performance-based RSUs. RSU\namounts awarded to Messrs. Galanti, Miller, and Riel were 10,457, 8,196, and 7,429. Performance-based\nRSUlevels increased3%forMr.MillerandMr.Riel and19%for Mr.Galantiover theprioryear,basedonthe\nclosing share price at the time of the grant. The amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of\nMr. Jelinek and approved by the Compensation Committee before the grants. The performance criteria were,\nas noted above, exceeded, and the Named Executive Officers earned all of the RSUs granted, with\naccelerated-vestingforlongserviceandfurthertime-basedvesting.\nSalaries for other Named Executive Officers were based upon the recommendation of Mr. Jelinek,\nwho focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior year’s salary level. Base salary levels for\ntheseofficersincreasedbetween2%and15%overthepreviousfiscalyear.\nThe Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Jelinek and Mr. Vachris) received cash bonuses of\n$124,000. The potential bonus amount was $232,000, which did not change from last year. This amount\nincluded $80,000 based on the achievement of targets relating to sales and $80,000 based on the\nachievement of targets relating to pre-tax income. The potential payment attributable to each of these\nperformancegoalswasfromzeroupto120%oftheawardtargetamount,basedonthelevelofachievement.\nUp to $40,000 in potential related to environmental and social objectives: $24,000 relating to achievement of\nquantitative performance metrics (including metrics concerning diversity equity and inclusion, resource\nconsumption, and other environmental-related areas) on an all or nothing basis depending upon whether a\nmajority of the quantitative metrics were satisfied; and up to $16,000 based on discretionary assessment by\nthe Chief Executive Officer of the officer's environmental and social achievements (including, without\nlimitation, progress in controlling emissions). For fiscal 2023, the pre-tax income component of the bonus\nearned was $84,000, based on the Company achieving 102% of the pre-tax profit target. The sales\ncomponent of the bonus was $0, based on the Company falling short of the sales target. The environmental\nand social objective bonus was earned, which included the achievement of quantitative performance metrics\nand100%ofthediscretionaryamount,asrecommendedbyMr.Jelinek.\nClawbackPolicy\nTheCompensationCommitteeadoptedaRule10D-1PolicyonRecoveryofIncentiveCompensation,\neffectiveOctober2,2023,inaccordancewithRule10D-1oftheSecuritiesExchangeActof1934andNasdaq\nlisting standards. The Rule 10D-1 Policy applies to current and former executive officers of the Company as\ndefined in Rule 10D-1, including the Named Executive Officers, and will be administered by the\nCompensation Committee. In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement to\ncorrect material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws,\nincluding restatements that correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the\npreviously issued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were\ncorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, it is the Company's policy to recover\nerroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by its executive officers. The recovery of such\ncompensation applies regardless of whether an executive officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise cause\norcontributedtotherequirementforarestatement.\nIn addition, under the clawback policy in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which still applies to\nthe extent not superseded by the Rule 10D-1 Policy, the Company will seek to recover, at the direction of the\nCommittee after it has considered the costs and benefits, incentive compensation (including, without\nlimitation, any bonus, incentive payment, and equity award) awarded or paid to an officer for a fiscal period if\nthe result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or\notherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment. Where the incentive\ncompensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Committee may determine in its discretion the\namount, if any, by which the payment or award should be reduced. In addition, if an officer engaged in\nintentionalmisconduct(asdeterminedbytheCommitteeinitssolediscretion)thatcontributedtotheawardor\npayment of incentive compensation to the officer that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the\nabsenceofthemisconduct,theCompanymaytakeotherremedialandrecoveryaction,asdeterminedbythe\nCommittee.\n17\nStockOwnershipRequirements\nExecutive officers are required by the end of each calendar year to own and retain shares of\nCompany common stock representing in value at least three times (seven times for the Chief Executive\nOfficer)thebasesalaryoftheofficerineffectatthebeginningofthefiscalyear.Newly-promotedofficershave\ntwenty-four months to achieve compliance. The Nominating and Governance Committee may authorize an\nextension should the timing present an undue burden.All executive officers were in compliance at the end of\ncalendar2022.\nHedgingandPledgingPolicies\nThe Corporate Governance Guidelines, prohibit transactions involving hedging of the Company's\nequity securities by directors, officers, and employees and prohibit pledging of the Company's equity\nsecurities by directors and executive officers. The prohibition on transactions involving hedging includes any\ninstrumentortransaction,includingputoptionsandforward-salecontracts,throughwhichanindividualoffsets\nor reduces exposure to the risk of price fluctuations in a corresponding equity security. Equity securities\ninclude common stock, voting preferred stock and options and other securities exercisable for, or convertible\ninto,settledin,ormeasuredbyreferenceto,anyotherequitysecuritydeterminedonanas-exercisedandas-\nconverted basis. The equity securities attributable to a director or executive officer for these purposes are\nthose attributable under either Section 13 or Section 16 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934.All directors\nandexecutiveofficersareincompliancewiththispolicy.\nConclusion\nThe Committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to\neach of the Named Executive Officers is reasonable and appropriate. The compensation of the Named\nExecutive Officers is significantly tied to the Company’s performance and the return to shareholders. The\nCommitteebelievesthatitscompensationprogramswillallowtheCompanytocontinuetoattractandretaina\ntop-performingmanagementteam.\nREPORTOFTHECOMPENSATIONCOMMITTEEOFTHEBOARDOFDIRECTORS\nThe Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has submitted the following\nreportforinclusioninthisProxyStatement:\nThe Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis contained in this Proxy Statement.

Under the Company’s 2019 Incentive Plan, in the event of a\n“fundamental transaction” or “change in control”: (i) with respect to stock awards that are assumed,\nsubstituted or continued, if the Company terminates the participant’s employment without “cause” or the\nparticipant terminates with “good reason” upon or during the 12-month period following the fundamental\ntransaction or change in control, the stock award will become fully vested and any performance conditions\nimposed with respect to the award will be deemed to be achieved at the greater of the actual levels of\nachievementasofthedateofsuchterminationandthetargetperformancelevels;and(ii)ifthestockawardis\nnot assumed, substituted or continued, the Board will fully accelerate time-based awards and provide for pro-\nrata acceleration of performance-based stock awards at the greater of actual levels of achievement or target,\nor cancel the awards in exchange for cash payments to the participant. The plan has detailed definitions\nof “good reason”, “cause,” “change in control” and “fundamental transaction.” Generally speaking, “good\nreason,” except as otherwise defined in an employment agreement, is defined as a material diminution in the\nparticipant’s authority, duties or responsibilities or a material change in geographic location at which the\nparticipant must perform services. “Cause” is defined as dishonesty, fraud, misconduct, disclosure or misuse\nof confidential information, conviction of, or a plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony or similar offense,\nhabitual absence from work for reasons other than illness, intentional conduct that could cause significant\ninjury to the Company or an affiliate, or habitual abuse of alcohol or a controlled substance. “Change in\ncontrol” is defined as the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a majority of the Board is replaced in\nany two-year period other than by directors approved by existing directors; or (ii) any person or group\nacquiresshareshaving30%ormoreofthevotingpowerofalloutstandingshares;or(iii)amergerorinwhich\noutstanding shares are converted into shares of another company or other securities (of either the Company\nor another company) or cash or other property. “Fundamental transaction” is defined as the merger of the\nCompanywithanotherentityinatransactioninwhichtheCompanyisnotthesurvivingentityorif,asaresult\nof any other transaction or event, other securities are substituted for Company shares or shares may no\nlongerbeissued.\nThe Company’s Seventh Restated 2002 Incentive Plan and its predecessor plans provide that in\nconnection with a “change in control,” the Board may take any one or more of the following actions: (i)\narrange for the substitution of options or other compensatory awards of equity securities other than shares\n(including,ifappropriate,equitysecuritiesofanentityotherthantheCompany)inexchangeforstockawards;\n(ii) accelerate the vesting and termination of outstanding stock awards so that stock awards can be exercised\nin full before or otherwise in connection with the closing or completion of the transaction or event, but then\nterminate;or(iii)cancelstockawardsinexchangeforcashpaymentstoparticipants.Theplanrequiresthatin\nthe event of a “fundamental transaction” the Board shall do one or more of the foregoing, contingent on the\nclosingorcompletionofthefundamentaltransaction.\nCompensationCommitteeInterlocksandInsiderParticipation\nNo member of the Compensation Committee is an executive officer or former officer of the Company.\nNo executive officer of the Company served on the board of directors of any entity whose executive officers\nincludedadirectoroftheCompany.\n24\nCEOPAYRATIO\nAs required by SEC rules, we are reporting the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to\nthe annual total compensation of our “median employee.” The latter is an estimate calculated consistent with\nSEC rules, based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. SEC rules\nallowavarietyofmethodologiesandexclusionsandpermitreasonableestimatesandassumptions.\nIdentificationoftheMedianEmployee\nAspermittedbytheSECrules,weselectedamedianemployeewhohadcompensationsimilartoour\n2022 median employee because our 2022 median employee was subsequently promoted resulting in a\nchange to his or her compensation. There has been no change in our employee population or compensation\narrangements that would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. Last year, the year to date\nperiod ended July 3, 2022, was utilized to determine the median employee. At that date, we had\napproximately 300,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 198,000 were located in the United\nStates and its territories. As permitted by SEC rules, we excluded employees in China, France, Iceland,\nSpain, and Taiwan. As a result, the “considered population” for identifying the median employee was\napproximately 289,000. The pool included full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees. For\ndetermining the median employee, to the extent received, we used a combination of salary, bonus, equity\ncompensation, and other measurable benefits. Non-U.S. employees’ compensation was converted to U.S.\ndollars using an average exchange-rate for the year to date period. For fiscal 2023, the median employee in\ntheconsideredpopulationhadatotalcompensationof$50,202.\nRatio\nThe CEO’s total compensation as shown in the Summary Compensation Table was $16,870,623.\nBased upon the estimates, assumptions, and methodology described above, the pay ratio calculation is\n336:1.This ratio may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in industries,\nscope of international operations, business models and scale, as well as the differences in estimates,\nassumptions,andmethodologies.\nSupplementalRatio\nApproximately 41% of the “considered population” were part-time, seasonal or temporary workers,\nwhich significantly impacts the ratio shown above. We believe it is appropriate to present a supplemental\ncalculation using the same methodology as above except that it includes only workers who are full-time.\nUsing this methodology, the median employee has a total compensation of $66,783, resulting in a pay ratio\ncalculationof253:1.\nPAYVERSUSPERFORMANCE\nAs required by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, this section describes the relationship between\ncompensation actually paid and certain financial performance measures of the Company.

The report should be made public, produced at reasonable\ncost,andomitproprietaryinformation.\nSupporting Statement: In 2022, activist investors driven by a radical climate catastrophist agenda forced\nCostco to adopt unrealistic greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals, culminating in net-zero emissions by\n2050orsooner.2InimposingthesetargetsupontheCompany,however,itdoesnotappearthattheseactivist\nshareholdershavefullyconsideredtherisksthatdecarbonizationonpoliticallydrivenschedulesmightentail.\nClaims about the need for decarbonization at all, but especially by some activist-generated date certain, are\nbased on a long series of assumptions that are either counterfactual or insufficiently examined. For decades,\nfor instance, claims have been made that action must be taken before some date, or it will be too late.3 If\nthose claims were right, it's too late for decarbonization to matter now, so we should be building up economic\nresourcestodealwithclimatechange.Iftheywerewrong,thentheoddsarehighthatcurrentclaimsarealso\nwrong.\nCostco's decarbonization will be meaningless if other countries do not follow the same decarbonization\nschedules, and there is abundant evidence that they will not.4 The United States government has never\nmandated net-zero by statute or authorized regulatory action,5 and is unlikely ever to do so; this contravenes\nthe assumptions of \"stranded asset\" analysis. If decarbonization is neither required nor technologically\nfeasible, forcing the Company to arbitrarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions — including emissions outside\nof its control — will undoubtedly increase operating costs and harm shareholder investments.

Additionally, underpinning these focus areas will be an emphasis on supplier\nengagement,buyereducation,andITsystemdevelopmentfordatamonitoringandcollection.\nThere are many challenges to be faced in achieving these goals, most notably that significant progress on\nreducing Scope 3 emissions depends upon advances by our suppliers, who number in the thousands. The\npresence of these and other hurdles does not, however, dictate that no effort be made at all.The Plan adopts\na balanced approach, specifically recognizing that \"our transition to a low carbon business model also should\nrepresent a just transition for our employees, members, suppliers and the communities we serve.\" The\n6\nhttps://eprinc.org/a-critical-assessment-of-the-ieas-net-zero-scenario-esg-and-the-cessation-of-investment-in-new-oil-and-gas-fields/\n32\ncommitments in the Plan are substantial; they do not, however, include a requirement for \"net-zero emissions\nby 2050 or sooner.\" Some elements of the Plan have the benefit of lowering costs for the Company while\nreducing emissions. Reducing energy usage and enhancing refrigeration efficiency, for example, enhance the\nCompany's profitability. The Board and the Company are fully cognizant, however, that reducing emissions\nwillnotoccurwithoutcosts;continuingimplementationofthePlanwilloccurwithmonitoringandevaluationof\nthosecosts,withtheobjectiveofachievingajusttransition.\nThe Board and the Company also have noted that the Plan, and others like it, will not now prevent the\nimpacts of global warming, which every day are more evident. The world is now instead in a state of\nattempting to mitigate and adapt to these impacts. That reality, however, means that efforts should be\nenhanced–notabandoned.\nTheBoardofDirectorsrecommendsavoteAGAINSTProposal4.\nOTHERMATTERS\nNeither the Board nor management intends to bring before the Annual Meeting any business other\nthan the matters referred to in the Notice of Meeting and this Proxy Statement.

Management believes that this provides a fairer measure (as compared to U.S. dollars) of\nperformance subject to the Company's control. Non-GAAPfinancial measures are not intended to be used as\nanalternativetodirectcomparablemeasuresinaccordancewithGAAPandmaynotbecomparabletosimilar\nmeasuresreportedbyothercompanies.\nIn the discussion of net sales adjusted for changes in foreign currencies, we refer to the impact of\nchanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange\nrates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S.\ndollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the\ncurrentandpriorfiscalyearcurrencyexchangerates.\nThefollowingtablereflectsthecalculationofnetsalesadjustedforchangesinforeigncurrencies:\n2023 2022 2021\nNetsales $ 237,710 $ 222,730 $ 192,052\nChangesinforeigncurrencies 3,484 1,762 (2,759)\nNetsalesadjustedforchangesinforeigncurrencies $ 241,194 $ 224,492 $ 189,293\n35"
