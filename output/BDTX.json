(Nasdaq: BDTX), a clinical-stage oncology company developing MasterKey therapies that target families of oncogenic mutations in patients with cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We are focused on the advancement of BDTX-1535 for the treatment of patients with EGFRm NSCLC and look forward to providing clinical updates on our Phase 2 trial for both newly diagnosed patients and patients with relapsed/refractory EGFRm NSCLC in the first quarter of 2025,” said Mark Velleca, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Black Diamond Therapeutics. “We also look forward to sharing feedback on a registrational path in relapsed/refractory EGFRm NSCLC following a meeting planned with the FDA in the first quarter of 2025.”\n\n**Recent Developments & Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n**BDTX-1535:**\n\n  * In September 2024, Black Diamond announced initial Phase 2 data demonstrating encouraging clinical responses and durability of BDTX-1535 in patients with relapsed/refractory epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 200 mg daily dose of BDTX-1535 was selected for pivotal development, showing robust EGFRm target coverage and a favorable tolerability profile with no new safety signals observed. A preliminary overall response rate (ORR) of 42% was seen in 19 patients with known osimertinib resistance EGFR mutations (either C797S or PACC “P-loop αC-helix compressing” mutations). Encouraging durability was noted with a duration of response (DOR) of approximately eight months or more in the first three patients who achieved a partial response (PR), while 14 of the 19 patients remained on treatment.\n  * In September 2024, Black Diamond presented a poster analyzing real-world treatment outcomes for newly diagnosed NSCLC patients with non-classical EGFR mutations (NCMs) at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The analyses revealed the presence of a broad spectrum of NCMs, including PACC mutations, and allowed association with real-world treatment practices and therapeutic outcomes. Findings further demonstrated that current treatment practices for patients with NCMs are heterogenous: 36% of patients received osimertinib or afatinib and 60% of patients received chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy.\n  * In October 2024, the Ivy Brain Tumor Center, which is sponsoring a “window of opportunity” (also known as Phase 0/1 “Trigger”) trial of BDTX-1535 in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG), presented updated study results demonstrating that BDTX-1535 effectively penetrates rarely accessible regions of glioblastoma and suppresses EGFR signaling in patient tumors at the 19th Meeting of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology. These encouraging data provide rationale for the program’s expansion into newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with EGFR aberrations.\n  * In the first quarter of 2025, Black Diamond expects to disclose initial Phase 2 data in first-line EGFRm NSCLC patients with non-classical mutations as well as updated Phase 2 results in the recurrent EGFRm NSCLC setting (NCT05256290) together with an update on a potential registrational path for the recurrent setting.\n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * In October 2024, Black Diamond announced a corporate restructuring plan to prioritize its resources on advancing and optimizing development plans for its lead program BDTX-1535, strengthen operational efficiencies and extend the Company’s expected cash runway into the second quarter of 2026. As part of the restructuring, Black Diamond also deprioritized its Phase 1 RAS/RAF inhibitor, BDTX-4933, and is actively seeking partnerships for the program.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Black Diamond ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $112.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments compared to $131.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operations was $11.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $18.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Research and Development Expenses:** Research and development (R&D) expenses were $12.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $16.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to workforce efficiencies and reduced spending on early discovery projects.\n  * **General and Administrative Expenses:** General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to a decrease in consulting and other professional fees.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.6 million, as compared to $23.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\n  * Black Diamond ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $112.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments which the Company believes is sufficient to fund its anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\n\n**About Black Diamond Therapeutics** Black Diamond Therapeutics is a clinical-stage oncology company developing MasterKey therapies that target families of oncogenic mutations in patients with cancer.

BDTX-1535 has demonstrated robust Phase 2 clinical activity across a broad spectrum of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRm) in patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nIn Q1 2025, Black Diamond anticipates sharing initial Phase 2 data for BDTX-1535 in the frontline setting for patients with EGFRm NSCLC. Also in Q1 2025, the Company plans to present updated Phase 2 results for BDTX-1535 in patients with recurrent EGFRm NSCLC and a potential registration path in the recurrent setting based on feedback from the FDA.\n\nBlack Diamond is actively seeking partnerships as it deprioritizes its BDTX-4933 program in RAF/RAS-mutant solid tumors. To enable focused investment in BDTX-1535, Black Diamond has also taken steps to optimize operations, including a reduction in force, while retaining core drug development and management expertise. As part of the restructuring, Chief Business Officer and Chief Financial Officer Fang Ni and Chief People Officer Elizabeth Montgomery are departing the Company. Erika Jones, Senior Vice President of Finance and Principal Accounting Officer, has been appointed Principal Financial Officer of the Company. Cost savings from the restructuring and other actions described above are expected to be sufficient to fund operations into Q2 2026.\n\n“BDTX-1535 is a well-tolerated oral TKI with the potential to benefit patients with EGFRm NSCLC across multiple lines of therapy,” said Mark Velleca, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Black Diamond Therapeutics. “We remain focused on advancing BDTX-1535 and presenting additional Phase 2 data in Q1 2025. I am deeply grateful to each member of the Black Diamond team, whose hard work and valuable contributions have brought us to the threshold of pivotal development for our lead program.”\n\n**About BDTX-1535**\n\nBDTX-1535 is an oral, brain-penetrant MasterKey inhibitor of oncogenic EGFR mutations in NSCLC, including classical mutations, non-classical mutations, and the C797S resistance mutation. BDTX-1535 is a fourth-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that potently inhibits, based on preclinical data, more than 50 EGFR mutations expressed across a diverse group of patients with NSCLC in multiple lines of therapy. Based on preclinical data, BDTX-1535 also inhibits EGFR extracellular domain mutations and alterations commonly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and avoids paradoxical activation observed with earlier generation reversible TKIs. A “window of opportunity” trial of BDTX-1535 in patients with GBM is ongoing ([NCT06072586](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SsF1a11E09yRv_ohxx8NWDviE45oxccpaamyeDQJpR2RE753F9UBDT6pkxxiWtRaEpdc2yr_fwfOdCkhBPCn5Xwmu_d95okDR7LhoGh4ic2d4NPNHRRc6UDZEBSujfUtCcxtD4W1QvitUio-FOUelmkJ-cP-6zOCeYBMEgIkYLrVk6yZ50EZ1fKujT7sFLnebNkMlW5RBzkbfOJ8B9Kasgatxzs-4jMHI_xYeQ-wlcrcY0pcolSjYJjGEk85j5HO2SwxQMAwGRLeYR624Chzww==)) and a Phase 2 trial is ongoing in patients with NSCLC ([NCT05256290](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_VeTShHbP6YNv8Lr4OeyETp325INKhQ7UywK7zqH6y0iLxEGoj9q7KSRvZy117r7vicubYoiiQtqxChQKx92Wx12qrryqP1EU0IDhYiC6O5f4uGNzeUigzwslLEpQORtCqPFfceB60jhSb63AhM6tsBDGufeIzj1Rbjmdn5G4tHw9yv5H_x9Rqx41Se9hh9sA3zC3xBNY5vi_MwY0CDuLNjHj-Elr_rnzDudRrtEwY6TlTurta9hMbuCIyERVAD31KLWEsgpqNfDfr3AtxazaZ_oJwwjKJNCbDSzu5WvtTRz0_yeNvYeohKv1hhrvfM5)).\n\n**About Black Diamond Therapeutics**\n\nBlack Diamond Therapeutics is a clinical-stage oncology company developing MasterKey therapies that target families of oncogenic mutations in patients with cancer.
